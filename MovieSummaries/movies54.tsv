Soon after, we are introduced to Lonigan and Tony's leader Abagail Bratowski  who is disguised as a nun to avoid being recognized because she's wanted by the police in several states. The three head to the car lot with Murphy on their tail, but his car soon gets disabled by jumping over a hill. Then they pick up another of their cronies Rosco  who has a habit of urinating 3 times in one hour, something that Tony points out later on in the film. Much to their dismay, they find out that the car is being bought by two buddies Al  and Elmo . As they speed out of the car lot, the gang begins to pursue them, but Al soon gets pulled over for speeding by two cops, they eventually get killed and their car blows up thanks to a drive-by shooting conducted by Abagail. Tired of distractions and complications, Lonigan decides to purchase a homer of his own so he and the gang can track them down more easily. When they catch up with them again, they manage to disrupt a street concert in the park by knocking over the stage, musicians, and sound equipment. The chase is once again cut short when Abagail demands Lonigan to pull over so she can change out of her nun costume, causing another delay. Thinking that they lost them, Al and Elmo pull their gasoline-lacking car into a service station. While they're getting gas, Elmo notices a number of bags of heroin in the back seat. He pulls Al out of the phone booth, causing him to rip the receiver out. Al, irritably, listens to Elmo about the heroin he found, they decide to keep them so they can be rich instead of being hunted down by the cops and getting killed. As they begin to leave, Lonigan spots them and Al immediately peels out of the station, with Elmo forcing to take a shortcut by running into the woods, with Abagail and Rosco on his tail. Lonigan and Tony go after Al, thinking it will be an easier way to get rid of Abagail since Lonigan has had enough of her.

Al eventually loses them at a construction site by temporarily disabling Lonigan's car with an earthmover.

Dhodial Pheasantry, beyond everything else that it has done for conservation, and pheasant conservation in particular, put Pakistan on the map. The documentary aims at one thing alone - to leave its viewers with facts that allow them to decide for themselves whether it is Hazara University or Dhodial Pheasantry that is faced with an unjust inevitability. Adding a spiritual element to this film that investigates the nature of conservation is the story of Welsh ecologist Robert Whale. Robert Whale's decision to get married and stay back in Pakistan is an important element of the story being told. He made a deal with God, that if he caught a glimpse of the infamous Western Tragopan on film, he would embrace Islam. Now known as Rab Nawaz, he converted to Islam in 1998. Furthermore, the documentary unravels the on-going conflict of the pheasantry’s re-location to alternate land such as the Jaba Sheep Farmhttp://nwfp.gov.pk/Agriculture/AttDept/Dairy.php, in order to accommodate Hazara University’s eventual expansion. The farm’s director, Dr. Ghufranullah, has made clear that their livestock exceeds 600. The land that they have is enough only to cater to their own needs, as opposed to accommodating the needs of Dhodial Pheasantry as well. Hazara University wants to give preference to humans over birds. It is aiming for an eventual student count of 20,000 along the course of the expansion. Chief Conservatorhttp://nwfp.gov.pk/GoServices/NewsDetails.php?NewsId=110 of the Wildlife Department, Dr. Mumtaz Malikhttp://www.mardan.com/id105.html is concerned with the process of shifting habitats. Sometimes, birds can die as a result of tremendous stress level, which is incomparable to human stress level. Another huge issue is reports that the poultry farm that used to exist at the Jaba location earlier experienced bird flu and other diseases. As a result, entire flocks of poultry were wiped out. This is reinforced by the Zareef Khan Foundationhttp://www.zkf.org.pk/’s president, Abid Zareef, whose NGO works for education empowerment. He maintains that there is the risk of transmission of both sheep and pheasant diseases. There is more danger in the spreading of diseases as there are no crosswinds because the location is surrounded by hills.

Jones succeeds in being hired as Smith's bodyguard and accompanies Smith to the Redvale building, where Smith is supposed to obtain $100,000,000 in cash.

Their boyfriends are interrogated by the cops, and one of them, Ananthu goes into depression. He happens to be the boyfriend of one of the dead girls, Gowri. The case remains unresolved. A year later, investigating officer Sreekanth's niece Parvati joins the school, and is given the same room where Gowri used to stay. Soon Parvati starts acting weird, which is noted by her classmates, and even the school driver and peon start to also see Gowri appearing at night in the school corridors. Gowri's spirit soon appears before Parvati, seeking her help. At times, it also gets into Parvati, making her act possessed. It even makes Parvati go to Ananthu's house and cheer him up. It is then shown that Gowri and her two friends were very happy go lucky characters in the school, and something happens during a picnic which changes their lives forever. The film then moves to Aloyshi, the school music and dance teacher, and a lecturer Jennifer, who seem to be very friendly. Aloyshi takes a liking for Parvati, and encourages her to give splendid performances at all college functions, which she does, as Gowri's spirit would be doing that for her. Soon afterwards, Gowri's spirit, in the guise of Parvati, goes to Jennifer's house and immolates the whole place, killing her. Sreekanth sees a laptop at Jennifer's house and gets it repaired. Later, he finds Jennifer's laptop loaded with nude pictures of the girls staying in the hotel. He orders investigation into the matter. Sreekanth also comes to know that Jennifer was an immoral woman. He visits Aloyshi and notes that the latter is a very shady character. Fed up with Parvati's maniacal episodes due to possession, Sreekanth calls doctors but they are not able to help much. Finally he calls a Tantrik who casts Parvati/Gowri under a spell and makes her tell all that is going on. It is then revealed that the music teacher is a womanizer and he actually tried to rape Gowri at the picnic. It is also shown that he has taken nude pictures of the girls, and threatened to reveal them to everyone if they did not give in to his desires. Jennifer had been hand in glove with Aloyshi. The panic stricken girls then committed suicide in the school, but even though Gowri would not be fully dead, Aloyshi and Jennifer arrive early at the scene in the school and give her more poison to hasten her death. Thus, Gowri has returned for revenge. And she wants to do it through Parvati. Aloyshi is now arrested by cops but he manages to get bail. Gowri's father attacks him on the way but Aloyshi throws him into the river and escapes. Gowri /Parvati goes to Aloyshi's house one night and throws him from the terrace, thus killing him. Sreekanth arrives too late, and returns home to find that Parvati had never gone out of the house that night! With her revenge now complete, Tantrik orders Gowri to leave, but she says that she wants to take her beloved Ananthu with her, and goes as Parvati to kill him and take his spirit away. Sreekanth runs to the hill where Parvati is about to jump off the hill with a reluctant Ananthu, and manages to put a protective bangle on this hand,thus dis-powering Parvati. Parvati is then taken to the tantrik, and he drives Gowri's spirit out of her. The spirit bids goodbye to Parvati,and she returns to normal. The film ends with Parvati joining school again with the old classmates.

The first two are about two couples whose lives are extreme opposites but they share one thing in common: an unexpected pregnancy. Carmine and Sasha live in a carefree world and the arrival of a child blows their middle-class life to the ground: behind the illusion of their fancy condominium and their successful careers hides a couple that is in pain and living with secrets and lies. Meanwhile, Justine and Seb are freedom seekers that live day by day on the streets of Montreal.

Now he has found a new purpose for his life: revenge, which brings him from Calgary to Montreal as he attempts to hunt down his daughter's murderer.

Baba is murdered amidst tight security in the premises of a special court in Mangalore where he was supposed to give evidence about the foul play behind an earlier communal riot. The evil syndicate headed by 'Janab' Hyderali Hassan ([[Saikumar  which felt that their existence will be questioned if Baba were to reveal the truths about the communal violence riots incited by them, silences him using a hired killer, Kala Purohit Khan. As a matter of fact, the communal violence following Baba's murder are triggered and intensified by Hyderali himself, to throw the region in a state of chaos. He has other sinister motives also, like having the huge amount of land left behind by the fleeing population to himself for building a private sea port through which he hopes to pump illicit money, drugs and weapons into the state. Bharatchandran makes a late entry into the film, almost near the end of the first half. The Chief Minister of the state, Thomas Chacko ([[Vijayaraghavan  entrusts the investigation of the Baba murder with Bharatchandran. He and his team of an assistant officer Anwar  and Dy. SP Pookkoya  report to IG of Police Habib Basheer . Bharatchandran works his way into the hierarchy of the Hyderali syndicate, starting with Shweta Nachappa, a Karnataka police officer who was on duty on the day of the murder and who seemed to know about the murder beforehand. Hyderali silences Shweta after he finds out that Bharatchandran is trailing her. This doesn't seem to deter him, he spits fire as he courses his way through to Hyderali. Mentions are made about Bharatchandran's past during the nine years that is supposed to have elapsed since he terminated Mohan Thomas. Incidentally, this is the actual time-frame between the release of the two movies. He is told to have been under suspension for the major part of that time and even served a term in jail for his actions. His love interest, the lawyer Indu  eventually became his wife and got him acquitted of his charges. She was shot dead by Mohan Thomas's goons on the day of Bharatchandran's acquittal. Bharatchandran has a daughter aged ten who amusingly has her mother's name. Ironically, the Chief Minister himself is shown to be part of the dark side. IG Habib Basheer, who is like an elder brother to Bharatchandran, gets killed while trying to save him from the bullets of Kala Purohit's gang. The enraged-beyond-limits Bharatchandran confronts Hyderali for the final showdown, flanked by Anwar and Pookkoya and flaunting a captured Kala Purohit. The final scene is worlds different from its predecessor which shows Bharatchandran shooting numerous henchmen and torching an entire warehouse to kill Mohan Thomas. There is no unnecessary bloodshed here; after giving an empty revolver to Kala and asking him to shoot Hyderali, Bharatchandran kills Kala when he tries to shoot him instead. He soon places a bullet on Hyderali, before the very eyes of the scared-beyond-wits Chief Minister who is witness to the entire scene.

Chennabasappa wants to build a house for his family in Bangalore and desperately needs money. He decides to sell his plantation spread across several acres in his ancestral village to a soap company. The plantation has been looked after by Baswa for many years. Baswa is Chennabasappa's loyal servant. Upon knowing Chennabasappa's intentions, Baswa becomes agitated as he considers Chennabasappa's act to be something close to the rape of one's mother. In his view, the piece of land is like one's mother  that Chennabasappa sold for money. Chennabasappa is a rationalist, who is more like an atheist and doesn't believe on anything that's beyond sensory perception. He is a hard-headed fellow who is bossy at both office and home. As the story progresses, we see Uma behaving strangely. She would speak something of Chennabasappa's unspeakable and totally unknown dark past. During one such revelation, the family members come to know that Chennabasappa had seduced Baswa's wife while he was a teenager. Baswa's wife got pregnant and jumped into a well to save herself from taunts. Chennabasappa tries every medication and treatment that would bring Uma back to normal, but nothing works out. Unfortunately the family also becomes the target of several fake exorcists, who start milking them with their evasive talks but do no good to hapless Uma. In one such instance, the family is fooled by a Tantrik Puttachari , who actually tries to harness Uma's virginity to resurrect his own devil. However his plans fail when Nandish interrupts in between and saves Uma. Finally the family finds peace in the hands of a mighty but sane Tantrik Shashtri , who discovers the roots of evil in Chennabasappa's house itself, a spell cast lemon and an ugly voodoo doll. Shashtri orders the soul inside Uma's body to reveal its identity and we come to know that the unholy spirit was actually sent to Uma by a village Tantrik whom Baswa paid for this heinous act. Uma turns to normal after few days. A vengeful Nandish decides to go man to man with Baswa and reaches his ancestral village. He comes to know the Baswa died a few days back. Nandish begs a local Tantrik to help him out meet Baswa's spirit as he is all set to find answers to his questions.

In his quest to win Izabela, Wokulski begins frequenting theatres and aristocratic salons; and to help her financially distressed father, founds a company and sets the aristocrats up as shareholders in his business.http://www.imdb.com/SearchPlotWriters?Polish+Cinema+Database+http%3A//info.fuw.edu.pl/Filmy/ The indolence of these aristocrats, who secure with their pensions, are too lazy to undertake new business risks, frustrates Wokulski. His ability to make money is respected but his lack of family and social rank is condescended to. Because of his ""help""  to Izabela's impecunious but influential father, the girl becomes aware of his affection. In the end she consents to accept him, but without true devotion or love."

Forty-eight hours earlier, David Wyndham , the same team leader, is informed by his UN superior, Paxton  of a security breach involving another scientist on their project, David's friend and colleague Raja. Unauthorized access of the project's mainframe the night before was made using Raja's access codes. As a precaution he has been removed from the project; but David suspects a more sinister motive. Paxton holds a press conference about their project, codenamed ""EVE"" , which has provided most of Europe's energy for the past ten years beginning in 2010. The project utilizes three high-power particle colliders, located in Geneva, Barcelona, Spain, and Orleans, France. With the project's continuing success, Paxton is enthusiastic that the technology can be utilized worldwide. David, unhappily agreeing with Paxton's claims, confronts her afterward that she has no intention of sharing the technology with the Middle East, which she verifies. Outside the meeting hall David receives a mysterious phone call, then is approached by a reporter, whom he dismisses with a handshake. The reporter furtively copies David's fingerprint from his hand using a piece of tape and stores it in a case. A countdown appears on the screen, reading ""84 Hours to Extinction."" At home, David receives a visit from Raja , who has already surmised that Paxton's plans for the technology. Raja believes he is a scapegoat for the security breach because he is the only Arab with level 5 project clearance. When David rejects his claims, Raja angrily leaves. That night, the ""reporter"" that accosted David dons a lab coat and fake ID to sneak into the Orleans facility. After using a recording of David saying his name and the copied fingerprint to gain access to the lab, he enters a series of codes into the computer. When he is confronted by another employee he uses a silenced dart gun to kill the man. A short time later, after the mysterious man has escaped, the plant explodes, destroying Orleans and a quarter of France including Paris, killing between 20,000,000-30,000,000 people. As he tries to sort out what happened the next day, David meets with Raja again. Raja has been named the top suspect and is running from the police. He is also being watched by Paxton's men, which David learns from Paxton herself. She shows him photos of Raja apparently meeting with the mystery man, a known terrorist named Aziz Khaled. Though stunned by this revelation, David insists he be allowed to go to ground zero to investigate the explosion before judgments are made. Later that night, Raja, pursued by both Paxton's men and the French police, attempts to board a train before being cornered in an underground station. A sudden earthquake allows him to escape. Paxton, watching in her office, nearly cries when the worst hit area by the earthquake is the Middle East, specifically Bahrain, where thousands have perished due to the quake. The next day, Raja calls David near the French-Spanish border, revealing that because the earthquake happened one day after the blast and hit where the EVE grid was absent. He deduces that someone has discovered the Doomsday Equation, which is a set of codes for each collider that, if used, could destroy the world. David and his team travel to Orleans via helicopter but they crash, killing the pilot. They find evidence that a Higgs field has formed, confirming Raja's suspicions. Meanwhile, Raja's electric car runs out of power at the border, leaving him helpless. A few hours later he is abducted by Khaled. David's team, meanwhile, attempts to escape France in a Humvee sent to rescue them only to be caught in a meteor shower. To his horror the ""meteors"" are actually falling satellites, and his team barely escapes. Khaled takes Raja to the Barcelona facility. After murdering all the workers and ordering his men to get as far away as possible, he tries to force Raja into giving him the site's Doomsday Equation, believing the meltdown will not cause the end of the world, but Raja steadfastly refuses. After returning to Geneva, David is taken to the facility, where his family is already sheltered. He concludes that the surviving colliders are feeding the magnetic field, and asks Paxton to order a full system shutdown. After becoming tired of Raja's stubborn defiance, Khaled shoots him in the knee, but doesn't see him grabbing a pen. Raja stabs Khaled in the leg, stunning him. He then shoves the terrorist into the reactor's shaft and Khaled falls to his death. Raja returns to the computer and opens an instant message to Geneva, telling David his suspicions about the Doomsday Equation were right - and the only way to save the world is to increase the system's output and choke the field out of existence, otherwise it will expand into a black hole. Still believing Raja is a terrorist, Paxton cuts the connection and a tearful and distraught David has no choice but to carry out the system shutdown, knowing that this action will only seal the doom of the entire planet and everyone and everything on it. The system announces that the full shutdown will take twenty seconds. David joins his family at the window overlooking the reactor and solemnly assures his oblivious family that things will be okay now that he's fixed the problem. As soon as the system shutdown is complete, the Geneva facility melts down in an explosion exponentially larger than the Orleans disaster. Everything and everyone, including David, his family, the facility's staff, and Paxton, within hundreds of miles of Geneva are incinerated in an instant. A view from outer space shows shock waves from the blast radiating throughout the Earth's surface, a large fissure forming in Europe and cracks forming around the globe. Finally, the Earth's core is breached, and the planet explodes violently. Nothing survives. The film concludes with a shot of pieces of what was once Earth floating through space, followed by a blank screen reading simply, Extinction."

Zhang Wuji has been seriously injured by the Xuanming Elders and almost dies, but Zhang Sanfeng shows special care towards him and attempts to preserve his life. However, that incurs the jealousy of his senior Song Qingshu, who collaborates with Zhou Zhiruo of the Emei Sect to harm Zhang Wuji. One day, Zhang Wuji is bullied by Song and falls off a cliff together with Xiaozhao, a girl who helped him. They meet Huogong Toutuo by coincidence and Zhang recovers from his wounds completely, learning the powerful ""Nine Yang Skill"" in the process as well. Zhang discovers later that the Shaolin Sect is plotting with five other major sects to attack Bright Peak, headquarters of the Ming Cult, where Zhang's maternal grandfather, Yin Tianzheng is. Zhang ventures into a forbidden place on the peak and finds the ""Heaven and Earth Great Shift"" manual, mastering another powerful skill, and he helps the Ming Cult defeat the six sects. The cult members are grateful to Zhang and nominate him to be their leader. Zhang Wuji discovers that the conflict between the Ming Cult and the six sects was instigated by his godfather's sworn enemy, Cheng Kun, who has been hiding under a new identity in Shaolin all this while. At the same time, he also encounters Zhao Min, a Mongol princess, who is also an enemy of his cult. Zhao uses a special drug to poison the cult's members and Zhang Wuji confronts her to ask for the antidote. Zhao Min makes Zhang promise to help her do three things in exchange for the antidote. At the same time, Yin Tianzheng and the cult's members, who misbelieved that Shaolin was behind the poisoning, go to Shaolin Monastery for revenge but they are surprised to see corpses everywhere instead. In fact, Song Qingshu had actually betrayed the Wudang Sect and defected to the Mongol government. He is plotting with Zhao Min and her men to kill Zhang Sanfeng, but Zhang Wuji returns in time and saves his grandteacher. Zhang Wuji promises not to use his newly-mastered skills and still manages to defeat the Xuanming Elders.

Detective Jim Corrigan starts working on the case since he had a relationship with Brenner's daughter, Aimee, despite the Police Captain telling him its Lt. Brice's case. Jim goes to Flemming, the butler for Brenner, who shows him the footage of two men in ski masks entering the complex and setting up the bomb. Jim asks if Brenner had any enemies, and Flemming answers as many as anyone so wealthy, leading Jim to ask for names. Fleming tells Corrigan that several of Brenner's longtime collaborators were not included in his latest pictures and were very unhappy about it. That evening at a special effects warehouse, Drew Flynn is confronted by the late Foster Brenner, who accuses him of his murder. Flynn watches as Brenner transforms into the Spectre, who uses his powers to have the models and animatronic movie monsters attack Flynn. Flynn meets his end at the hands of a gigantic gorilla robot. Next on the hit list is Peter McCoy, who attempts to escape town with a suitcase full of money. However, the Spectre takes control of his car and forces it to crash. McCoy survives, only to watch his car reform and chase him down. Later, Aimee is putting on make-up when Jim arrives at her house undetected by phasing through the wall. She kisses him and suggests they run away together. Jim says that she is good enough to be an actor in her father's movies, revealing that he knows she gave the access codes to her father's estate to the two executives whom he had fired. He opens a nearby briefcase, which is revealed to be full of money. Aimee attempts to reason with Jim while rummaging for a revolver hidden in the desk, saying that he loves her and that they can be together, but Jim refuses. Aimee aims her gun at Jim, saying she could have given him the world. Jim answers, ""I left this world a long time ago."" Aimee fires multiple times, but the bullets pass right through Jim as he transforms into the Spectre. Aimee attempts to flee, but the Spectre surrounds her in a tornado of the money she has taken. The money surrounds her, cuts at her flesh and soon the money is now covered in her blood. The tornado dies down and Aimee is dead. Jim calmly walks away as the police arrive, walking through them, as they cannot see him. Jim says that it is his job to root out evil, that he is justice, that he is the Spectre."

Lieutenant Terrien , an inexperienced and naïve junior French Army officer, has volunteered for active service, rather than a safe staff post in Algiers. He is posted to Kabylie, a remote and mountainous region of Algeria, as a replacement for Lieutenant Constantin  who was killed during a ‘friendly fire’ incident commanding a counter-insurgency ambush operation – i.e. he was accidentally killed by his own side during a confused fire-fight. The war in Algeria is much more complicated than Lieutenant Terrien anticipated as he takes over command of his new platoon at the outpost ""Mazel"". Within hours of taking over his new command Terrien is ordered to lead a ‘locate and destroy’ mission into the zone interdite  to find a World War II French Army veteran named Slimane, now a local commander of Algerian rebels trying to win the independence of their homeland. Slimane is never seen in person during the film. When the Fellagha  massacre the population of a local village in retaliation for a patrol visit from Terrien’s platoon, on the assumption that the villagers may have collaborated with the French, Terrien vows to remain calm and professional despite the appalling horrors that greet him. Terrien saves a young boy from drowning in the village well and is gradually forced to see the conflict through the eyes of that child: a child who temporarily adopts the French soldiers almost as a surrogate family. The boy ultimately plays a major role in Terrien’s death towards the end of the film. Terrien’s determination to remain detached, professional and controlled despite the atrocities that occur around him, including the torture, abuse and summary execution of Algerian prisoners, quickly gains him the initial contempt of Sergeant Dougnac  his combat-hardened and cynical platoon sergeant, who has come to the conclusion that the level of violence employed by the Fellaghas can only be countered by equally brutal measures applied by the French. The blooding of the young Lieutenant and the way in which he reacts to his newfound knowledge and experience provides the dramatic arc of L’Ennemi intime. Terrien’s idealistic view of French involvement in Algeria is summed up during a conversation with Captain Berthaut , an intelligence officer, when Terrien argues that as metropolitan French citizens the Algerians should enjoy the same political rights as any other French citizen and states that “You can’t fight barbarism with barbarism”. Berthaut, identified as a former member of the French Resistance who was tortured by the Gestapo, a veteran of the French Indochina War and an old comrade-in-arms of Dougnac, disagrees and later in the film, states that, “At 110 volts the truth always comes out”. Berthaut is killed and mutilated during a Fellaghist ambush as he attempts to evacuate a wounded soldier out of the ‘Forbidden Zone’ by jeep. In view of such atrocities, Terrien slowly begins to change his view. Dougnac, identified within the film as a veteran of French Indochina, is a complicated character who is not averse to resorting to torture and barbarism when it comes to dealing with insurgents yet is capable, professional and increasingly privately respectful of Terrien as an officer and as a man. Their professional differences and the harsh realities of operations in the field, however, drive the two men to breaking point with Dougnac finding release through alcohol and at least one instance of self-inflicted torture. Such are the pressures on Dougnac that he finally snaps and deserts the army. Lost in an undeclared, and dirty, war, Terrien and Dougnac discover that their worst enemy is often themselves."

The pain of imminent separation from their only child has been beautifully portrayed by the characters played by Vijayaraghavan and Mini Nair. The boy who led a carefree life until now has been identified as having a deep understanding of religious philosophy and scriptures at a very young age by the priests of a holy shrine. They request the family to induct the boy into priesthood to which the grandfather of the boy readily agrees to; for, he himself had aspirations of joining the shrine in the past. The parents, though not keen on parting with their child are compelled to give in on the basis of the word given by the elders of the family.Desadanam  - IMDb

Wilson's plan code named Operation Mad Dog, is to ram a destroyer packed with tons of explosives into the outer gate of the dock, while his commandos cause havoc to the docks facilities and garrison and then detonate the explosive laden destroyer. Opposed to Wilson is Royal Navy Captain Owen Franklin, whose own son was killed on Wilson's disastrous last Dieppe Raid type raid on the French coast at Le Plagé. Under pressure from Winston Churchill, Wilson's plan is given the go ahead even though the naval craft requested for the mission are reduced to a minesweeper replacing the destroyer, no escort craft and only four motor launches. The mission's naval commander Lt. Commander Don Kimberly is blinded in a training accident while trying to save an injured commando, who dies from his injuries. With no other option Franklin is ordered to replace Kimberly, and thus put him in direct conflict with Wilson on the journey to France. As they cross the English Channel Wilson finds himself at odds with Franklin when the supporting air raid seems to be cancelled, but to Wilson's surprise Franklin ignores the order to return and changes his view of both Wilson and the mission. With a united group heading into the port, the Germans discover the approaching minesweeper and its commando carrying escort of motor launches. After briefly stalling the Germans the convoy is bombarded by the coastal batteries which line the port entrance, but fail to stop the minesweeper from ramming the dock gate. As the commandos storm ashore leaving Wilson on the minesweep's bridge it is hit once again, this time though Wilson is mortally wounded. In the port's facilities a running battle rages between the Germans and the commandos, leading to Franklin being captured and taken to the German HQ. Brought in front of the garrison commander, Colonel von Horst, Franklin is mocked for what the Germans see as a fruitless aim. Meanwhile a German party boards the minesweeper and heads for the smashed bridge where Wilson barely alive, notices that the detonating circuit is broken.

He is there on almost every scene and there are quite a few occasions when this diminutive man throws in some big surprises at us.The movie was a surprise hit at the box office due to its low cost and satellite revenues.

When a neighbor  interrupts and snaps him out of it, Eric cuts the conversation short and goes back inside, where his girlfriend  announces that she is tired of his obsession with Alien Abduction -- Eric is laboring on a thesis dismissing UFOs as a ""modern mythology"" -- and she breaks up with him. This tips Eric into a removed state of mind; as he focuses on her lips moving, everything fades to silence. Next we encounter Eric returning from a late-night jog. He falls asleep on the sofa and has a nightmare of alien abduction, climaxing with a vision of a strange creature carrying Lisa away. When Eric wakes the next day he finds Lisa missing but convinces himself everything is okay. Later, Eric meets ""Beth"", who introduces herself as Harold's  niece, and for most of the movie, we see Eric pulled into an investigation about what happened to Lisa, encouraged by Beth, who seems driven to convince Eric that aliens are real. We also meet Dr. Connell, a woman whom Eric refers to as his ""Professor"", but who seems to react to his contact with alarm and concern . While investigating with Beth, Eric encounters three people who seem to morph into strange creatures in a way that matches reports of ""shape shifting"" aliens. After narrowly escaping the first, Eric is ""forced"" to kill the next two: a UFO ""expert"" Beth convinces Eric to see, then Lisa's sister Cindy, who appears asking too many questions. Eventually, after becoming lovers, everything leads Eric and Beth back to ""The Tower"", an old, abandoned radio station on a hill outside town. Eric breaks into the Tower using a special alien ""key"" mysteriously delivered to him, and inside, finds two dead bodies: both people Eric himself killed. Confused and panicking, Eric then finds Harold, his strangely nosy neighbor, who confesses to following Eric and expresses concern for him, describing Eric's recent bizarre behavior and theorizing that Eric might be controlled by aliens. But when Eric notices that Beth -- told to wait back at the truck -- has vanished, Eric angers and knocks Harold unconscious, then tries calling Beth's cell phone. He then hears it ringing, but it is coming from inside the Tower. Fearing the worst, Eric goes back inside, follows the ringing to a spot right next to the dead bodies, pulls a tarp aside and finds Lisa's dead body, stabbed to death with a large knife next to the corpse. Flashback cuts suggest that it was Eric who did the killing, and finding Lisa's body knocks Eric into the same strange state of mind we saw earlier, with everything slowly fading away to silence as he heads back outside. Eric kneels by the injured Harold, still gripping the knife, and Harold desperately tries to convince Eric that the aliens are controlling him, asking repeatedly ""what they made him believe"" to control him. But Eric remains deaf to Harold's pleas and stabs him in the heart. While Eric carves a gaping wound in Harold's abdomen, then reaches in and removes an organ, another flashing montage of images reveals that at every key point of the past few days' adventure Eric shared with ""Beth"", he was in truth alone. The suggestion here is that ""Beth"" is the thing that Eric was ""made to believe"". Reinforcing this idea is the very next sequence, in which Eric hands off Harold's removed organ to an unseen force, eerily reminiscent of Eric's ""nightmare"" on the night it all began. The movie ends with Eric returning to the truck, where he finds Beth waiting, safe and sound. After one final moment of doubt -- when Beth suggests they visit ""Dr. Connell"", even though Eric distinctly remembers only referring to her as ""my professor"" -- Beth gazes seductively into his eyes, and Eric surrenders completely, starts the truck and drives off to visit  Dr. Connell, eliminating the last person connected to what has transpired."

Huzefa , is interrogating a captured man  suspected to be a Research and Analysis Wing  agent. The man offers up details about RAW's operations in Afghanistan in exchange for money and safe passage across the border. He betrays his colleague, Major Rajan , who has also infiltrated the camp. This is only a ruse, as both overpower their captors and fight their way out of the camp. Along the way, they rescue a girl called Farah . The man is actually a RAW agent and his nom-de-guerre is Agent Vinod. In New Delhi, Agent Vinod enters RAW headquarters to meet his boss Hassan Nawaz . Nawaz shows him Major Rajan's final message from Russia. Just as he completes his message, Rajan is killed by a man who has a scorpion tattoo on his forearm. Nawaz asks Vinod to find out what '242' is. Vinod travels to Moscow, and enters a nightclub owned by Abu Nazer . He manages to capture and interrogate Nazer, who tells him a man called Freddie Khambatta is to smuggle the million to Morocco. Vinod is almost captured by Nazer's men, but manages to escape, killing Nazer in the process. Vinod boards a flight to Marakkesh, Morocco. Freddie Khambatta turns out to be the flight steward. Vinod picks him up from the airport, only to assume his place. As Freddie, Vinod meets local mafia boss David Kazan , who is accompanied by his personal  doctor, Ruby Mendes . Kazan suspects Vinod, and gets Ruby to administer him a truth serum. Vinod blurts out that he is a RAW agent and killed Abu Nazer. Kazan confronts Vinod when he regains consciousness, but Vinod manages to convince him he is Freddie Khambatta, and explains he had to kill Abu Nazer to protect the mission. He manages to hack Kazan's phone and finds out that a MI6 agent is reaching Morocco the following day. In the meantime, Vinod gets closer to Ruby, and tries to find out what '242' is. Ruby is actually Iram, a British-Pakistani who is working undercover for the ISI. Vinod goes to meet the MI6 agent and finds him murdered in his room with strong pointers that the murder was committed by Ruby. He gets an invitation card from the murdered agent's room for a private auction. He learns that many international terrorist groups are converging at an antiques auction in Marakkesh to purchase '242'. Vinod brings Ruby to the auction, where Kazan is also present along with Jagadishwar Metla . Vinod spots an LTTE agent he had encountered previously, and from him, learns that '242' is actually the detonator for the nuclear device, disguised as an antique volume of Omar Khayyam's 'Rubaiyyat'. A bidding war ensues, and Kazan manages to secure the detonator. In Chaman, Baluchistan, the head of the ISI is murdered by Col. Huzefa, who is actually part of a group of rogue ISI colonels planning an attack on India. In Morocco, Kazan locks the detonator with a password, and hands it over to Colonel , who has arrived in Morocco. Iram runs into the real Freddie Khambatta, and finds out Vinod is a RAW agent. Managing to escape from men trying to kill them, both agree to work together to prevent the nuclear device from falling into the wrong hands. Ruby returns to Kazan's estate only to find it ransacked and Kazan shot dead by 'Colonel'. 'Colonel' captures Ruby and asks her to reveal the whereabouts of Agent Vinod. He plants a sniper next to the hotel where Agent Vinod is to rendezvous with Ruby. The sniper takes a shot at him but Vinod manages to escape and is admitted to a hospital. The assassin reaches the hospital in the guise of a doctor and tries to administer a venom injection to Vinod. Vinod spots the scorpion tattoo on the doctor's forearm and overpowers him, killing him. He then clears his way out of the hospital to find Iram. 'Colonel' who is now in possession of the detonator, has reached Latvia to acquire the bomb. He enlists Iram to seduce an airport security employee to get his ID card. Iram succeeds in doing so, and 'Colonel' provides the ID card to his man, who is to transport the bomb out of Latvia. Colonel also sets up a rigged bomb so that both the airport employee and Iram die in the blast. Vinod arrives and as he interrogates Iram, the blast occurs, giving Iram the realization that she was being set up by the Colonel. Vinod and Iram join hands and try to capture the Colonel and the bomb. Iram tells Vinod that the Colonel has called for a meeting at Karachi with fugitive don Pasha who can also be in the plot. The Colonel gets the Rubaiyat and tells his men to kill Vinod and Iram. However, Vinod manages to kill them all. Iram and Vinod reach Karachi, where they meet Farah, who is a dancer. With her help, they enter the wedding attended by an Indian mafia don . There, they learn that Col. Huzefa and the don have agreed to smuggle the nuclear device from Karachi into India via the sea route. However, they are captured by Col. Huzefa, from whom they learn the target of the bomb is New Delhi. They manage to escape, and make it to New Delhi, where they try to find the location of the bomb. They find that the Colonel is staying with an ISI/Lashkar agent, who is an old professor. Iram finds the professor's map, which is of the bus route that Jimmy is taking with the armed bomb. Iram hurries to the exhibition where Colonel is hiding as a pilot. Iram runs into 'Colonel', and is shot, but points him out to Indian security forces, who kill him. Eventually, Vinod tracks down the bomb and takes the bomb up in a helicopter to detonate it as far away from the city as possible. Iram realizes that David Kazan had set the password to the detonator and asks Vinod to try the name of Kazan's camel. The bomb is defused but Iram dies of gunshot wounds. Later Vinod sees a recording, showing Metla planning the attack. Vinod accuses Metla and the Zeus group for murdering millions for making money at the global stock exchanges and starting a nuclear war in sub-continent for geo-political reasons. Metla mocks Vinod, telling him world affairs are too complex for 'lowly police officers' to understand. However, Vinod is wearing a wire, and London cell of the Lashkar-e-Toiba are listening in. Realizing that they have been manipulated by Metla into almost starting a war with India, with the Pakistan government violently cracking down on them, the Lashkar sends a suicide bomber  to assassinate Metla at a function in his honor. Metla is killed, but posthumously feted as a great philanthropist. On a beach in Cape Town, the beautiful Russian girl who first acquired the nuclear device is seen sunbathing. She looks up to find Agent Vinod smiling at her. It is apparent Vinod has moved on to his next mission.

After interrogating some of King's followers, Milton discovers that the ritual will take place in Stillwater, a prison in Louisiana. He heads there, but stops by a diner, where he meets Piper , a waitress that is withholding sex from her boyfriend, Frank , so he will marry her. Milton's car is damaged, so he sabotages Piper's car and follows her to fix it in exchange for a ride to her home, which is on the way to Stillwater. There, Piper sees Frank having sex with another woman and they get into a fight, with Frank beating her up. Milton beats him up, knocks him out and steals the keys of his car, taking Piper along with him on a ride to Stillwater.

In her dilemma she crosses paths with the town mechanic's daughter 'Lizzie,' who has been gang-raped by a pack of youths; the scandal owing much to the repressive attitude adopted by much of the town . When Asta first arrives in the town, she sets foot in the local pub where many of the men treat her with little respect. Redirected to the town's mechanic, Asta stays with the mechanic's family  as a guest. The family, including Lizzie's father Tim, are visibly troubled and suffering from some sort of depressive situation. One night when Lizzie can not bear her parent's fighting anymore, she runs outside crying, where Asta  reaches out to her. This forms the beginning of their connection together. After experiences with The 'gang' of young men - who apart from collectively having raped several girls in the town and who behave with little respect - begin to increase in intensity of badness  Asta begins to speak more openly and energetically, in public and private, about the scandalous affairs which she has learned are occurring in this isolated town. Vociferously protesting the policeman's complacency and even ignorance of the situation, Asta begins to act as a role-model and even as a source of strength, to the violated and injusticed Lizzie, whose own father even struggles to deny the truth of what has happened under his very nose. Championed on by Asta, Little by little, Lizzie draws upon enough courage to begin both straying further from the safety of her own house, and confronting her own father about his denial. But even her own house becomes unsafe in the culmination of her perpetrator's provocation; Asta's firm resolve for justice - which has inspired not only Lizzie's father, but also her family and friends to face the truth - results in blind rage when the young men learn Asta and Lizzie means business; they are going the distance to press charges to get them imprisoned; and the men realize that their freedom to be blazenly reckless and get away with it , is under serious threat. This sets off the chain of events which results in tragedy.

Life is picture perfect &mdash; a doting girlfriend and a job where his expertise makes him the most-wanted photographer in the London fashion world! Armaan has learnt that his chronic insomnia is, however, not a function of any sleeping disorder. The truth is that he hears voices; voices that torture him; voices that are disturbing him. More importantly, voices that nobody else can hear! Life is less than picture perfect now! While his friends sympathize with his problems, his girlfriend Gehna is irritated with his weird behavior. Add to that her father Sinha  constantly berates him for his fondness for the bottle. No one seems to understand his predicament. What puzzles them is that he talks to himself… or, rather, he talks to people who no one can see simply because they don't live. Soon, Armaan becomes aware of his special ability to connect with the souls that haven't crossed over. Equipped with a will to fulfill the wishes of these spirits who hound him, Armaan sets out on a mission to help out two souls &mdash; an old man, Mr. Virender Kapoor , and a young woman, Carol .

When Armaan finds out, he sees her as a ghost, and once he pleads to God, Gehna comes back to life. The two then get married and, straight after the marriage, Armaan's problem of seeing/hearing ghosts is freed.

Marks asks if there are any plain-clothes policemen sat in the audience, to which the reply is negative. Then, whilst lighting up a joint, Marks asks ""who here is a marijuana smoker?"", to even greater applause. The film then diverts into Marks' internal monologue as he recounts his life. Born in the Welsh valleys in 1945, young Howard Marks  - nicknamed Mr. Nice - excels academically to much higher than the national standard of the United Kingdom. This remarkable aptitude earns him a scholarship to Oxford University at nineteen years old, reading philosophy and physics, but Mark's destiny changes forever one night when dutifully studying alone in his dorm. A beautiful, rebellious and hedonistic foreign exchange student from Latvia, Ilze Kadegis  - breaks into Marks' room, looking for a secret passageway within. Marks follows Kadegis through the secret passageway and into a forgotten storage space used by one of the school's top marijuana dealers, Graham Plinson . Kadegis seduces Marks, and introduces him to cannabis for the first time. For the next few years, Marks becomes an enthusiastic customer of Plinson's, and continues his love affairs with both Kadegis and cannabis; the group enjoy a series of wilder and wilder nights, with their academic lives suffering as a result. Circumstances change for the worse when Plinson introduces the group to LSD. When rich heir Joshua Macmillan, a friend of Marks', dies of overdose, and Marks impales his foot on a spike, Marks vows off ever touching drugs again - or at least the harder variety of drugs. The trio of Marks, Kadegis and Plinson promise to each other to turn over a new leaf, and they pass their scholarships through some intense last-minute revision, and a little cheating. They then all move onto teacher training jobs at the University of London in 1967, where Marks hastily marries Kadegis. Fractures begin appearing in the early stages of the marriage, with Marks becoming despondent, apathetic, and suspecting Kadegis of having an affair. What's more, Marks gets into trouble at the London University for ""having long hair and flashy suits"". When plans to bring a large cache of hashish into England via Germany go wrong with Plinson getting arrested, Marks steps in to help - figuring he has nothing left to lose anyway. Marks goes to Germany and drives the car with the stash inside across the borders himself, simply driving through customs. The customs officers are on the lookout for Plinson's crew, but do not know Marks, who sails through without incident. Marks says the thrill of getting away with it was like ""religious flash and an asexual orgasm"". When selling the hashish back in London to an Arab oil sheik named Saleem Malik , Marks makes a fortune, and swifty becomes addicted to this new but dangerous lifestyle as a big league marijuana trafficker - eventually running a large percentage of the world's cannabis. It is a path that will lead Marks face-to-face with terrorists, government agents, and lose him his freedom to one of the toughest prisons in the United States in 1988, through to the present day as a media personality and cult hero."

Heather Hepworth and Sheila Holden are Assistant Head and Deputy Head teachers respectively at the Calthorpe Special School.{{cite web}} the British schoolteachers visit several public schools in the vicinity, including one for children with mental disabilities. They discover that teaching styles are more direct in Pakistan, with an ‘I talk, you listen’ approach as opposed to ‘let us do it together’ that is used in the UK. One look at the children’s report cards, however, ascertains the effectiveness of this approach in the results that appear to be just as good. An emphasis on discipline surfaces as a common feature in all the individual opinions expressed, when inquired about the school visits. The documentary segregates the experiences of these teachers into two major categories. The first category can be characterized as the material artifacts such as ceramic wares, Ajrak – a special kind of blockprinted shawl that serves as a symbol, woodwork, and bangles that represent Sindh’s outer surface. This also includes rides on a Bullock cart, an Auto rikshaw, and the public bus which is world-famous for ornamental art on the outside as well as the inside. Rebecca Bailey volunteers to try everything from making and painting intricate pottery to taking a ride on a public bus that is crowded enough to burst at the seams. The second category can be characterized as general culture and the value system that exhibits the land’s deep-rooted core. Generosity - especially the manner in which gifts are exchanged, a sense of community found almost everywhere, the significance of keeping tradition alive, being one with nature, a fusion of both Hindu and Muslim religions – illustrated in the shrine at Dera Lal, marketplaces that never sleep are just some of the aspects highlighted upon by the British schoolteachers. There is greater substance in this film than just a cultural exchange. When Brummies Met Sindhis taps into the human being’s ability to connect with another human being, irrespective of race, creed, religion, profession, or location even.<ref namehttp://azfarrizvi.com/home/portfolio/when-brummies-met-sindhis/|titleazfarrizvi.com|accessdate=23 March 2010}}

The flasback sequence begins with Bonin inviting two hitchhikers for a ride in his Chevy van, charming them into his confidence. Once he has them in his power, he murders one young man and reveals an alliance with accomplice Vernon Butts . Soon, Bonin stalks Kyle Peterson , a timid teenager who works at a local shop. Initially planning to kill him, Bonin offers that they bond to take what they want. Bonin begins to harden him by getting him to boldly blow off a date with his girlfriend, Lisa. Bonin introduces him to Butts, and they show him their ""family album"" of murders. Taking him under his wing, Bonin ""trains"" Kyle to give in to his violent impulses, and eventually guides Kyle into committing his first murder. Unsatisfied, Bonin embarks on a hunt for more young men, taking Kyle with him. Later, Bonin visits his alcoholic mother  who is lonely after parting with Bonin's father, against whom she holds contempt. She also regrets abandoning Bonin, and tells him he should hate her. That night, Butts, who resents having been replaced by Kyle as Bonin's protegé, tells Kyle about Bonin's homosexual experiences in the U.S. Air Force. Butts states that Bonin has a sickness that makes him think he controls the world, which sends Bonin into a frenzy. Later that night, when Butts harms himself, Bonin reconnects with him. After Kyle sees this, he distances himself from the two of them. Bonin tries to contact Kyle, who won't answer his phone. The next day, Bonin kills two more victims on the freeway. He searches for more accomplices and soon recruits William Pugh ([[Thomas Curtis . This is short-lived after he kills another young victim and Pugh flees, horrified. Bonin looks for Pugh at his house only to discover from his father  that his name is actually Billy and he is in police custody for trying to steal a car. Bonin also learns that police are onto the freeway killer and spots a mysterious car observing him while listening to the news reports on the radio. He makes a stop at a newsstand to pick up the Orange County Register, and begins talking to an older man, whom he suspects to be a police officer. Bonin, frustrated, returns home and finds the same mysterious car is stalking his home. He tries to contact Butts, but he won’t pick up. Bonin accosts Kyle at night after work, and attempts to convince him to throw off police by committing ""one last murder"". Kyle refuses, however, and takes off with Lisa in his new car. While driving, Bonin becomes aware of a car following him, but still picks up a teenage hitchhiker. Bonin promptly has a nervous breakdown, frightening the hitchhiker into departing his vehicle, but Bonin stops him and strangles him with a tire iron and his victim's own t-shirt. Shortly after, a rescue team arrives on the scene to arrest Bonin. As he is taken into custody, he realizes that Detective St. John , whom he saw at the newsstand, was the one watching him after all. Officers also track down and arrest Kyle. In the interrogation room, Bonin admits to St. John that he committed most if the murders by himself, but that Butts was his accomplice for the later crimes; Butts is arrested, and hangs himself in jail. St. John then confronts Bonin with his psychiatric profile, which reveals that he had been neglected by his mother and molested by his grandfather. Reverting back to the outset of the film, Ruth suspects that Bonin is simply using her for company, and that he knows nothing about her son. Before she leaves, however, Bonin makes up a story about killing Ruth's son to protect Kyle, the actual murderer. Ruth vows to witness his death, and later attends his execution while carrying a picture of her son."

While there, his friend the Duchess of Richmond  introduces the married man to the pretty Lady Frances Webster , an ardent admirer, at a ball. During the course of the evening, however, Wellington receives an urgent message: Napoleon has escaped and has landed in France. French King Louis XVIII and his niece and most trusted adviser, Madame, the Duchess d'Angoulême , are not alarmed in the least. Ney , formerly one of Napoleon's marshals, volunteers to take 4000 picked men and capture his former leader. However, he switches sides. With France once again under Napoleon's control, both sides race to reassemble their armies. Napoleon routs the Prussians under Marshal Blücher  before coming to grips with his old nemesis Wellington at the Battle of Waterloo. At the crucial point of the battle, Blücher's timely arrival turns the tide, and Napoleon is defeated for the final time. The allies occupy France and gather in Paris to divide the spoils. Once again, Castelreagh sends Wellington to try to restrain the others from punishing France too severely, in order to ensure a lasting peace. Wellington's task is made more difficult by the opposition of Madame, who is certain he wants to rule France himself. Wellington warns Louis that Madame's desire to have the still popular Ney executed for treason would risk another revolution. Madame arranges for Wellington's recall to London, to answer a newspaper story that he is carrying on an affair with Lady Frances.

Marybeth returns to Reverend Zombie's shop, and after demanding to speak with him, he reluctantly lets her in.

They are both unhappy with their married lives and missing the old days when they were single. Realizing this, their wives talk to their friend Dr. Lucy  and decide to give them a ""Hall Pass"": A week off from marriage during which they can have sex with other women. They are skeptical at first, but ultimately accept the offers and try to pick up women with their friends Gary , Flats  and Hog Head . Maggie and Grace spend Rick's and Fred's ""Hall Pass Week"" at Maggie's parents' house in Cape Cod, where Grace flirts with athlete Gerry . She says that if their husbands have Hall Passes, so should they. With their wives and children away, Fred and Rick check in at a motel and prepare for their Hall Pass Week. On day one, they decide to eat before going to a local bar and get too tired to spend the night there, preferring to stay at the hotel. On day two, they eat pot brownies and decide to play golf, but get too high and wreak havoc on the golf course. On day three, Rick and Fred go to a bar with their friends but fail to impress the women there. They decide to get drunk in order to become more loose, but go too far and wind up getting into a fight with other customers. They spend day four at the hotel suffering from a hangover. On day five, Rick goes to a local coffee shop where Rick flirts with an attractive waitress named Leigh , much to the annoyance of her co-worker Brent who insults Rick. When Rick answers him back, Leigh is impressed and tells Rick that they might see each other at the local gym. They later meet there, and Leigh invites Rick for a beer after they work out. Rick decides to sit in the hot tub instead, but falls asleep and stays there for several hours ending up with his muscles too weak to use and forced to accept the help of two naked men to leave much to his dismay. Meanwhile, Grace and Gerry get closer, while Maggie finds herself attracted to Gerry's coach. On day six, Rick and Fred go to a bar called Enter the Dragon with their friend Coakley , where Rick meets his children's babysitter Paige , who has just turned 21 and is with her aunt Meg. Paige is attracted to Rick, but he shoots her down to dance with Leigh. Brent, the party's DJ, is angry at this. After the party is over, Rick goes to party at Coakley's while Fred takes a girl to his motel room. However, she feels sick and, after a minor incident in the bathroom, is sent back home by Fred before they can have sex. Later that evening Paige's aunt shows up at the room and mistakes Fred for Rick, eventually seducing him. Fred fakes oral sex on Meg until they are interrupted by Rick. Meanwhile, Gerry's coach tries to seduce Maggie, but she rebuffs him. Grace, on the other hand, has sex with Gerry, but tells him it will be just that one time. On her way back home, she feels guilty about cheating on Fred and has a car accident. At Coakley's house, Rick meets Leigh who offers him a one-time fling. He initially wants to do it, but ultimately rebuffs her, unable to cheat on Maggie. As he is leaving after hearing of Grace's accident, he is approached by Brent who is angry at Rick for going out with Leigh. She calms him, and Rick makes his way to the hotel where he finds Paige who thinks he was having sex with Meg. They enter the room and find Fred having fake sex with her. After finding out the truth, Meg kicks Fred in the face. Upon hearing about Grace's accident, Fred tries to go to the hospital but finds Brent vandalizing what Brent thought was Rick's car. Upon seeing Paige's aunt, his mother, at the hotel, Brent thinks Fred has had sex with her and tries to kill him as well, but runs out of bullets and is tackled by Paige and his mother. Rick and Fred enter Fred's car and make their way to the hospital with Brent and the police chasing them. At the hospital, Brent is arrested for attacking them and Fred finds out Grace only broke her nose. Rick goes back home and finds Maggie. He tells her he did not use the Hall Pass and remembers the time he lost his virginity to her. She is the only woman he has ever been with. Moved by his declaration, Maggie tells him she did not use her Hall Pass either and they reconcile and have sex for the first time in months. Fred and Grace also reconcile and decide to hide their cheating from one another. However, Fred ultimately confesses that he used his Hall Pass with Paige's aunt when Grace asks him to take her to see Kathy Griffin. During the credits, Fred hosts a barbecue where he pays Kathy Griffin to be present.

When Bella admits that she and Edward plan to consummate their marriage during their honeymoon, Jacob becomes angry but is held back by his pack. He then runs off into the woods, and Edward takes an upset Bella back to the reception. The couple spends their honeymoon on the Cullens' private Brazilian island. Although hesitant, Edward has sex with Bella for the first time. After, Edward realizes that he bruised Bella's arm, back and shoulders during sex and he vows to never be intimate with her again, much to her disappointment; he later gives in to her seductions. Two weeks into their honeymoon, Bella discovers that she is pregnant with a baby growing at an extraordinarily accelerated rate. After consulting with Carlisle, they rush back to Forks. Bella refuses to consider having an abortion, and enlists Rosalie's help to protect her wishes. Opposed to Sam Uley's plans to kill Bella and her child, which is thought to be a demon, Jacob angrily leaves his pack and arrives at the Cullens' to protect Bella; Seth and Leah Clearwater join him, forming a new wolf pack. As the pregnancy progresses, Bella's health severely deteriorates. As a last resort, she begins drinking blood, which satisfies the fetus' vampiric thirst and allows her to regain some strength. Soon afterward, Bella goes into a painful labor and gives birth to her child, Renesmee, an conflation of the names of Bella's mother, Renée and Edward's adoptive mother, Esme. To save her life, Edward injects Bella's heart with his venom to transform her into a vampire, but nothing seems to happen and Bella is thought to be dead. Greatly distraught, Jacob attempts to kill the baby, but stops when he realizes he has imprinted on the child. When the werewolves learn of Bella's ""death"", they attack the Cullens' house in an attempt to kill the baby. They are forced to stop after learning Jacob has imprinted on Renesmee . After Bella is thought to be deceased, Carlisle notices there's a slight pulse and tells Edward and the rest of the Cullens as they clean the body. Soon after, her wounds suddenly heal as the venom spreads through her body. Bella's heart finally ceases, and she awakens as a newborn vampire. In a post-credits scene, the Volturi hear about Bella's conversion; Aro notes that it does not end their dispute with the Cullens, proclaiming, ""They have something I want""."

Marcus is accustomed to performing fake exorcisms on ""possessed"" individuals, but when he reads of an autistic child being killed during an exorcism, he comes to realize the potential danger of exorcism. He agrees to take part in a documentary designed to expose exorcism as a fraud, working with a film crew consisting of producer/director Iris Reisen  and cameraman Daniel Moskowitz . At random, he chooses an exorcism request sent by farmer Louis Sweetzer , who claims his daughter Nell  is slaughtering his animals while she is possessed. The team drives to the rural area of Louisiana where the Sweetzers live. After listening to the details of the case, Marcus claims Nell is possessed by a powerful demon named Abalam. Prior to the exorcism, Marcus plants hidden speakers and electronic props, so he can bamboozle the family into believing he is driving out a demon. After the ritual, Marcus and his film crew leave, believing they have cured her of a mental state that was misdiagnosed as a possession. That night, Nell mysteriously appears in Marcus' motel room, apparently unwell. Marcus takes Nell to the hospital for tests, which conclude that Nell is in perfect physical condition. Marcus goes to see Louis' former pastor, Joseph Manley, and asks him questions regarding Nell and Louis. Manley informs Marcus that he has not had contact with the Sweetzers for a long time. In the morning, Louis takes Nell home, but chains her to her bed after she slices her brother Caleb's  face with a knife. While Louis takes Caleb to the hospital, Marcus and the camera crew further investigate Nell and the home. They release Nell from her chains. That night there is a disturbance in the house, and Marcus and the crew hear the cries of a baby. They find Nell standing in a hallway. When they try to confront her, she goes into a bathroom, where she is found submerging a baby doll in water. After she comes out of her trance, the crew finds a drawing of a dead and bloodied cat. That night Nell steals their camera and goes into her father's barn where she corners a cat, beating it to death with the camera. She returns to the house and raises the camera over Marcus's head. The rest of the crew stops her, unaware of what has transpired. They discover two more paintings of Nell's. The first depicts someone who appears to be Cotton standing before a large flame, holding up a crucifix. The second shows what appears to be the dead bodies of all three visitors to the Sweetzer farm: Cotton being consumed by the flame he battled in the other picture, Iris hacked to pieces with an axe, and Dan decapitated. Louis comes home and hears an answering machine message from the hospital stating that Nell is pregnant. Marcus accuses Louis of incest, which he denies, insisting that Nell is a virgin and has been defiled by the demon possessing her. Tempers flare as Marcus insists that Nell needs psychotherapy instead of another exorcism. Louis orders the crew to vacate his property. While contemplating whether they should take Nell, they hear noises upstairs. They discover that Nell has climbed atop her dresser. As they try to calm her, she slashes Marcus's hand with a knife and runs outside. The crew decides to leave; as they enter their van, they see Nell sitting on the porch. As Marcus approaches Nell, she tackles him. The struggle leads inside as Louis chases them with a shotgun. In order to keep Louis from killing Nell, Marcus agrees to attempt another exorcism. Marcus confronts the entity that has possessed Nell, which introduces itself as Abalam, the same demon Marcus had spoken to Louis about. Abalam agrees to release Nell from the possession but only if Marcus can remain silent for ten seconds. Abalam begins breaking Nell's fingers as it counts out loud. After counting to three and breaking three of her fingers Marcus yells for Abalam to stop. Abalam then asks Marcus if he wants a ""blowing job."" Marcus realizes that a demon would know the actual name of the sex act and concludes that Nell is actually a very disturbed girl pretending to be possessed. Nell then tells them of Logan, the boy who supposedly impregnated her. Marcus arranges for Pastor Manley to come to the house to provide solace to the Sweetzers as Marcus prepares to leave. On their way home, Marcus and the film crew detour to the coffee shop where Logan works. Logan tells the crew that the only contact he had with Nell was a brief conversation six months ago at a party that was held at Pastor Manley's home. Logan admits that he is gay and, therefore, did not have sex with her. Marcus and the film crew leave the cafe and begin to drive out of town. They begin to question Nell's story, and Marcus realizes that Pastor Manley was lying about having not seen Nell for two years. Marcus turns the van around and returns to the Sweetzer farmhouse. They enter the house to find numerous occult and countercultural symbols scrawled on the walls, but Nell and Louis are missing. Marcus and the film crew wander into the woods, where they see a large fire and a congregation of hooded cultists led by Pastor Manley. Louis is bound and gagged on a pole while hooded figures pray around an altar, atop which Nell is bound. Marcus and the film crew watch as Nell gives birth to an inhuman child. Manley throws it into the fire, which causes the fire to grow rapidly while demonic roars emanate from within. At that moment, Marcus' faith is resolved as he grabs his cross and rushes towards the fire in a frenzied attempt to combat the evil. Iris and Daniel are discovered and run away. Iris is tackled by a member of the congregation, who kills her with an axe. Daniel tries to escape through the woods, but when he pauses to catch his breath, Caleb appears and decapitates him. The camera collapses to the ground, and, after a few seconds of stillness and silence, the credits roll."

He falls in love with Marjorie Waddell, a young woman ten years his junior. However, he is under constant pressure to enlist, especially from Waddall's father. He has the opportunity to do so when the British Army forms the 1st Australian Tunnelling Company to supplement the Royal Engineers; Woodward is commissioned to lead the unit. On the Western Front, Woodward meets Frank Tiffin, a young Australian soldier who is suffering from shell shock; it is later revealed that Tiffin, being underaged, was initially relegated to being a stretcher bearer, where he saw firsthand the horrors of war. Woodward reassigns Tom Dwyer and Norman Morris to relieve Tiffin. Two German tunnelers break through into the tunnel. Morris and Dwyer dispatch both of them, but Dwyer is killed when a German explosive goes off, burying the tunnel on top of them; Morris is rescued by the other sappers. Later, Woodward is tasked to destroy the Red House, a fortified German position raining enfilade fire down upon the frontmost section of the British trenches. Although Woodward initially proposed tunneling beneath the Red House, his commanding officer, Colonel Wilson Rutledge, insisted that it be done by dawn. Along with Sgt. Bill Fraser and Morris, Woodward crosses No Man's Land. They manage to reach the Red House and plant explosives underneath it. However, as they make their way back to British lines, they discover that their fuse is too short, so Morris runs ahead to retrieve the exploder. While they wait, they discover mortally wounded Lt. Robert Clayton, who had been ordered to cut a gap in the wire for them. Morris arrives with the exploder and they destroy the Red House. The next day, after a game of rugby, Woodward receives word that they are to be moved up the lines to the Belgium front. Upon arrival, Tiffin, Youngston, and Bacon are separated from the rest of the battalion and pinned down by German machine gun fire. Bacon, being the fastest runner, volunteers to distract the Germans while the others make a run for British lines. Although Tiffin and Youngston make it, Bacon is killed mere inches from safety. The unit continues on to Hill 60. During an inspection, it is revealed that British forces had been tunneling deep below the Messine Ridge for months, planting a million pounds of ammonium nitrate in the form of 21 massive mines. Woodward is tasked with maintaining the tunnels as the British military buildup begins; they hope to fill the ridge with as many German troops as possible. To this end, he constructs a massive shaft to keep the water table from inundating the explosives. He also digs multiple diversion tunnels to throw the Germans off. Sneddon is buried in one such tunnel when he is ordered into it by Rutledge, despite reporting that the Germans would likely be setting off explosives soon. The Germans eventually catch on to their plan and dig toward the main tunnel. An attack tunnel is dug in response, and the Australians successfully destroy the exploratory shaft with minutes to spare. However, the charge that was used weakens the clay and a portion of the tunnel collapses, trapping Tiffin. His compatriots race to stall the detonation of the mines, but the schedule could not be delayed on account of one man. Woodward sets off the mines to begin the Battle of Messines.

Rakesh and his friends get together every Friday for a party. In this party, they invite idiots to ridicule them behind the scenes and calling them ""talent"". They enjoy doing it so much that they don't even mind missing out on family appointments. One of Rakesh's friends  meets Krishnanunni , an Income Tax Inspector , on a bus trip and decides that he could probably be a source of entertainment for Rakesh. Rakesh promptly calls Krishnanunni and invites him for dinner. Krishnanunni is a talkative self promoting singer  who carries with him a photo album showcasing his musical life. He is excited at the prospect of meeting a music producer which might help advance his career as a singer. Krishnanunni is kind-hearted and wants to help everyone but he also has the ability to mess things up for people around him. He can be annoying to the person who is sitting next to him but he makes it a funny experience for everyone else watching him. Friday arrives but Rakesh accidentally falls into a swimming pool and gets injured . His back is sprained badly and is restricted from moving around. Rakesh knows that he will not be able to make it to the party but still decides to meet Krishnanunni to see how good or rather bad he is. Before Krishnanunni arrives at Rakesh's residence, Rakesh's wife leaves after an altercation with Rakesh. When Rakesh asks Krishnanunni to call his family doctor, he accidentally calls Rakesh's girlfriend. Rakesh asks Krishnanunni to leave his home for all the mess he has created. Rakesh tries to get information regarding his wife's whereabout. Krishnanunni offers to help and calls Rakesh's wife's previous boyfriend Sarath  under a false identity. Instead, he ends up giving Rakesh's Landline number that makes it obvious to Sarath that Rakesh is trying to get all details. Sarath tells Rakesh that his wife might have gone to a party hosted by a sex-freak. It turns out that a colleague of Krishnanunni, played by Jagathy, an Income Tax Inspector Grade 1 , knows the whereabouts of this person. Jagathy is a eccentric character who loves to watch cricket and is an ardent fan of Sachin Tendulkar. While trying to mend the relationship between Rakesh and his wife, she tells Krishnanunni that he was called by Rakesh to make a fool of him and have fun at his expense. This hurts Krishnanunni, but the good-hearted Krishnanunni still wants to help Rakesh by letting her know how sorry Rakesh is because of his acts and how much he loves her. Krishnanunni does so by calling Rakesh's wife, who had been involved in a car accident after leaving the apartment for the second time , and makes no mistakes in this conversation, as well as making up near perfect excuses on the spot and with no prompting. After encouraging Rakesh's wife to return home, Krishnanunni makes yet another mistake after he picks up the telephone when she calls to talk to Brochant despite having previously told her he was in a phone booth."

The commander of the cavalry patrol is dictating a report to his clerk in the office of the fort's commander. Held prisoner in the former commander's office is the Arapahoe war chief, Hanu, who led the raid. He will say very little. And all the searchers can find is a single grave and a Colt pistol left behind by a gunman Hanu remembers as a ""quiet, lonely man..."" After finding the Arapahoes starving, a wandering gunman named Chuka  gives them the last of his food. ""For the Children"", he says. His gift impresses Hanu. Later, Chuka encounters a stagecoach with Mexican passengers Senora Veronica Kleitz  and her niece Senorita Helena Chavez . The Arapahoes arrive, led by Hanu. Everyone is prepared for death, but Hanu recognizes Chuka and simply rides on. Later, Chuka finds himself stranded in an isolated U.S. Army fort with the coach and passengers. The fort's second-in-comomand. Major Benson, asks the stage driver about the ""saddle tramp"" hanging around the stable and is told not to let him hear Benson calling him that, warning him: ""That, Major, is a hired gun. He's called Chuka and he is fast. Awful fast."" The fort's commander, Colonel Stuart Valois , is worried that the Arapahoes may have ambushed his overdue patrol and refuses to allow the civilians to leave. He sends out his scout Lou Trent  to reconnoiter, but his horse returns without him. Meanwhile, it is revealed that nearly everyone in the fort has a past they would rather forget. Before he became a hired gunman, Chuka was in love with Kleitz, but because he was only a lowly hired hand on her wealthy father's ranch, he was beaten and run off and she dutifully married a man selected by her father from their own social class. The soldiers are the dregs of the army. Valois was cashiered from the British Army for suspected cowardice for being drunk when his command was attacked. His second in command, Major Benson  is a card cheat, while Lieutenant Daly was acquitted of the charge of treason. Only Sergeant Otto Hansbach  is a first-rate soldier; he had served with then British Captain Valois in the Sudan and owes his life to Valois. Hansbach tells Chuka that when Hansbach was a young soldier under Valois's command in the Sudan he blundered and was captured by the enemy. Valois's and his unit raided the enemy camp and rescued Hansbach from horrible torture and certain death. But Valois himself is captured by the enemy during this raid and is left behind when his unit is forced to withdraw during the enemy's counter-attack. Valois is horribly tortured by the enemy and it is implied that they castrated him during the torturing. Valois's unit eventually rescues him but he is scarred physically and psychologically by the events. Hansbach tells Chuka because of this he will always serve under Valois's command and never question his courage. Chuka tries to renew the relationship with Kleitz, now a widow, but she tells him it is too late. He offers to take the two women to safety, but by the time Kleitz asks him to save her niece, the fort is under siege. Chuka agrees  to sneak out and scout the enemy for Valois; in the process, he rescues Trent. Chuka then pleads with Valois to abandon the fort, since Hanu , the Arapahoe leader, only wants the food supplies in the fort, but Valois is determined to find out if he really is a coward or not, even though he is hopelessly outnumbered.

The film flashes back to the end of the Easter Rising in 1916, as Collins , Harry Boland , Éamon de Valera , and other survivors surrender to the British Army. As the Dublin Metropolitan Police's ""G"" Division identifies the leaders, Collins tells Boland that next time, ""We won't play by their rules, Harry. We'll invent our own."" All the other leaders die by firing squad, but de Valera, an American citizen, is imprisoned in Britain. Collins, Boland, and the others are sent to Frongoch internment camp. After his release, Collins runs for a seat in the First Dáil. While giving a speech, the rally is attacked by the Royal Irish Constabulary. Collins is severely beaten, but is rescued by Boland. While recovering on a friend's farm, they meet Kitty, who begins a romance with Boland. Collins is tipped off by Detective Ned Broy  that the British plan to arrest de Valera and his Cabinet. However, de Valera forbids anyone to go into hiding, stating that the ensuing public outcry will force their immediate release. Only Collins and Boland escape arrest and imprisonment, and there are no protests. Left in command, Collins orders the IRA to begin raiding police barracks for weapons. He also issues a statement that all collaboration with the British will be punished by death. Collins then recruits a squad from the IRA's Dublin Brigade, which, on Bloody Sunday, assassinates fourteen members of MI5's Cairo Gang. In retaliation, the Black and Tans fire into the crowd at a Gaelic football match at Croke Park. Broy is caught burning documents and killed. Later, Boland and Collins travel to Britain and break de Valera out of Lincoln prison. Angry that Collins has overshadowed him, de Valera announces that he will travel to the United States to seek recognition from Woodrow Wilson, and orders Boland to accompany him. Before they depart, Collins informs Boland that de Valera fears leaving them alone together. After returning, de Valera decrees that the IRA must attack The Custom House. Collins argues that fighting conventionally will allow the British to win, but the Irish Cabinet votes to support de Valera. The attack fails catastrophically, leaving six men dead and seventy captured. In the aftermath, Collins declares that the IRA can only hold out for a month. In private, he tells Boland that the IRA will be lucky to hold out for another week. To his shock, however, the British soon call for a cease fire. Collins is ordered to London to participate in negotiations with the British, despite objecting that he is not a diplomat. After the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in December 1921, de Valera erupts upon learning that the terms have been published without his agreement. Collins argues that the Treaty gives them the freedom to achieve the Republic. De Valera and his supporters resign in protest after the Dáil approves the Treaty by 64-57. Both Collins and de Valera try to sway the Irish people in their respective directions. Collins is attacked by an anti-Treaty Republican during a rally, but escapes. In the aftermath, he asks Kitty Kiernan to marry him and she accepts. When the people vote to approve the Treaty, de Valera refuses to accept the results and orders the IRA to seize the Four Courts in Dublin. Ordered by the Cabinet to retake the Four Courts, Collins is appalled at having to fight former comrades. Arthur Griffith, however, informs him that, if the Irish Free State Army will not deal with the IRA, the British Army will. In the subsequent Battle of Dublin, the IRA is driven from the city. Despite Collins' attempts to capture him, Boland is shot by a sentry while trying to swim the Liffey. Devastated by Boland's death, Collins travels to County Cork. He reaches out to de Valera through an intermediary, asking for a peace conference. Without de Valera's knowledge, the intermediary informs Collins that de Valera will meet him at Béal na Bláth the following day. As a convoy of Irish Army vehicles approaches, IRA men open fire from a nearby hillside. Collins is shot and killed. Kitty is informed of his death just after trying on her wedding gown. Completing his story, O'Reilly tells Kitty that Collins would not want her to mourn as long as she has. The film ends with a montage of footage from Collins' funeral. A eulogy states that, although a career soldier, Collins died in a failed effort to remove the gun from Irish politics."

This enrages Dr. Khurana and he orders assistant Dr. Budhkar  to complete the surgery. After the surgery, Smita writes a remark on the patient's file which gets her into trouble with the hospital administration, including the dean, Dr. Desai. Meanwhile, Dr. Khurana is shown getting drunk and misbehaving at his party and cheating on his wife with his muse Maya. After Smita discusses the case at a gynaecology conference, Dr. Khurana, using his influence with the administration, has her removed from service. Smita immediately files a request for an inquiry into why she is dismissed, threatening to go to court and involve the media if it is not complied with. The hospital and Dr. Khurana institute a committee that they believe will give a decision in their favour. Prior to the hearing, Dr. Khurana tries to coerce Dr. Budhkar, one of the witnesses, by making lucrative offers. On the first two days, the hearings proceed as per Dr. Khurana's plans, however, on the third day, Dr. Budhkar returns as a witness and recounts his earlier testimony, giving a true account to honor his friendship with Smita. Shortly after, Dr. Suren produces Dr. Deshpande, who used to work with Dr. Khurana in Mumbai and had been rusticated for uncovering Dr. Khurana's role in forced surgeries and the kidney racket. It is implied that the hearings end in Smita's favor, and Dr. Khurana is shown at home in distress.

Noreen, a waitress, Lonnie, a cop, Jimmy, the owner, Billy and Starr, a couple on their way to elope, John, a salesman, and Hank, a quiet man. The radio is turned on and tells of four family members murdered gruesomely a county over. Noreen is shocked, wondering how someone could kill children. She talks to John, who reveals his wife died two years ago. Then she goes back to the counter and talks to Lonnie and Hank, complaining about her lazy husband. The cop flirtatiously offers to run away with her, but is rebuffed. A man in a black leather jacket comes in and sits. When his order of steak is denied, he gets angry, and Jimmy yells at him to leave if he doesn't like it. Noreen not so stealthily gets Lonnie to the back, and suggests the man could be the killer. The cop does not believe her, and the man approaches them to ask for more coffee. Noreen spills it betraying her nervousness, and Hank asks Lonnie to check out the man. Questioned, the man is antagonistic, belittles Lonnie and just wants to be left alone. Angry, Lonnie pulls a gun and demands answers, asking if he drives a black truck, but Hank confirms the man drives a red truck. Lonnie regrets his actions and apologizes, and explains. The man pays and leaves. Hank smokes in the bathroom, and Noreen and John talk. But the man comes back with a shotgun and kills Lonnie and Jimmy. He points it Noreen's face, but doesn't shoot after Noreen begs him not to. The man assembles the five remaining characters and demands their wallets, keys and cellphones. Noreen tries to keep one, but gets caught. Hank is ordered to drag Lonnie's body out. He doesn't want to, but does after being threatened. Afterwards, he says there are likely only 8 bullets in his handgun and 7 shells in his shotgun, and Hank wants everyone to rush him, but John is too scared. Greene comes in, and the man threatens him, but Greene stays cool and flippant, asking him if he finished the job, and gives him a suitcase of money. He tries to leave, but the man won't let him, saying he's not Smith. Greene is handcuffed to a chair, and the man asks about Smith and the money, but Greene doesn't want to answer, so the man beats him. When the shotgun is aimed at his crotch, Greene comes clean: he's a businessman who was buying up land to build a shopping mall. But one man wouldn't sell, worried about his partner wanting his money, he hired Smith to persuade the holdout. Smith killed the man, his wife, and his kids, the deaths on the radio. With no heirs, Greene could buy the land from the bank. After this, the man kills him. The man now suggests that one of them is Smith, and wants to know who. John volunteers to talk, but the man wants to talk to Hank first. He beats Hank, and sits him down without handcuffs. John plans with Noreen to get the gun away. Hank reveals he's an exsoldier and claims he's married, but the man shows him his wallet with a condom inside. Hank doesn't want to talk about it, so he's shot in the leg. In pain, he admits he has sex with men at truckstops, and claims he's Smith if he'll stop shooting, but the man kills him. Noreen asks him why he's doing this, but he says he just came in to get something to eat and 'just snapped'. John  after threatened, admits to be Smith and turns back the questioning, revealing the man is an ex-military man who was booted on psychological issues. The situation is now reversed, the man bargaining with John, who refuses to let the man go without all the money. The man panics, kills the couple, shoots John, and when he goes for the kill, Noreen comes from behind and cuts his throat. John asks Noreen for the key, but Noreen pulls the handgun, not trusting him. John taunts her, saying she doesn't have the guts and she's out of bullets. But Noreen, good at counting, knows and proves she has one left, and kills John.

The President of France orders the case be considered of utmost urgency by the National Police, only for it to be handed down to the bumbling Inspector Léonce Caponi. Adèle Blanc-Sec, a journalist and travel writer of some fame, finds herself involved after returning from Egypt, where she was searching for Ramesses II's mummified doctor. She wants to revive the mummy with the help of Espérandieu so the doctor can save her sister Agathe, who is comatose following an unfortunate tennis incident involving a hatpin. After a brief struggle with her arch nemesis, the mysterious Professor Dieuleveut, she retrieves the mummy and returns home. Her mission is complicated further by Esperandiue being on death row, having been blamed for the pterosaur's attacks in lieu of Inspector Caponi and celebrity big game hunter Justin de Saint-Hubert having any success in taking down the beast itself. The mummy ends up being the Pharaoh's Nuclear physicist  and is unable to help her sister medically. He does, however, accompany Adèle to the Musée du Louvre, where they revive the rest of the Pharaoh's mummified court on display there, including the Pharaoh himself. The Pharaoh's doctor uses their advanced medical techniques to revive Agathe. The Pharaoh then decides he wants to see Paris, so the entire court wanders out into the night, scaring the ever-hapless Choupard yet again. Adèle decides she needs a vacation to relax. The final scene shows her boarding a ship, only to be annoyed by some boisterous children. Professor Dieuleveut appears, as the viewpoint pulls back the name of the ship is revealed, the RMS Titanic."

Six months ago, she and her parents moved from San Francisco to a smaller town due to her father Neil's claim the city was too dangerous following a burglary. Gail, a high spirited romantic, initially started dating classmate E.K. Miller, but he broke off their relationship because Gail was unwilling to sleep with him. Now, Gail is dating Steve Pastorinis, despite her overprotective mother's objections. After a while, she receives an anonymous letter which says: I am watching you.

However, when the gorier notes and phone calls keep coming, Gail decides to warn her principal, who informs her it could be the act of her current or former boyfriend.

Armaan does not turn up for three months, and his employer makes the difficult decision to sack him, but he asks his boss to listen to why he could not come. Getting soft, his employer allows him to drive to Pune where he has a meeting. Armaan starts the story from here. In Armaan's village, many problems include a rising drought situation and financial difficulties due to the antics of his twin brother, who has a bad reputation for debt addiction and theft. In the opening, a man named Arif demands 500 rupees from Armaan. Eventually, Muskaan pays the debt to Arif and Armaan's brother is arrested, later on released. To solve the drought problem, he goes to a government office to build a well, with a friend. There, he goes through stages such as explaining what he wants and even having his photo taken. Muskaan, on the other hand falls, in love with a man called Arif, of which Armaan does not approve at first but later is pleased with. Armaan does not receive the well he wanted and sits in despair. He and Muskaan try to tell the police inspector about the well that was 'stolen', but the inspector finds the story rather silly and is even stubborn enough to not listen to what they have to say. Disturbed, Armaan and Muskaan launch a protest with several villagers against the police inspector, later on to the justice minister, where the minister punishes the inspector for his slack behaviour. The inspector, realising his mistakes and behaviour, then starts to approach the people in a more orthodox way. The justice minister then allows the government people to build the well for the villagers and punishes them all for not doing what they are supposed to do. With the drought problem solved, Armaan decides that Muskaan should marry an Arab sheikh. Muskaan does not accept her father's offer and even has an argument about this. The issue is even more heated when she receives a letter from her friend, Sakina, which involved her getting beat up by her sheikh husband and getting kicked out, shocking Armaan and Sakina's mother. Disturbed, Armaan then decides that Muskaan should marry Arif, much to her delight. With the two of Armaan's problems solved, he ends his story at an awards ceremony, which in his perspective was a 'big drama', as the stage literally collapsed, delighting people.

While vacationing with his artiste friend, Raja in Kashmir he meets a beautiful girl named Sunita and falls head over heels in love with her. Sunita was a great singer and had also got a contract to sing on Radio, she tells Vikram and also asked him to sing with her but he continuously denied her. Soon he proposes marriage to her, and she accepts. They go to the temple where they had first laid eyes on each other and seek God blessings as well as vow to never part till death, even tying the symbol of their love, a necklace vicky had won for Sunita in a fair, around a wishing pole. Vikram goes back to Delhi, to ask his mother's permission and blessings to marry Sunita, but she refuses telling VIcky about Sunita's parents and past. Also saying that if her name is joined to theirs, their business will suffer as Sunita's presence is inauspicious. His mother's words anger Vikram and he goes back to Kashmir and tells Sunita they will have a quiet temple wedding. On their way to the temple their vehicle meets with an accident against a truck. While Raja sustains minor injuries, Vikram is badly hurt and hospitalized, and Sunita's face is severely disfigured. Mrs. Sharda goes to see Sunita and offers her money to stay away from Vikram. She tells Sunita about her disfigurement and emotionally blackmails her by saying ""think how Vikram would live with an ugly and disfigured girl like her. Hearing this Sunita agrees to stay away from Vikram but says she doesn't want Sharda's money. Sunita is transferred to a hospital in Delhi, where Sunita's local doctor, Dr. Sahni together with a doctor in the Delhi hospital, Dr. Mehra restore her disfigurement by plastic surgery. On the day that she leaves, Vikram regains consciousness and asks for Sunita, But his mother tells him that Sunita is dead. Months pass and Vikram longs for Sunita, not eating properly, not living his life, not looking after himself. Meanwhile in these months Dr Mehra is doing his job beautifully, he fixes Sunita's disfigured face and gives her a new face. She quickly recovers, and cannot wait to give the good news to Vikram. Tho she believes that with her new face Vikram won't be able to recognise her, but Dr. Mehra, who now sees Sunita as his daughter, reassures her that in love one's face is no matter, the heart and the soul remains the same and that is what brings two lovers together, not their face or outer beauty. Sunita and Dr. Mehra turn up to Vikram's house only to find out that she is getting engaged to another beautiful, but wealthy young woman named Rita. Vikram is unable to recognise Sunita and she believes that he has forgotten her. She returns home with her new father  and decides to change her name to Kusum Mehra, to begin life anew. After the engagement party it is reviled that Vikram is making an orphanage in the memory of Sunita in Kashmir. It will be called ""Srimati Sunita Rai Bahadur Anathalay"" which means Mrs. Sunita Rai Bahadur orphanage, hence giving Sunita the proper respect of his name as she would have been had she been alive. Upon being asked by Raja why he agreed to marry Rita he tells of how his mother advertised it in the newspaper without even asking him and how when he confronted her she told him about the millions of rupees they would get through the marriage in order to fund and re-establish their failing business. Vikram decides that he will fund his Orphanage with his own funds and does not wish to let his mother's money play any role in its building or running. To earn money he decides to sing in stage performances as Sunita used to always ask him to sing with her. On one such performance Sunita aka Kusum and Dr. Mehra come to the show not knowing that Vikram is the artist performing. Kusum hears him singing a song dedicated to love but feels insulted that someone who has forgetting his love would sing a song for love. So she begins to sing against him despite promising herself that she would never sing again. Hearing her voice reminds Vikram of Sunita's voice and he continuously re-listens to her voice's recordings in order to figure out whether it is Sunita's or not. The next day he arrives at Kusum's house and asks her to sing with him on stage. She refuses. He offers her money to sing with him, again she refuses and angrily tells him to leave the house. Assuring her that he will return in the evening in case she has changed her mind, she leaves. As he had promised he returns in the evening, Dr. Mehra meets hims and asks why he wants Kusum's voice only, but before Vicky could reply the servant comes and tells then that Kusum is not at home. Vikram leaves once again. Dr. Mehra gets angry with Kusum and asks her why she is doing what she is doing. Why would she not confront Vikram and why still is she looking after him through the window. The next day when Kusum leaves the house Vikram is waiting outside in the car for her. He gives her a lift and on the way once again they are faced with a similar situation to accident that had taken away Sunita's identity. She screams and loses consciousness... A few days later when Vikram goes to see how Kusum is, he find out that Kusum had previously gone through a similar accident as the day when she had fainted. Kusum also asks about an injury on Vikram's forehead, one that he had received during his accident. Vikram tells her about his accident and about how he has forgotten everything. This angers Kusum further as she believes that Vikram has forgotten her and she accidentally spills every detail she knows about the accident itself. Some time later Vikram's mother finds out that he wants to do a show with some girl called Kusum and he won't marry until the is done. Therefore Sharda goes to Kusum's house and asks her to sing with Vicky and also telling her everything about how she had lied to Vicky about Sunita's death and why Vikram had decided to marry Rita. Kusum is happy to hear that Vicky has not forgotten her and that he still loves her and is making an orphanage in her memory. She is satisfied with this, agrees to sing with Vikram and will not get in the way of Vikram and Rita's wedding. Dr. Mehra calls Sharda to his hospital and explains to her how he had given Sunita a new face after her disfigurement. He tells her how Sunita is Kusum and Kusum is Sunita and how Kusum is satisfied only by the fact that Vikram stills loves her. Mehra tells Sharda there is still time, she can still reunite the two lovers. Sharda doesn't listen to him. Kusum sings with vikram and also reminds him of Sunita by doing the dance which both used to do while singing their song Yeh Vaada Raha. All of her things, her dance, her voice, everything reminds Vikram of Sunita and at the end of the performance her he holds her and calls her Sunita at which Kusum runs away. back home she packs her bags and leaves for Kashmir asking her father not to tell Vikram anything. Vikram comes seeking Sunita and confronts Mehra. Mehra tells him to ask his mother for answers. Vicky goes to Sharda and asks her whether Kusum is Sunita. His mother tells Vikram everything about how she lied to him about Sunita being dead because she wanted to protect him and make his future better, etc. Vikram goes to Kashmir to find Sunita and he does right outside her house. When she sees him she runs to the temple where they made their vows. At the temple they repeat their vows again and embrace each other."

Four years have passed and Michael is being ordained to the diaconate at the seminary. After ordination he writes a letter of resignation to his superior, Father Matthew, citing a lack of faith. Father Matthew , apparently wanting to talk Michael out of his decision, attempts to catch up to Michael on the street. He trips as he walks over a curb, causing a cyclist to swerve into the path of an oncoming van. The young female cyclist, Sandra , is critically injured and after seeing his clerical garb believes Michael to be a priest and asks him for absolution. Initially hesitant but unable to refuse, Michael comforts her and performs a blessing ritual thereby leading her to believe that he absolved her sins, even though he didn't have the power to do so. Seeing how calmly he handled the situation, Father Matthew tells Michael that he is called to be a priest despite his resignation. He later approaches Michael with an invitation to travel to Rome in order to attend a class on exorcism, taught by his friend Father Xavier  . Michael reluctantly accepts after being told by Father Matthew that a $100,000 student loan will be levied if his immediate resignation stands but that if Michael attends the exorcism class and still desires to resign afterwards then they will discuss matters . During classes, he meets a young woman, Angelina , who is also taking the course. He soon learns that she is a reporter who has been asked to cover the course for an article in a newspaper. Father Xavier, realizing Michael is a skeptic and is very tentative in his faith, asks Michael to see a friend of his, Father Lucas , who is a renowned Welsh Jesuit exorcist. Michael agrees and meets Father Lucas at his home, where he sees one of the priest's patients: a pregnant sixteen-year-old girl, Rosaria. It is later revealed that she was raped by her father, which led to her possession. However, Michael remains skeptical, even after witnessing several preternatural events, such as the girl coughing up three long nails and fluently speaking English. She pointedly reminds Michael of the last patient he embalmed and of his loathing for his father. He later speaks with Angelina again, who asks him to relay the information that he gets from Father Lucas to her, as she has tried to get an interview with him many times but has been refused. Michael declines. Meanwhile, Rosaria's condition worsens, highlighted by when she tried to drown herself, prompting Father Lucas and Michael to have her taken to a hospital for further care. There, Father Lucas performs another exorcism on the girl while Michael observes. They leave the hospital room together with Michael while Father Lucas stays overnight outside the girl's room. Late that night, she miscarries; the baby dies from cardiac arrest and the mother from blood loss from major hemorrhaging. Disheartened, Father Lucas feels he has failed her. After Michael sees this he decides to confer with Angelina. After the death of the young woman, Father Lucas begins behaving strangely, exhibiting signs of demonic possession. Michael and Angelina later find him sitting outside of his house in the rain. Father Lucas takes them into his house and, knowing himself to be possessed, tells Michael that he needs to find Father Xavier in order to perform the exorcism. Angelina and Michael try desperately to contact and find Father Xavier; however, they learn that he is out of contact for three days. Learning this, Michael decides to perform the exorcism on his own, with Angelina present. After constant rebuking by the demon and a long, drawn out fight, Michael regains his once lost faith and is able to force the demon to reveal its name, which is Baal. He completes the exorcism, and the powerful demon leaves Father Lucas. Successful, Michael leaves Rome, returning to the United States and to his life.

Communist party in those days was facing strong restrictions from government for its anti-state activities. Shivan had always been a headache for his mother, for his rebellious nature. But Lakshmi, the daughter of Krishnan Kutty Menon was in love with him, which was opposed bitterly by Menon. Shivan, slowly got involved with Communist movement and in short time became their political goonda. Shivan gets involved in several petty crimes and thus invites more anger from his uncle Menon. Karthy, a lady party worker with strong naxalite leanings develops a strong passion towards Shivan, but he is unaware of it.

Shekharan , the party leader identifies the potential of Shivan and decides to use it maximum for his own personal benefit. Unknowing the shroud tactics by Shekharan, Shivan gets involved in several crimes, one after another. One day, Karthy, in order to separate Lakshmi from Shivan, fabricates a story about her relation with him. She succeeds in making Lakshmi believe about her illicit affair with Shivan. Thinking that Shivan was just double dating her, Lakshmi informs police about Shivan's hideout and he is arrested and sentenced for a couple of years. This incident changes Shivan completely. He turns into a hardcore criminal, and develops a hatred towards Lakshmi. In a couple of years, the political scene in the state changes. Communist Party wins power, and Shivan is released from jail. He is appointed as the secretary of temple Devaswom, and Lakshmi is now an IAS officer, who is now holding the post of Devaswom administrator under Shivan. He tries maximum to belittle her. Shivan, a complete corrupt person, now tries the maximum to loot the temple. The temple staff under Sreekanta Poduval  tries to protest, but ends in vain.

Lakshmi tries to convince Vasu, but he expresses loyalty to Shivan, his close friend, without knowing his corrupt ways or political ambitions. Vasu, with in this time fall for the daughter of Parameshwaran Namboothiri , the head priest of the temple. But she avoids him completely. Vasu, a lower caste by birth, has no chance to win her, who is already engaged to Chitran Namboothiri . Under the instruction of Shekharan, Shivan steals the holy ornaments of the deity and accuses the head priest of stealing it. Vasu, who was on duty that night gives a false statement in the court accusing him. Parameshwaran Namboothiri commits suicide, which gives Vasu a mental shock. He, completely broken by this incident resigns from the job. The persuasion by Shivan was not well enough to block him, instead he even accuses Shivan for the death of Namboothiri. On way back, Vasu also indulges in a war of words with Lakshmi, who tries to abuse Shivan for his crimes. Vasu, under emotion reveals that it was Lakshmi's attitude that had made Shivan a complete criminal. He also asks her to meet Karthy, who is in jail, to know the truth about Shivan. In jail, Karthy reveals her that she had nothing with Shivan, and it was just a fabricated story to fool Lakshmi. Lakshmi, under strong remorse apologizes to Shivan, who now is no mood to listen to her. Shekharan understands the danger, if Vasu reveals the truth about the stolen ornaments in court. He tries to convince Vasu, but fails in doing so. He even threatens to go to police to reveal the truth. To protect himself, Shekharan kills Vasu and dumps his body in the river. Shivan, knowing the death of Vasu, is broken down and in a range attacks Shekharan in the party office. He is jailed by Shekharan and is framed in a false case of killing Vasu. In jail, Shivan undergoes serious mental changes. He transforms completely and adopts spirituality as a remorse for the crimes committed. Upon release, he leaves to North India and undertakes sansyas and adopts the name Swami Amritananda. After long years, now he is back in Kerala. Shekharan, within time has emerged as a strong figure in politics and is the mastermind behind the communal riots. He, plans to finish off Swamiji.

However, Pinu always gets into trouble at school waiting for Rimzim to give him the shoes. Meanwhile, Pinu's father, desperate for money, borrows some gardening equipment and heads off with Pinu to the rich suburbs of the town to find some gardening work. They try many mansions until a mansion belonging to a 6-year old girl and her grandmother agree. While Pinu plays with the 6-year old girl, his father works. They make a lot of money and decide to work at the mansion. One day rimzim see a girl wearing her lost shoes at her school and she follow the girl . She takes pinu to their house to show the place and they find out that family is more poor than them. One day Rimzim is attracted to a new shiny pair of shoes that the same poor girl is wearing. She asks her about what she did with her previous pair of shoes and when she learns that the girl had thrown away her old pair of shoes, she is greatly disappointed. Meanwhile, Pinu comes to know of the Interschool Marathon where one of the prizes is a pair of shoes. Pinu enters the marathon race in the hope of receiving the third prize of a new pair of sneakers , which he could exchange for girl sneakers and give to Rimzim. He accidentally wins the race and is placed first. He is shocked and cries on the podium as he watches in despair at the new pair of sneakers being awarded to the third placed runner. The film ends with Rimzim finding out that she will not get a new pair of shoes, but there is a quick shot of their father's bicycle at the end of the movie that shows what appears to be red shoes with red trimming for Rimzim and another pair of white basketball shoes, presumably for Pinu, whose old shoes were torn from so much use.

Boy and the others are happy to see Alamein return but Rocky is displeased at their father's sudden reappearance. It seems at first that Alamein is here to finally be in his sons' lives but it is soon revealed that he is actually back to find a bag of money he had buried before being arrested by the police. With his two henchmen, he begins to dig up the money in a nearby field he had buried it at but has trouble remembering the exact spot. Boy sees this and offers to help and Alamein soon decides to hang out with Boy and be a father.

However, upon arriving at Hotel Adlon, Martin realizes his briefcase was left at the airport. He takes a taxicab driven by a woman named Gina, but on the way to the airport, the cab crashes off a bridge into the river. Martin is knocked unconscious upon impact, but Gina saves him from drowning before fleeing from the scene to avoid the police, since she is an illegal immigrant from Bosnia. On Thanksgiving day, Martin regains consciousness at the hospital after being in a coma for four days. Martin returns to his hotel, only to discover another man with his wife, who claims she doesn't know him. He attempts to contact his old colleague Prof. Rodney Cole, who is unavailable due to Thanksgiving in the U.S. Martin then heads to the office of Prof. Leo Bressler, whom he is scheduled to meet that day. However, he sees the impostor, ""Martin B,"" already in a meeting with Bressler. As Martin attempts to prove his identity, Martin B shows him his ID and family photo – both of which have Martin's name, only with his face replaced by that of the impostor. Disillusioned by the identity crisis, Martin falls unconscious and finds himself back at the hospital. Smith, an assassin sent to target him, kills Nurse Gretchen Erfurt, but Martin escapes. He then seeks help from Nurse Erfurt's friend, private investigator and former Stasi agent Ernst Jürgen. Martin's only clues are his notebook and Gina, who works at a diner after being fired from the taxicab company since the incident. While Martin attempts to persuade Gina into helping him clear up his identity problem, Jürgen digs up information related to Martin and the biotechnology summit. He discovers that the summit is to be attended by Prince Shada of Saudi Arabia, who is funding a secret project headed by Bressler. Prince Shada has survived numerous assassination attempts from extremists in his own country, and Jürgen suspects that Martin's identity theft may be another attempt at taking the Prince's life. Meanwhile, Smith and another assassin, Jones, attempt to eliminate Martin and Gina, but the couple escape after a fight at her apartment, in which Gina kills Smith, and a car chase. Martin looks at his notebook and sees a set of numbers written by his spouse. The numbers correspond to words found on specific pages of the notebook, which appear as secret codes. Using the schedule written on the notebook, Martin confronts Liz, who tells him that he left his briefcase at the airport. Meanwhile, Jürgen receives Cole at his office, and discovers that both Cole and Martin are members of a secret squad of mercenaries known as ""Section 15."" Realizing Cole is there to kill him, Jürgen commits suicide by drinking cyanide-laced coffee in order to protect Martin. After retrieving his briefcase, Martin parts ways with Gina. She sees him kidnapped by Cole and Jones, and steals a taxicab and chases after Cole's van. Martin wakes up in a car park and is told by Cole that Martin Harris is a cover name, and that he, Liz and Martin B are assassins sent to target the summit. Because he injured his head during the car crash, his memory was altered and he believed that his fake Martin Harris persona was his own identity. Gina rushes in and stops Jones from killing Martin as Cole hides in his van. There is a brief fight between Jones and Gina that ends when Gina drives her car into Jones and squashes him against Cole's van. Gina drives her car into the van and sends it plummeting out the car park with Cole still inside, killing him in the process. Martin discovers a hidden compartment in his briefcase and finds two Canadian passports, realizing he and Liz were in Berlin three months prior to plant a bomb in the suite that is to be occupied later by Prince Shada for the summit. Having become aware of his own role in the assassination plot, Martin seeks to redeem himself by thwarting the assassination and heads for the hotel with Gina in tow. They are immediately arrested by security, but Martin convinces them of his presence in the hotel three months back. He then realizes that Prince Shada is not the target, but Bressler, who has developed a genetically modified breed of corn that is capable of surviving any climate, easing the world's food supply problem. With Bressler's death and the theft of his research, billions of dollars would fall into the wrong hands. Liz uses her own copy of the notebook's secret codes to remotely access Bressler's laptop and steal the data. After being convinced there is a bomb, security evacuates the hotel. Seeing that their assassination attempt has been foiled, Liz tries to disarm the bomb, but cannot reach the disarmament button and is killed as a section of the Adlon is blown up. Martin kills Martin B, the last remaining assassin, before he could murder Bressler. Bressler later announces his project to the world, which will be displayed to public for free, while Martin and Gina board a train with new passports, adopting new identities."

In the cage is a present from Krushchev to Caroline Kennedy, a puppy named Pushok. He finds the other Kennedy pets and tells them his story. Three years earlier, in Moscow, a strange man showed up, who was catching street dogs and taking them away. Once he tried to catch a dog named Strelka, but she ran away with her friend, the rat Venya. Then, Strelka went to go dig for bones and Venya went to a pay telephone to get some money. Meanwhile, while Strelka was running from the strange man, at a local circus there was a bad situation at the circus: Vova, a pig, became too fat to fly on a rocket, and Belka, a dog, flew instead of him. But Belka lost control of the rocket and flew away from the circus. After some time she crashed onto the pay phone where Venya the Rat was looking for coins. The crash broke the phone and Venya got all the money from the broken phone. After the crash Belka, Strelka and Venya were met by three other street dogs: a bulldog named Bula, a pug named Mula and a mutt named Pirate. Belka and Strelka ran from the other street dogs but the next morning all three of them were caught by the strange man. After being caught the dogs are put on a train to Baikonur where they ended up at a Soviet space program training center. There they met their trainer, Kazbek, who had to choose the two best dogs from the group. A month before launch date the chosen group was Bula and Mula, but on the final training day Venya came in first, with Belka and Strelka in 2nd and 3rd place. Belka and Strelka needed to fly with Venya, because he was first and the flight group was chosen. At the end of their flight, Strelka wanted to stay in space, because her mother had said that her father, Sirius, is living among the stars. Kazbek shows up having stowed away on their flight, and tried to convince Strelka to turn around. They saw a formation of objects flying towards them, believing them to be Space Dogs but they turned out to be meteorites, they got hit by a meteorite shower and the rocket caught fire from the damage. Strelka, Venya and Kazbek went to the back of the rocket rocket to fight the fire with their feeding formula as water, Belka was afraid but still jumped through the fire ring in to the driver's seat to turn the rocket back towards Earth. Strelka extinguished the fire, and Kazbek confessed his love for Belka. The dogs look at various constellations and Strelka salutes Sirius in lieu of her father. The dog flight crew makes it back to Earth alive. Strelka, Belka and Venya receive a heroes welcome, and it is discovered that Kazbek stowed away on the flight, but the Scientist in charge of the project tells him that Soviet Propaganda won't allow the world to know that a stow-away had been on the flight. The other Kennedy pets, lead by the cat, don't believe Pushok's story, except one French dog who sees the Cosmonaut Patch on Pushok's cushion. She then asks him to tell her what happened afterwards. Strelka returns to live with her mother. Venya holds conferences, telling his story to any willing to listen to him.

Victor goes off to ask her a question when he finds her unconscious. Victor then calls for Travis's help. Travis walks in nonchalantly, and just stares at the couple, which reveals him to be not so innocent. Victor soon passes out from being drugged by the beer Travis gave him.

Dow and Davey take the money to town, where they are presumed to have robbed the train. Davey is shot, wounded and taken to the Swenson farm to recover. Matt explains what happened and is made welcome by Helga Swenson and her father. The townspeople regret the shooting of Davey, whose limp will be permanent. Matt accepts a job as sheriff, trying to redeem himself for a shady past. He also begins to court Helga. Outlaws led by a man named Morgan rob the town's bank. One recognizes Matt, which makes the townsfolk worry that he might be in on this. Matt sets out to capture one of the robbers, but Davey, now a deputy, fails to stop another thief from being lynched. And Helga's father is also accidentally killed. A posse is formed, but after a hard ride, Matt and Davey are the only ones left. Bodies of most of the thieves are found dead with Comanche arrows in them. Davey double-crosses Matt, confessing that he was in on the robbery all along. A wounded Matt tries to make it across a river and the money drifts away. Davey and Morgan discuss how to get it back.

After meeting her in London he is sure they are being followed both in the street and at the railway cafe where they have a cup of tea. Once they are on the train he still can't rid himself of his unease as they sit discussing their new life together. Once she is asleep, North goes out into the corridor to try and gather his thoughts and it is then he again sees the man he believes has been following them. In a fit of panic, North pulls the communication cord and jumps off the train. By chance the train is stopped just a couple of minutes away from his house. When he gets there he finds his wife, Carol, waiting for him as usual, as though nothing were wrong. Feeling a burst of fresh affection for her, he embraces her. As they are embracing the sound of a massive train crash reaches the house. Carol immediately runs to help the victims, while John stands their stunned as he realises it is the train he has just left that has been involved in the disaster. After they run down to help North walks amidst the chaos and from a shattered carriage he catches sight of a lifeless arm sticking out of the wreckage that clearly belongs to his lover Susan Wilding. She and everybody else in the carriage has been killed in the collision. North chooses to say nothing about his presence on the train to his wife, maintaining that he returned from London by road. Over the next few days North is guilt-ridden as the details of the crash emerge. After the train stopped when he pulled the cord, it was struck by a goods train. There are dozens dead and injured and bodies are still being dug out from the wreckage. North's problems increase with the appearance of Clayton, an idiosyncratic British Railways crash inspector, who begins to ask questions that clearly unnerve North. North denies any connection with anyone on the train, although Clayton has recovered documents connecting North and his mistress which were found on the man who had been following them, a private detective hired by her husband, who had also died in the crash. Unable any longer to keep the pretence up, North admits to his wife that he was on the train and pulled the cord and that he was running away with another woman. In spite of his confession she decides to stand by him as his renewed love for her is clear. He then steels himself to confess to Clayton, only to hear on the radio that the crash had been caused by a failed signal rather than his pulling the cord. In spite of this they still go to Clayton who admits that he won't make anything more of North's actions as ""he doesn't want any more lives to be lost in the wreckage"". North and his wife go home, apparently to hear no more about the case. The next day, however, Clayton returns with Inspector Waterson who has orders to bring North in for questioning. Before the train crash, it has now been discovered, Mrs Wilding was shot through the heart. Waterson insists that North killed her and then jumped off the train, but North refuses to confess to this. After making his statement he is free to go, but with a cloud now hanging over him and the prospect of being hanged for murder. Now even his wife is losing faith in his innocence, and when the police uncover a revolver in the garden, it seems he is ceirtain to be hanged. North goes on the run from the police, visiting the Wilding house in London, and trying to discover if Mr Wilding is still alive, as he is listed amongst the railway crash dead. Wilding's mother insists to him that she has identified her son's body. He then travels down to the hotel in Plymouth where he had planned to stay with his mistress, and finds another person there under North's assumed name. It turns out to be Mr Wilding, who had been on the train and murdered his wife, and then made off. The two men confront each other and Wilding shoots North between the eyes. North comes to, back on the train, having just stepped out into the corridor. Instead of jumping off, North quietly returns to Susan Wilding. This time it is she who pulls the cord, sensing that his heart is not really in their affair anymore, and tells him to go back to his wife. He returns to his wife, and they embrace. He hears the sound of whistles on the track and fears another collision, but it is just the train moving off again after the delay."

She is befriended by a travelling samurai Toma Fujihira, who told her that he rescued her from bandits . They travel to a town run by the Shirakawa, a Yakuza family. They are plagued by the Banki-to, a group of mercenaries. This group is led by Banki, an evil man who is excellent in sword fighting but who has a deformed face. Ichi is befriended by Kotaro, a boy who lives with his drunkard father. After helping Toma win money from Chō-han, they are followed by five Bankito who threaten to take their money. After Toma refuses, he was challenged to a fight but he is unable to draw his sword. Ichi slays the gang. The Shirakawa leader's son, Toraji, assumes that it was Toma who slew the men and makes him his personal bodyguard. Ichi is convinced by Kotaro and his father to stay in the hope of Zatoichi passing through. Toma confesses that although has fighting skills he is unable to draw his sword because of guilt for blinding his mother in an accident. The Bankito plan their revenge. They kill the head of the Shirakawa. Toma is unable to defend anyone and is left unconscious. Ichi admits that it was her who killed the earlier men and after displaying her skills, the second-in-command is convinced and takes her to the mountains to meet their leader, Banki. After slaying two members who doubted her skills, Banki attacked and injured her, while stating that he has met her father. She was thrown into a locked ditch and left to die. We were able to see Ichi's backstory. Ichi was born blind. As an infant, Zatoichi rescued her and left her in the care of a group of {{nihongo}}, visiting her and secretly teaching her the techniques Zatoichi had mastered. Ichi grew up to be a musically talented and beautiful woman. After one of her goze group's performances, she was raped by one of the patrons. She was later exiled by the {{nihongo}}, even if it broke the other members' hearts as it is forbidden for a goze to have lovers or marry. She pleaded to the man who had raped her to talk to the leader of the goze so she can go back to the group, but he mocked her instead and tried to attack her again but she was able to draw her sword which is hidden in her cane and killed him. Ichi then travelled Japan to look for her father instead. Toma was attacked by the members of the Yakuza clan because of his deceit, but Toraji told him that they still need his help to defeat the Bankito. He went with Kotaro's reformed father to their hideout and was able to save Ichi. Banki swore revenge. While recovering, Ichi explained the reason why she's searching for Zatoichi. She wanted to see him one last time before she commits suicide. Toma as able to convince her to go on living. Later, while she slept, Toma left her to go help the Shirakawa fight the Bankito.

Gomez's lawyer Tully Alford  owes money to loan shark Abigail Craven , and notices that her son Gordon  closely resembles Fester. Tully proposes that Gordon pose as Fester to infiltrate the Addams household and find the hidden vault where they keep their vast riches. Tully and his wife Margaret  attend a séance at the Addams home led by Grandmama  in which the family tries to contact Fester's spirit. Gordon arrives, posing as Fester, while Abigail poses as psychiatrist Dr. Pinder-Schloss and tells the family that Fester had been lost in the Bermuda Triangle for the past 25 years. Gomez, overjoyed to have Fester back, takes him to the family vault to view home movies from their childhood. Gordon learns the reason for the brothers' falling-out: Gomez was jealous of Fester's success with women, and wooed the conjoined twins Flora and Fauna Amore away from him out of envy. Gomez starts to suspect that ""Fester"" is an impostor when he is unable to recall important details about their past. Gordon attempts to return to the vault, but is unable to get past a booby trap. Gomez's wife Morticia  reminds ""Fester"" of the importance of family amongst the Addamses and of their vengeance against those who cross them. Fearing that the family is getting wise to their con, Abigail  convinces Gomez that his suspicions are due to displacement. Gordon grows closer to the Addams family, particularly the children Wednesday  and Pugsley , whom he helps to prepare a swordplay sequence for a school play. The Addamses throw a large party with their extended family and friends to celebrate Fester's return, during which Abigail plans to break into the vault. Wednesday overhears Abigail and Gordon discussing their scheme, and escapes them by hiding in the family cemetery. Tully learns that Fester, as the eldest brother, is the executor of the Addams estate and therefore technically owns the entire property. With the help of the Addamses' neighbor Judge George Womack , who Gomez has repeatedly angered by hitting golf balls at his house, Tully procures a restraining order against the family banning them from the estate. Gomez attempts to fight the order in court, but Judge Womack rules against him out of spite. While Abigail, Gordon, and Tully try repeatedly and unsuccessfully to get past the booby trap blocking access to the vault, the Addams family is forced to move into a motel and find jobs. Morticia tries at being a preschool teacher, Wednesday and Pugsley sell toxic lemonade, and Thing—the family's animate disembodied hand—becomes a courier. Gomez, despondent, sinks into depression and lethargy. Morticia returns to the Addams home to confront Fester and is captured by Abigail and Tully, who torture her in an attempt to learn how to access the vault. Thing observes this and informs Gomez, who gathers the family and rushes to Morticia's rescue. Abigail threatens Morticia's life if Gomez does not surrender the family fortune. Fed up with his mother's behavior and constant berating, Gordon turns against Abigail. Using a magical book which projects its contents into reality, he unleashes a hurricane in the house, which strikes his own head with lightning and launches Tully and Abigail out a window and into open graves dug for them by Wednesday and Pugsley. Gordon turns out to actually have been Fester all along, having suffered amnesia after being lost in the Bermuda Triangle and turning up in Miami, where Abigail had taken him in. The lightning strike has restored his memory and he is enthusiastically welcomed back into the Addams household. With the family whole again, Morticia informs Gomez that she is pregnant."

In class, Baldwin soon finds out she is unable to get through the teens, of whom most are rebellious and aggressive. She constantly clashes with the school's newest student, 17-year-old Sara. Sara has been forced by her parents to enter the home and has been assigned the roommate of Gail, a model student who has a snobbish, dominant mother.

His brother Marko is a corrupt police officer who envies Miloš' life and is attracted to Marija. Marija is curious about her husband's past and is concerned about the family’s income. Lejla, a former co-star, offers Milos a starring role in an art film directed by Vukmir, an independent pornographer who wishes to cast Miloš for his powerful erection. Having already caught Petar watching one of his films and not informed on the details of Vukmir's film, Miloš is hesitant to participate and continue his career, but accepts to secure his family’s financial future. While meeting Vukmir, Miloš passes a bald man and his entourage, regarding them warily. Shooting begins at an orphanage, where Vukmir feeds Miloš instructions through an earpiece given by Vukmir's driver Raša, while a film crew follows him. Miloš sees young girl Jeca abused by her mother, who has disgraced her deceased war hero husband's memory by becoming a whore. In a dark room, screens show Jeca seductively eating an ice pop while Miloš is fellated by a nurse. Then, Miloš is instructed to receive it from the mother, while Jeca watches. Miloš refuses, but is forced to continue. Marko later informs him that Vukmir is a former psychologist and has worked in children's TV and state security. Vukmir meets a hesitant Miloš afterward to explain his artistic style, showing a film of a woman giving birth to a newborn which is immediately raped by Raša, in what the director terms ""newborn porn."" Miloš storms out and drives away. At a road junction, he is approached and seduced by Vukmir's female doctor. A bloodied Miloš wakes up in his bed some time later with no memory of what has happened. He returns to the now abandoned set and finds a number of tapes. Viewing them, Miloš discovers that he was drugged to induce an aggressive, sexually aroused and suggestible state. At Vukmir's manipulative direction, Miloš beats and rapes Jeca's mother before decapitating her to induce rigor mortis and later, a catatonic Miloš is sodomized by Vukmir's security. He then watches footage of Lejla voicing concern for Miloš, only to be restrained as her teeth are removed. A masked man then enters the room and forces his penis down her throat to kill her by suffocation. The footage continues as Miloš is led to Jeca's home where an elderly woman praises him for killing her mother and offers Jeca as a ""virgin commune."" Miloš refuses and escapes through a window to an alleyway, where he watches a girl pass by. He begins masturbating and is assaulted by a group of thugs before they are killed by Raša, who then takes Miloš back to a warehouse with Vukmir. At the warehouse, Vukmir's doctor administers more drugs after which Milos overpowers her, sticking the syringe into her throat. He is then taken into a room to have intercourse with two hidden bodies under a sheet. Miloš is guided onto one body and the masked man from Lejla’s movie enters and begins raping the other. Miloš doesn't notice that his victim is bleeding profusely from the rectum. Vukmir then reveals the masked man to be Marko, his victim to be Marija and finally, that Miloš is raping Petar, his own son. An enraged Miloš lunges at Vukmir and smashes his head against the floor, initiating a brawl during which Marija bludgeons Marko to death with a sculpture. Miloš wrestles a gun from a guard and shoots all but the one-eyed Raša, whom he kills by shoving his erect penis into his empty eye socket. A dying Vukmir praises Miloš' actions as truly worthy of film. Miloš, having recalled his actions, including locking his wife and son in their basement before passing out earlier, returns home to find them. He and his wife come to a mutual understanding that he, his wife, and his child, should die together, so the three gather in bed and embrace before Milos fires a fatal shot through himself, Petar, and Marija. Sometime later a new film crew, including the bald man from earlier, enters the bedroom. He unzips his fly, as the director advises him to ""start with the little one."""

The young Nimoy is actually quite good as the title character, a boxer whose misshapen face has earned him the unwelcome nickname ""Monk."" Formerly an unregenerate street punk, Baroni is set on the proper path by parish priest Father Callahan . Unfortunately, a run-in with his old gang forces Baroni to skip town. He becomes a professional pugilist under the aegis of manager Hellman , taking out his pent-up frustrations in the ring. Able to afford plastic surgery, Baroni buys himself a handsome new face—and, with it, a dangerously oversized ego. Hoping to protect his new face from harm, Baroni washes out in the boxing ring, but redemption—and a lasting romance with Emily Brooks --await just around the corner. Kid Monk Baroni was well-directed by Harold Schuster, whose previous efforts included My Friend Flicka and So Dear to My Heart. A flop at the box office, the film did nothing for the career of Leonard Nimoy, who was obliged to spend the next 15 years in relative obscurity before attaining a second chance at big-time stardom with TV's Star Trek."

The camera pans over a forest, shown with no background music. There is a sign that reads &#34;Quiet, isn&#39;t it?&#34; Then, the camera zooms to a hole in ground, from which emerges a worm wearing a bowler hat. The worm sees a bird in the distance and goes back down into his hole. The bird tries to get the worm out of the hole, but ends up with hanky attached to his beak. The bird writes a zero, the third on this week, in his &#34;worm ration card&#34;. The bird says that he will see us tomorrow, and goes away. The worm comes out from his hole and tells the viewers that the bird is trying to catch him every day, and that it&#39;s making him a nervous wreck. The worm wants to get rid of the bird, and then he sees a chance: a cat that chased a mouse but failed. The worm approaches the cat, and asks him if he wants to eat. The cat says that he does; and the worm shows him a plan of action: the bird chases the worm to his hole, the worm hides in it, then the cat will catch the bird and eat it. The worm tells the cat that he&#39;ll see him in the morning. The bird pulls down a rolling screen in order to bring in the next morning. The plan goes well until the cat fails to eat the bird. The cat then chases the bird around the tree, and after some time, the bird hops out of the hollow and hits the still-running cat with the club. The cat says &#34;Ouch!&#34; and then goes swearing . The worm, not having seen all of this, thinks that cat has eaten the bird, and then walks away. Then, he sees the bird and runs away, The worm tries to jump into his hole; but the bird substitutes his mouth for the hole, and the worm jumps runs away, with the bird in pursuit.

Then, worm, sitting in the hole, puts up a stick with his hat to check if here is bird. The bird itself sits on the stick; and another chase ensues. At one moment worm stops the chase and asks the bird: &#34;Are you following me?&#34; to which the bird loudly replies &#34;YEAH!&#34; and chase continues.

The worm pops his head out, says to the bird &#34;I fooled ya!&#34;, then goes in again. The bird attempts to dive into the painted hole, but crashes into the ground. The worm jumps out of the fake hole and dives into a lake. The bird &#34;lifts&#34; the water as though it were a rug, and sees the cat. The bird runs away, pursued by the cat.

She adds that her protective older brother, Will, , was very popular as a handsome basketball player. However, at a very important basketball game, Joanna pushes the mascot , who runs into Will, resulting in a loss of the game. Years later, in 2010, however, she is a successful public relations executive, recently promoted to a job in New York. When she flies home to her older brother's wedding, she discovers that Will is about to marry Joanna. When Marni meets Joanna for the first time in eight years, Joanna seems to not recognize her. Marni is also upset to see that Joanna fits in very well with the family. The plot thickens when Marni's mother Gail  meets up with Joanna's aunt Ramona , Gail's former best friend who pushed her into a pool at their senior prom. Ramona is now a successful, wealthy woman who owns several hotels and a private plane. Although Gail seems willing to put the past behind her, she still feels the need to ""outdo"" Ramona during their interactions together. On the other hand, Marni is unwilling to forget the things Joanna did to her in high school, unless she apologizes, and decides to try to let her brother know of Joanna's bullying past. Her attempts to get Will alone for a conversation fail. When Marni tells Joanna that she knows who she really is, it is obvious that Joanna remembers Marni. She refuses to give Marni a meaningful apology, and treats her disrespectfully, leaving Marni convinced that Joanna has not changed. Meanwhile, Gail comes to Ramona's hotel room for ""closure"" about anything bad between them that happened in the past. They appear to make up, but Ramona still seems not to be too fond of Gail. One day on the street, Will and Marni's grandmother Bunny  meets a man named Tim . Joanna reveals that they have dated, and Tim appears devastated when he hears that she's marrying Will. Marni decides to bring Tim to the rehearsal dinner as part of her plan to stop the wedding. When it is time for guests to make a toast to the bride and groom, Tim unexpectedly jumps up to give his toast to Joanna. He reveals to a stunned wedding party that Joanna left him at the altar. Later, a video is presented  from their old high school time capsule. The video reveals Joanna as she was in high school: an alpha-female bully, with the footage showing proof of her tormenting Marni and other students. However, Will unplugs the video projector before the video is complete and walks out, furious. Marni is in trouble when everyone discovers that she was responsible for the video at the rehearsal dinner. Even Joanna is too angry to talk to Marni, saying to her: ""I thought we could start over."" Marni is now convinced that Joanna hasn't changed, and walks away. Joanna then starts a fight with Marni, who fights back. Will walks in and witnesses the fight. He confronts Joanna, calling her a bully and a liar and then scolds Marni for starting the mess behind his back. Joanna tries to reason with Will but he doesn't care about her past and is furious that she lied to him. Meanwhile, Ramona and Gail argue after the rehearsal dinner, and Ramona accuses Gail of trying to ruin her life throughout high school. A catfight ensues, with both of them falling into the pool. Ramona reveals that she had a grudge with Gail, even when they were best friends, because she always competed with and outdid her, culminating with Gail taking the boy that Ramona wanted to the prom. Ramona stated that Gail was already a legendary head cheerleader and prom queen, and drama was supposed to be hers, yet Gail also defeated her with the auditions. She sarcastically thanks Gail for what she did, because it motivated her to become successful in life. Gail apologizes for being insensitive, but reveals that she is proud of Ramona, and that her loving family is her accomplishment. Ramona, remorseful of her actions, tells Gail that she was jealous of Gail's happy family especially that her marriages didn't work out, and feared that she was trying to take Joanna away from her. The two reconcile their friendship when Mark shows up. At home, he says that he is disgusted with the wedding and weekend being a disaster and grounds Marni and Gail. Later that night, Marni finds Joanna in the kitchen binging on junk food. She finally admits to Marni that she feels truly awful for bullying and tormenting her and feels like a terrible person, and that she loves Will and his entire family. She explained that when she found out that Marni is her fiance's sister, she panicked and therefore decided to pretend not to remember her. Marni forgives her and promises to get them back together. The next day, during a jog, Marni apologizes to Will for her actions, saying she was only trying to protect him. Joanna and Will reconcile in the family's old tree house, but it collapses and injures both of them when Ben Olsen  loosened the screws as a part of his plan in hiding the tree house. They are both forced to stay at a hospital, which delays the wedding. However, Marni puts together a makeshift wedding at the hospital, with the bride and groom bandaged, but properly dressed and able to walk down the aisle. Gail has a surprise for Ramona, it's Richie Phillips , the boy from high school that Ramona wanted to go to the prom with. Richie welcomes Ramona home and wants to be her date for the wedding, which makes Ramona very happy and they appear to start a relationship. Marni appears to start a relationship with Charlie , her brother's best friend who has always been kind to her. Joanna introduces Marni's grandmother Bunny to an old woman named Helen Sullivan . It is revealed that Helen and Bunny were rivals in high school when Helen stole a boy from her. However, Bunny gets her revenge when she cuts in on Helen's dance and takes her partner. During the credits, at the wedding reception, Marni presents her wedding gift to Will and Joanna, it's Hall & Oates in person performing Will and Joanna's favorite and special song,""Kiss on My List""! Everyone then joins Hall & Oates on stage."

She manages to reach the doorstep of Moor House, the home of Mr. St. John Rivers, a clergyman, and his two sisters. They take Jane in, saving her life. There follows a flashback, to the ten-year-old Jane Eyre, an orphan, living with her maternal uncle's family, the Reeds, at Gateshead. Jane’s aunt, Sarah Reed, doesn't like Jane and is very cruel to her; Mrs. Reed's three children are also abusive towards her. One day, Jane is locked in the Red Room, where her uncle died, and which Jane believes is haunted. She knocks herself unconscious on the door, after a huge puff of smoke comes down the chimney. Jane's aunt sends her to Lowood School for Girls, which is run by a cruel clergyman, Mr. Brocklehurst. Mrs Reed tells him that Jane is a deceitful child and is not to be trusted. Jane tells her aunt how much she hates her and that she is a hard-hearted woman. Jane arrives at Lowood. While another pupil, Helen Burns, is being beaten, Jane accidentally drops her tray. Mr. Brocklehurst brands her a liar and makes her stand on a chair all day. Jane and Helen become close friends, but Helen later dies of typhus. Eight years later, Jane leaves Lowood and takes up a post with Alice Fairfax of Thornfield Hall. She will be a governess to Adele Varens, a young French orphan girl. When she first arrives at Thornfield, a gloomy, isolated mansion, Jane mistakes Mrs. Fairfax for her employer, but she finds out that she is only the housekeeper for her absent master. While Jane is walking into town, to post a letter, a horse passes her and throws its rider. Jane helps the gentleman to his horse. Later, back at the mansion, she learns that the horse rider is Edward Rochester, master of the house. He jokingly tells her that she must have bewitched his horse to make him fall. They gradually fall in love with each other. One night, Jane is awoken by a strange noise at her door, to find that Mr. Rochester's room is on fire, which the two of them manage to extinguish. He thanks her for saving his life and holds her hand affectionately. The next day, Rochester leaves Thornfield to visit Lady Blanche Ingram, his future wife; he brings her back to Thornfield with him a few weeks later. When a man named Richard Mason, of Spanish Town, Jamaica, shows up, Jane can see that Rochester is disturbed. That night, a scream awakens everyone. Rochester assures his guests it is just a servant's reaction to a nightmare, but after they go back to their rooms, he has Jane secretly tend a bleeding Mason, while he fetches a doctor. Rochester has the doctor take Mason away. Jane receives a letter from her old nurse, Bessie. Jane's cousin, John Reed, has committed suicide, the news of which has so shocked his mother, Sarah Reed, that it has brought on a stroke. Apparently, Mrs. Reed has been asking to see Jane. Jane returns to Gateshead, where her dying aunt shows her a letter from Jane's paternal uncle, John Eyre, asking for her to go to live with him in Madeira. He wants to adopt Jane and bequeath her at his death. Jane notices that the letter was dated three years ago. Mrs. Reed admits to telling her uncle that Jane had died of typhus at Lowood School. She tells Jane that she  has been cursed by her. Jane forgives her aunt and returns to Thornfield, where she begins corresponding with John Eyre. Jane informs Rochester that she must leave Thornfield, due to his impending marriage to Blanche Ingram. But Rochester suddenly proclaims his love for Jane and proposes to her; they kiss passionately. However, during the wedding ceremony, Mr. Mason appears, along with a lawyer, declaring that Mr. Rochester cannot marry Jane, because he is still married to Mr. Mason’s sister, Bertha; he adds that his sister is still living at Thornfield Hall. Mr. Rochester admits this is true and takes Jane to meet his wife, calling her his own demon; they find her locked away in a room at Thornfield. Rochester tells Jane that his father wanted him to marry Bertha for her money. Once they were married, he discovered that she was rapidly descending into madness and was forced to lock her away in Thornfield; she was the one responsible for the strange happenings in the house. Refusing to go against her principles, and despite her love for Rochester, Jane leaves Thornfield in the middle of the night. After Jane regains her health, St. John finds her a teaching position at a nearby charity school. One night, St. John appears, informing her that her uncle, John Eyre, has died, leaving her all his property and that she is rich, to the tune of 20,000 pounds. Jane offers to share the money with St. John and his sisters, suggesting that they live together at Moor house; they agree to the offer. St. John asks Jane to marry him and go with him to India. Jane agrees to go to India with him, but rejects the marriage proposal, suggesting that they travel as brother and sister, as that's how she sees their relationship. On the moor, Jane suddenly hears Rochester's voice calling her name. Jane returns to Thornfield, only to find the house a blackened ruin. She learns from Mrs. Fairfax that Rochester's wife set the house on fire and died, jumping from the roof. Jane finds Rochester, but in the rescue attempt he has lost his eyesight. Jane reunites with him and they embrace.

There is a hilarious scene where grieving relatives of ""Missing Persons"" line up at the door to the mortuary and are quickly paraded past the various bodies, with most leads being inconclusive except for a short, bald, fat man named Emir Estupiñan  who is searching for his brother, Osler, a taxi driver who has gone missing - and who claims that ""something about the corpse is familiar"", i.e. reminiscent of his late brother. After Silampa goes to a Psychiatric Hospital where he meets with a former colleague - also mentor, as Silampa calls him ""el Maestro"" - known as Guzman, who is alternatingly psychotic and a savant and later warns him that impalement is a crime used to scare people. For other hand a lawyer named Emilio Barragan calls Councilman Marco Tulio Esquilache; apparently both are involved in the crime, as well as being related : Barragan is married to the niece of Esquilache - and is the perfect caricature of the snobbish philanderer. At the same time, the councilman also calls Vargas Vicuña a civil engineer who is very interested in the land near the lake where the body was found impaled. One night Silampa goes to a brothel called ""Lolita"". Estupiñan has invited him to talk with a man who might have some information about the murder. They drink together convivially, and Silampa is told by the truck driver named Abuchija that he had loaded ""a package"" to take it from Tunja to Choconta to an abandoned house. He cynically reports that he ""asked no questions"", only by business and played by a beautiful woman. Silampa feels bad by the hemorrhoids and the asthma but when leaving he is accosted by a beautiful young prostitute named Quica. Quica is already busy with a table of drunks and offers him another appointment because she was busy. The next day Silampa and Estupiñan go where Abuchija, the truck driver had dropped ""the package"" and enter a small abandoned house near the lake and discover important clues : a construction sign of Vargas Vicuña, a chair with some blood on it, and a sign of Turkish baths ""The Earthly Paradise."" Estupiñan is involved with the case just to find his brother who apparently went missing right around the time the impaled corpse was supposedly murdered - and confuses Silampa to work for the ""secret police"" because of his ""education"" and ""access"" to governmental corridors which are closed to Estupinan. Meanwhile, Vargas Vicuña calls Barragan, from the grounds of the lake and asks him to be his lawyer to help him acquire the land as soon as possible. Silampa reports his research to Colonel Moya and the Colonel appears more interested in, and emphasizes that the journalist continue writing his speech for ""The Last Supper"" congregation. Silampas decides to investigate the Turkish baths ""The Earthly Paradise."" and goes to meet Quica that night at the ""Lolita Bar"". She takes him up to a room. Silampa is very drunk and cannot have sex with her, although she undresses and he takes a picture of her - and the room  He wakes up the next morning in Quica's house where she says that because he was so drunk, some people helped put him in a cab to her house. Trying to act tough and older than her years, she claims he owes her money, to which the journalist smilingly agrees - but she reveals her soft-hearted side and her growing fascination with him and gives him a coffee while he is in the shower. Silampa offers to take her out - but by day - revealing that he is getting emotionally attracted to the young prostitute. Estupiñan drives round with Silampa's car, picks him up for breakfast and the journalist goes home and continues to write Colonel Moya's speech. Esquilache and Barragan spend the weekend together at their palatial hacienda, going riding in the morning and playing snooker and drinking and talking business at night. Esquilache asks Barragan about the deed to the land where the body was found. He tells that the document or Deed of Ownership of the recently-deceased entrepreneur named Casiodoro Pereira Antunez, but the Deed does not appear to be in the files of the city, and no one has claimed inheritance. Esquilache warns that the land would pass to the district if no one claims ownership and then Colombia Constructions would own the land, and be responsible for developing the area - but this would mean more bribes to be passed around, and less for Esquilache and Barragán. Both go to meet Heliodoro Tiflis - the flamboyant  owner of the ""Lolita"" bar, requesting him to track down the Deed for the land at the lake, pleading with him that not finding the Deed of this land would be catastrophic, as it would then be expropriated by and for the district. Silampa and Quica both arrive in the Turkish baths ""The Earthly Paradise, where there is a sect devoted to naturism and nudity. While registering, Silampa notes a portrait of the founder Casiodoro Pereira Antunez - the same man who owned the land now wanted by all since his demise. In a hilarious sequence, the naked Silampa goes ""detecting"" and sneaks out and reads the registration of a suspicious car mentioned by Abuchija. he goes back inside and spends time with Quica and meets the supposed car-owner named Susan Caviedes, who is the Manager of the Baths. Later Quica and Silampa go to the ""Lolita"" nightclub where they dance. Quica tells him that her brother, was killed by soldiers, not knowing if they were paramilitary, the army or guerrillas. Silampa invites Quica to his house and they spend the night together. Silampa finds in the newspaper archives a photo of the burial of Pereria Antunez, and asks a colleague who identifies Vargas Vicuña, Barragan, Esquilache and Tiflis were all in attendance. He asks his colleague to help a bit but the other reporter wants to take Silampa's car; he leaves with the keys only to come back and notifies him that the vehicle has been seriously damaged. Silampa goes to take a look at the vandalised car - windshields knocked in, and a turd on the bonnett, with graffiti that reads ""AQUI ESTUVIMOS, AQUI COMIMOS Y AQUI NOS CAGAMOS"" . Silampa realizes that both he and Quica were in danger, and asks Quica to not go to work anymore in the bar and escape with him temporarily. Tiflis meets and taunts Vargas Vicuña and mocks the engineer by offering several prostitutes. Tiflis becomes aware of Silampa and asks his henchmen to monitor the journalist's home and wait for him to arrive. Silampa has however already moved in with Quica. Estupiñan offers to do him a favor and disguises himself as a plumber, enters the home and picks up Moya's speech and some elements of the investigation. Moya asks Silampa to get away from the investigation but at the same time gives a cell phone to connect with him. Susan, the manager of the Turkish baths turns out to be a former prostitute, and Silampa follows her up to Tiflis hotel penthouse. Apart from the obvious luxury of being on the top floor of a City Hotel. When Tiflis and Susan leave after having sex, Silampa goes to the top floor residence of the don and he finds the Deed documents. The journalist steals the document and flees the scene accompanied by a taxi driver met on the road. Silampa reviews the Deed that night at the home of Quica. The next day while Esquilache and Vargas Vicuña are driving around looking for the Deed, from the registrar's office they get the name of the journalist and Nancy, Barragan's secretary. Vargas and his thugs arrive at the apartment of journalist, and exchanged shoots with those of Tifilis who are already entrenched in there. Esquilache and his driver come soon after and then leave, while Estupiñan and Abuchija, the driver as witnesses. Quica and Silampa are assaulted by a gunman of Tifilis in search of the document and to defend Quica, Silampa takes a beating and is wounded. Quica accidentally kills the assassin with a knife. While interrogating Tiflis and his thugs, Esquilache is urbanely told by the gangster that if the Deed turns up, Tiflis will share it for an unspecified share of the profits. An increasingly belaboured Councilman Esquilache calls the lawyer Barragan, who also denies having the Deed, although he has a copy. The next day Tiflis angrily reproaches his lover and his henchman for the loss of the documents, and asks his gunman to keep Susan hostage until he finds the document. Silampa and Estupiñan go to the Psychiatric Hospital to meet with Guzman, and are told by him that this impaled body was probably Pereira Antunez. They express disbelief as by that time Antunez had already been buried for a month or more. Guzman counters by saying:""You have been looking for a dead man amongst the living."" It is also during this visit - when Silampa expresses that he feels defeated - that he quotes Juan Sepulveda : ""Lost is a Question of Method..."". He gets increasingly agitated as Silampa is expressing being disheartened - ultimately having to be calmed down by staff, cutting short the visit. At night, Estupiñan and Silampa go to a bar by the Cemetery, where the lady who owns it introduces them to a grave-digger, who has obvious visible signs of Leprosy. He takes them into the cemetery to see the tomb of Pereira Antunez and with the help of Jaime Bengala, the leper grave-digger open the tomb only to discover that the body was that of Osler, Estupiñan's brother. This decides Estupinan that no matter what the danger, he is going to avenge his brother. As they part ways, Jaime Bengala repeatedly tells them his name, asking them not to forget it. Silampa shakes his hand, alive to the fact of the leper's social marginalisation - but as he is walking away, he turns back and invites the leper to come drink with them. The three men sit drinking at a cheap bar table until dawn, when Estupiñan and Silampa stagger home. The camera rises over the panorama as they walk away and the misty high-rises of Bogota become visible barely a stone's throw away from this down-trodden area of the city where they have spent the night in shared humanity with a leper as upon the heartless world of the crime-ridden metropolis. Esquilache is being followed by Abuchija and Estupiñan as he arrives in his official car at an apartment where he confronts Barragan - who is extremely agitated and hysterical, and pulling a gun, alternately levels it at the Councilman and his own temple. He has discovered that Esquilache was complicit in the impalement of Pereira Antunez and this is the impaled. The Councilman cannot hide his despising his niece's husband, and in a sudden reversal, Barragan who has been putting the gun into his mouth and to his temple, shoots Esquilache and is killed by the lawyer. The body falls dramatically several floors. Quica and Silampa arrive at the scene and seeing the corpse of Esquilache, Silampa asks Estupiñan to take care of Quica. the police arrive and handcuff Silampa - as Barragan in his elegant suit calmly walks away after casting a slight glance at the body. Silampa is taken to the police station where Moya congratulates him on the case being practically solved: Pereira Antúnez was forced to transfer land to Tifilis, possibly after being roughed up. After which Vargas Vicuña manages to kidnap him from Tiflis and wants to force Pereira Antunez to sign the Deed. Silampa has deduced that the signature of the document took place in the room of the bar “Lolitas” where Silampa had been with Quica and taken her picture. Later Pereira had been kidnapped by Vargas Vicuña, but Pereira died of diabetes - and Vargas and his thugs - unable to get the Deed - impaled him to scare the nudists of the Turkish baths. They also killed Osler Estupiñan, who had a resemblance to Antunez, and buried him as Pereira Antúnez. Moya tells Silampa when he is brought to the Police station that as he has already solved the case, he should now go home and rest, specially as Vargas, Tifilis, Susan and, separately, Barragán have been captured. Moya asks him to go home and finish his speech. In the school-room where they are being held, Tifilis confesses to Vargas that it was he had kidnapped Pereira Antúnez - for thinking that his partner, Susan, had not succeeded when Pereira would not sign the document. Accusations and counter-accusations fly -as each reveals the facts about the other. Susan, Vargas and Tiflis get into a fight. Colonel Moya enters the room, and sits in the school-teacher's chair, after fishing out from the trash can a tape-recorder that has the whole incriminating conversation on it. He calmly proposes to them to collaborate with him, and make him a beneficiary in the land deal - stating Barragan would take the rap for all the crimes, while all of them would enjoy the spoils. Moya, sitting at his desk, recounts for Silampa's benefit the police's closing report - ""the Official Version"" ! Silampa is enraged at the neatly self-serving concoction of Truth that Moya is pandering but helpless in front of the Colonel's power. The Colonel reminds him that in fucking Quica he was having sex with a minor, and that the body of Tifli's henchman Morsita was found stabbed to death in Quica's apartment - and if Silampa is going to be exceedingly particular about ""justice"" - Moya requests Silampa to forget about justice, to go along and publish ""the official version"" as his journalistic effort and ""win the Simon Bolivar Prize for Journalism"" so that his girlfriend will return to him upon his getting famous, if not rich - and also to finish the speech for ""The Last Supper"" and deliver it to him. Silampa leaves impotent, chastened and hemmorhoidal and surprised when sees Vargas Vicuña and Susan Caviedes goes free. Osler Estupiñan is finally buried in his own tomb - with Estupinan, Silampa and the leprous grave-digger Bengala in attendance, as mourners. As Silampa finishes writing the speech of Moya, Quica visits Silampa as she has got a job as a crooner in Cartagena, arranged by Estupiñan. She is happy about the opportunity but obviously wants to be with Silampa. In a touching cinematic movement, she initially enters the doorway of his apartment, but as it becomes clear to her that Silampa chooses his loneliness over the possibility of happiness with her, she slowly drifts outside of the threshold again - reproaching him wistfully for his choosing his mannequin over the living, breathing woman. The credits start to roll as Moya - sitting on the centre of a ballroom dinner - starts declaining his speech. The title track once again plays as the creme de la creme of Colombian society mutually applaud each other on this sham scene of a religious vow ""to starve"" - even as the viewer becomes aware that it is not just food, but the very nation that they are greedily feeding upon."

A journalist named Victor Silampa  is writing an article a la Peter Gay, about bourgeouise attitudes about Romantic Love through the 17th to 19th centuries. He refers the corrections to a mannequin installed by the window - mockingly asking her for advice, and referring to her as 'Laura' with mock endearments. This appears to be a device to assuage his loneliness as he has recently been dumped by his wife, Silampa receives a call from the Police-Colonel Aristophanes Moya  who calls him to the station immediately notifying him of the crime. Moya suggests an exchange of favors , whereby the journalist would actively investigate the case while Moya will provide him with protection if, in addition, the journalist will ""ghost-write"" for him a speech for a slimming non-conformist Evangelical Christian sect, originating in Memphis, called ""The Last Supper"" - who advocate losing weight through Bible Study, confession and dietary changes.

According to Dr. Bruhling , Craig is suffering from a paralyzed cerebral cortex, a state that may render him dangerous and that is in all likelihood induced by someone else. And, sure enough, Nick has barely begun to understand what the good doctor is suggesting when Craig is found hovering over the dead body of his brother-in-law, George Phillips . But is the cataleptic banker actually a killer or is someone even more dangerous behind the murder? The trail leads Nick and Billie to a nearby shack where strange experiments have recently been conducted and, in time, to the real culprit.

Orangutans, like humans, have ""culture."" They do not rely solely on animal instinct for survival. Instead a rich and complex society of elders and peers provides the young with critical knowledge that is necessary for their survival in the rainforest. The destruction of the orangutan's habitat to make way for palm oil plantations and the illegal pet-trade threaten the lives of these great apes. When they are taken out of their habitat or when it is destroyed, their culture is disabled. Dr. Willie Smits, director of the Wanariset Orangutan Reintroduction Project, and his team rescue hundreds of orangutans. Dr. Smits is committed to preserving orangutan habitat and returning captives back into rainforest homes. Dr Carl Van Schaik, primatologist, discusses the rapidly diminishing opportunity to learn about human evolution as the number of wild orangutans dwindles precariously. He believes questions such as, 'where does our culture come from?' can be answered through the study of orangutan culture and in this context discusses the incredibly fragile culture of the solitary orangutan. At Wanariset the orphans learn the skills they need to survive in the wild. When they are old and skilled enough they are released into protected rainforest. Without mothers and more knowledgeable elders, strange 'Lord of the Flies' communities evolve in the forest. Eventually the orangutans learn to sustain themselves without human aid. With the impending extinction of orangutans, opportunities to observe and interact them in their natural setting are reduced. ""Poignant without sentimentality...making us think hard about the meanings and values of culture and nature."" Prof. Lorraine Daston, Director, Max Planck Institute for the History of Science"

With Chad driving off and leaving her alone at the lake, Layla goes into the water to retrieve the necklace when she sees a girl seemingly drown. When Layla swims to the buoy to look for the girl, it's as if the girl was never there and she swims back toward the shore. However, before she can get out of the water, she sees the girl floating lifelessly in front of her. Leaning down to see if the girl is okay, Layla is pulled into the water and drowned by the girl, who is revealed to be a demon-like incarnation of the unnamed girl who had disappeared the night before. Meanwhile, Chad arrives at Sandy and Eli's house with a different girl in tow, candy striper Cecilia . Looking on in disgust, Sandy asks what would Layla think, with Chad replying, ""Who?"" Before anything else happens, Chad leaves to take Cecilia back to the hospital. As the rest of the group is waiting for T.J.  to get off of work, T.J. is negotiating a deal to buy an engagement ring for his girlfriend, Lex . After bartering his paycheck for the ring, T.J. is asked to check the safety on machines one, two, and three before going home. As he is alone, he opts to smoke a little pot before doing so. After checking the safety on the first two machines, T.J. believes he sees someone at the other end of the warehouse before deducting it was an hallucination, stating, ""Note to self: drugs are bad."" However, he is soon scared by the sight of the demonic Layla and gets his caught in the machine , before having his head pushed into the machine by the unnamed demonic girl. Just after this, Jake  remembers he forgot to get beer for their trip, to which Sandy replies that T.J. was supposed to be bringing it. However, just like Layla, the rest of the group has no memory of T.J. and Sandy decides to call him, only to find his contact information erased from her cellphone. Just then, Jake and Lex's dad, Sheriff Mitchell , pulls up in his patrol car to drop off Lex. Opting to go on with their spring break trip to the beach, the group stops at a convenience, with Lex distracting the cashier by having sex with him in the backroom while the rest of the friends steal liquor and food. Frustrated with Lex's seemingly promiscuous behavior despite dating T.J., Sandy walks off while Eli and Hannah  look on. Going after Sandy, Jake asks who T.J. is and calls Chad to check to make sure he is on his way. After hanging up, however, Chad is killed when the ghosts scare him into flipping his car, with the unnamed girl making it explode. Leaving the store, the group gets into Eli's Jeep with Sandy asking Jake where his bike went, to which responds that he had left it at her house. Once on the road, Sandy becomes even more confused when her stuff and the beach gear are gone, but her friends look at her confusingly, asking why they would be taking a boogie board to the mountains for spring break. Just then, Sandy yells at Eli to pull the car over, with Sandy getting out to look at Chad's car, battered and dirty in a junkyard. However, for some strange reason, no one but Sandy remembers who Chad is, and they soon drive to T.J.'s house, which appears vacant and in ruin, the apparent scene of some unknown crime of some sort, as there is caution tape around the house and yard. As Sandy goes into the house with her boyfriend Jake and her brother Eli, the other girls, Lex and Hannah, get into an argument in the car. At the same time, Sandy begins to remember the unnamed girl from the graveyard as her friend when she was little, but nothing more. Later, Lex is killed by what appears to be undead versions of her murdered friends, with Sandy witnessing her demise. The other three think Sandy is losing her mind, as none of the others remember Lex anymore. Sandy and the others go to the police station, where they learn the mysterious girl's name is Angela Smith and she lives in a convent. Sandy begs her friends to go with her, and they agree, but also agree to wait until morning. At a local hotel, Sandy sleeps due to a sleeping pill in her drink while Hannah and Eli go to the pool and have sex. Eli goes back up to the room to find Jake trying to contain Sandy who is throwing herself around in the room. Hannah is killed, and Sandy and Jake are now alone in the hotel room. Eli calls Sandy and tells her he can no longer cover for her. She then tells him to meet her at the convent. She and Jake then discover Angela is in a coma. At the convent, Jake is killed. Eli, who doesn't remember Jake, picks up a shaken Sandy. Sandy cries over her dead boyfriend, and Eli begins to realize that they are being erased in time, just like the rhyme they sang before playing the game in the graveyard. After heading home, Sandy, whose parents believe she has become depressed and suicidal, is sedated and taken to the hospital. While there, Eli is attacked and killed by the undead versions of his murdered friends. As Sandy is sedated again once at the hospital, she asks for Eli, of whom her parents have no recollection at all. Asking if Eli is a friend of hers, Sandy's parents tells the doctor that she has no friends. Later, Sandy dreams of a time where she and her friends played a scary prank on Angela , who had a seizure in front of the convent after knocking her head into the door. It is soon revealed that the little girl at the beginning of the film is a young Sandy, and the girl who mysteriously vanished and who has been committing the murders is, in fact, Angela. Sandy awakes and, recalling the rhyme to ""kill the ghost or seal your fate,"" goes to Angela's room and switches off her life support. Leaving the room, she hears beats from Angela's cardiac monitor and returns to the room, only to find Angela sitting up in her bed. Sandy is then chased up to the roof by the ghosts of her friends, and encounters the young version of Angela. Despite a failed attempt to reason with her, Sandy falls from the roof of the hospital. The film ends with Angela ""miraculously"" awaking from her coma, while Sandy is revealed to have taken her place in a coma of her own. The mystery about Eli & the friends is not revealed whether they were imaginary people or real."

While at a vampire meeting, Stacy explains how she struggled with drug addiction as a human, but was now happy since being a vampire gave her a second-chance. Goody also discovers that if their maker or ""stem"" Ciccerus is ever killed, they would revert back to their human ages. Stacy then meets a young man named Joey  in her night class. She finds out that Joey's last name is Van Helsing, but believes it may just be a coincidence.

The community matchmaker brings Ammaiyappan a promising alliance. It is a good family. The groom is a junior officer at BHEL and his father owns a garment shop in the city. The meeting starts off well. But Sarojini, true to form, rejects the alliance and the groom's party abruptly leaves. Ammaiyappan visits them to apologize for the incident. The groom's father turns out to be an understanding and forward thinking man. Looking past Sarojini's immaturity and recognizing Ammaiyappan to be a good and honest man, he offers his daughter Vasantha as a prospective partner for Siva. He declares, as a veiled insult, that his obedient daughter Vasantha will accept his decision. Not outdone, Ammaiyappan quickly accepts with the claim that his son is similarly respectful of his wishes. When Ammaiyappan returns home, Sarojini informs him that she has found her own partner in Peter Fernandes, a Catholic colleague from her work place &mdash; an unthinkable notion for Ammaiyappan and Godavari. But when Ammaiyappan visits Peter's father Albert Fernandes, he is surprised. Albert Fernandes turns out to be compassionate, tolerant and accepting of Sarojini's belligerence. Ammaiyappan agrees to the alliance. Chidambaram remains opposed to Sarojini's choice, but nonetheless obtains a loan to finance her wedding. Sarojini and Peter are married, and Siva and Vasantha are married. After an initial period of honeymoon bliss, the troubles start again. Sarojini returns home late one evening after an office party. When Peter's father questions her, she brashly cites her independence and refuses to answer him. Peter tries to talk to her, but she adamantly turns him off too. After a big fight, she walks out. Back at Ammaiyappan's home, Vasantha is frustrated because her time is increasingly devoted to tutoring Bharathi . She is unable to have any quiet time with Siva, and this is further complicated by the joint family arrangement where personal space is limited anyway. She ends up in a big fight with Siva, and she ultimately walks out. Vasantha returns to an unwelcome reception at her own home. Her father initially tries to reason with her, but when she remains indignant, he firmly instructs her to return to her husband and work out their problems. She finally understands the message and returns home. Siva, who had followed her, reinforces her father's message. However, he clearly prioritizes Bharathi's education over her need for quiet time. She accepts this as a temporary necessity, but remains unhappy nonetheless. There is an unintended side-effect in that Sarojini, having seen how Siva went to fetch his wife, reaffirms her stand to remain away from Peter until Peter crawls back to get her. There is a greater crisis when Chidambaram reduces his monthly contribution to the family fund. He cites reasons of reduced consumption , excess burden  and limited income . Ammaiyappan advises him that the fund is not designed as a mathematical fraction but rather as a communal fund to ensure the family runs smoothly. He reminds Chidambaram that he had spent the largest fractions of his income, without regard to return or reward, on Chidambaram's upbringing and education. Chidambaram disputes these claims. The argument erupts into a terrible fight. Ammaiyappan disowns Chidambaram and kicks him out. Chidambaram refuses to leave until his loans are paid off. Ammaiyappan orders a line to be drawn midway through the house. He banishes Chidambaram to one side of the line and forbids everyone from speaking to Chidambaram. Ammaiyappan declares that Chidambaram must leave when his loans have been repaid. When Uma returns with her new baby, she is shocked to find so many problems. She works with Kannamma ([[Manorama , the longtime household maid and Godavari  to fix these troubles and restore harmony. She starts by visiting Albert Fernandes. On her suggestion, Mr. Fernandes returns to Ammaiyappan's house and starts a loud squabble with Kannamma. Mr. Fernandes brings divorce papers. Sarojini is shaken. Kannamma and Godavari compel her, in the heat of the fight with Mr. Fernandes, to sign the papers. Mr. Fernandes completes the charade by handing her an invitation to Peter's upcoming wedding with another girl. Sarojini finally realizes the gravity of the situation. She returns to Peter and his father. They forgive her and warmly accept her again. Uma's second task is to reconcile Siva and Vasantha. She calls Siva at work and gently rebukes him for not attending to his wife's needs. Siva plans a vacation where he and Vasantha are able to revive their relationship, reaffirm their priorities and return to a new life together. Vasantha continues tutoring Bharathi. Bharathi finally passes his exams. Uma has mixed feelings: she is glad that the troubles have been resolved, but she is sad that Siva and Bharathi, still in compliance with Ammaiyappan's orders, have not spoken a word with her. Finally, Uma tackles the raging conflict between Chidambaram and Ammaiyappan. She scans his expenses and reminds him that costs are actually reduced when items are obtained in larger quantities. She also reminds him that Ammaiyappan does not charge rent. She also reminds him of his filial responsibilities. In the meantime, Kannamma reminds Ammaiyappan that his family is all he has, and that he should think of his children and grandchildren as his legacy and not his adversaries. Chidambaram and Ammaiyappan are finally reconciled. Uma makes her final move when Chidambaram is about to step across the line. She reminds everyone that what started as small arguments ended up as a huge conflict that nearly broke up the family. She suggests that it is best for her and Chidambaram to move out. The house is probably too cramped for two couples  to be comfortable. She promises to visit every weekend and spend time with the family. The film ends with Chidambaram and Uma making regular visits to see everyone.

They all have chakra-knives, which are uniquely-designed trench knives that allow a ninja to infuse their chakra with it to produce an added effect. They set out for the once glorious historic ruins of Rouran, a city with one thousand towers and is located in the middle of the desert. They pursue and corner the missing-nin. Mukade's goal is revealed to travel to the past and take over the Five Great Shinobi Countries with the power of the Ryūmyaku, an ancient chakra flow deep underground Rouran. He unleashes the power of the Ryūmyaku, which is seen to have been sealed by Minato Namikaze , causing a light to envelop Naruto and Yamato, who was trying to stop Mukade. Sai stops Sakura from getting sucked in by the Ryūmyaku by grabbing her onto his ink bird and flies to safety, leaving Naruto and Yamato in the mysterious light. Naruto and Yamato are sent twenty years into the past. When Naruto awakens from this time slip, he meets the queen of Rouran, Sāra. It's later revealed that Mukade traveled to the past 6 years before Naruto did. By this point he has changed his name to Anrokuzan and serves as the minister of Rouran. He has killed Sāra's mother Sēramu, the previous queen, and is now attempting to kill Sāra and take over the world. Naruto tells Sāra that he will protect her. Anrokuzan appears to have slaves - who are citizens of Rouran - who do his dirty work. With the Ryūmyaku, Anrokuzan is able to create the ""Puppet Ninja Forces"", which can attack using the Ryūmyaku's chakra, and are able to use weapons such as kunai and deflect attacks.  Minato Namikaze is now seen at Konoha, and Jiraiya shows Minato that he has completed the Rasengan. Then the young Shizune, Maito Gai, Asuma Sarutobi, and Kakashi Hatake are waiting in a long line at the grand opening of the Ichiraku Ramen Bar. Hiruzen Sarutobi has heard of Anrokuzan's evil plans, and sends Minato Namikaze, Shibi Aburame, Chōza Akimichi, and upon Minato's request, Kakashi Hatake, to put an end to his plans. Naruto later comes into contact with Minato, who is now on his mission. Minato tells Naruto that he too is a Konoha ninja, and tells him to go back to his own time period, as it's not safe at Rouran. He then tells Naruto the circumstances at Rouran, and gives Naruto his hirashin kunai to hold on to. While Minato is talking to Naruto, Sāra has a flashback of when she was a little kid and her mother. They were singing until Anrokuzan came and stabbed Sēramu, while Sāra ran away. Later Anrokuzan is seen to be a giant puppet, he is able to use parts of the towers of Rouran to repair himself from any attack, which is part of his regenerative technique with the power of the Ryūmyaku. Naruto goes up against Anrokuzan in a battle using his Shadow Clone Jutsu, Rasengan and Wind Style: Rasenshuriken, but fails. Naruto's out of chakra, having no way to fight him, Naruto is left defenseless. Minato then comes and saves Naruto and by lending Naruto his chakra the Rasengan was formed in his hand and at the same time Minato forms a Rasengan as well. By having similar chakra, their chakras resonate with each other growing more powerful by the second. They then combine their Rasengan to form the legendary Super Rasengan. Sāra seals off most of the Ryūmyaku, making Anrokuzan unable to use his regenerative technique. Minato goes off and exposes Anrokuzan's weak spot, then tells Naruto that this is the time to attack him. Naruto succeeds in hitting him with the Super Rasengan. Anrokuzan states that this is not be over. As the floor crumbles, he falls down into a pool of the Ryūmyaku. Sāra is still seen on the crumbling floor, Naruto manages to catch her, but falls in too. Yamato, who is holding on to Kakashi, comes and uses his Wood Style to catch Naruto. Minato asks Naruto to give back his kunai to completely seal off the Ryūmyaku. A bright blue light shines as Minato seals the Ryūmyaku. Naruto and Yamato's bodies begin to glow. Minato says since that Anrokuzan is dead, his spell, which made them travel to the past, wears off. Minato decides it's best to have all of everyone's memories erased in order to not to change history. Naruto tells Minato that they still need to talk, and that if he doesn't now he'll never have the chance to. As Minato begins placing a seal, Naruto begins to realize something, but was interrupted by Minato's reply that if he ever has a son he wishes that he be brought up as a ninja like Naruto . Sāra tells Naruto that she'll never forget what Naruto had taught her. Naruto and Yamato's bodies completely fade away. In the present time, the Ryūmyaku that is unleashed by Mukade fades away. Sakura is still seen on Sai's ink bird crying out Naruto's name. Sakura and Sai retrieve Naruto and Yamato, who don't seem to remember the events that had just transpired. As they wander outside, Naruto and the group run into someone who greatly resembles Queen Sāra - she says that she'd felt a disturbance in the Ryūmyaku, pulling out the chakra blade that Naruto had given to Queen Sara during the events of the time slip. It is nicked and damaged, as if it had been through twenty years of use. Naruto, recognizing the blade, instinctively reaches for the sheath on his back, but of course, he does not have the blade. The girl says that it was a blade given to her mother by a 'hero in a dream,' and that the will of her mother lived on in her as she strives to protect her people. As she walks away, Naruto is contemplative, and comments that she reminded him of someone he'd met before. Sakura then grabs and pulls on Naruto's ear and yells at him for having 'perverted daydreams.'"

Many of them cling precariously to their social positions with only one figure, the wealthy self-made businessmen Mr Wright, being truly successful. The house is owned by the grasping Mrs Sharpe who mistreats the maid, Stasia, a rehabilitated juvenile delinquent. The various members of the household are miserable and openly sneering and rude towards each other. The one exception being the respect shown by all to the powerful Mr Wright. In the case of one couple, Major Tomkin and his wife, this involves pressurising their daughter Vivian to marry Wright in spite of her obvious horror at the idea. The house's familiar routine is thrown off balance by the sudden arrival of a mysterious foreign stranger, intended by the author to be an allegorical, Christ-like figure. Polite and charming, he swiftly earns the respect of the others in the house, especially that of Stasia. He takes a room on the ""third floor back"" and joins the residents for the dinner supposedly held in celebration of the marriage between Wright and Vivian. It becomes evident that she doesn't want to marry Wright, as she is in love with one of the other lodgers, and she storms out of the room. The desperate Major later tries to convince Wright that it is a misunderstanding and that the engagement is still on, as he and his wife are terrified by the loss of security if the marriage is broken off. The stranger observes the meanness shown by the other members of the house, and gently encourages them to treat each other better and to pursue their dreams rather than live in fear about their precarious social position. This gradually begins to work with some of the house's members convinced by his charisma. One bank holiday the stranger announces that he will treat them all to a trip on a boat to Margate surprising the more snobbish residents by insisting that the servants, including Stasia, will join them. Despite the initial awkwardness, the outing soon begins to go well. When Stasia falls in the River Thames one of the woman jumps in to save her life. Once she is rescued she is looked after by the Tomkins who treat her as though she were there daughter, and also begin to regret their bullying of their own daughter into a marriage with Wright. During the trip various members of the house begin to enjoy themselves and treat each other with more respect. This change in their situation earns Wright's resentment, and he begins to spitefully plan to wreck the stranger's attempts to reform the guests. This becomes apparent when the next day the inhabitants return to their previous unhappy existence and resume fighting. Wright taunts the stranger by demonstrating how easily he has corrupted them through the simple power of his money. The stranger tries to convince Wright that he too should try and seek a better and happier life, but Wright rejects this suggestion. Their dispute develops into a moral battle between the stranger's goodness and Wright's evil."

The desperate Major later tries to convince Wright that it is a misunderstanding and that the engagement is still on, as he and his wife are terrified by the loss of security if the marriage is broken off. The stranger observes the meanness shown by the other members of the house, and gently encourages them to treat each other better and to pursue their dreams rather than live in fear about their precarious social position. This gradually begins to work with some of the house's members convinced by his charisma. One bank holiday the stranger announces that he will treat them all to a trip on a boat to Margate surprising the more snobbish residents by insisting that the servants, including Stasia, will join them. Despite the initial awkwardness, the outing soon begins to go well. When Stasia falls in the River Thames one of the woman jumps in to save her life. Once she is rescued she is looked after by the Tomkins who treat her as though she were there daughter, and also begin to regret their bullying of their own daughter into a marriage with Wright. During the trip various members of the house begin to enjoy themselves and treat each other with more respect. This change in their situation earns Wright's resentment, and he begins to spitefully plan to wreck the stranger's attempts to reform the guests. This becomes apparent when the next day the inhabitants return to their previous unhappy existence and resume fighting. Wright taunts the stranger by demonstrating how easily he has corrupted them through the simple power of his money. The stranger tries to convince Wright that he too should try and seek a better and happier life, but Wright rejects this suggestion. Their dispute develops into a moral battle between the stranger's goodness and Wright's evil."

To avoid the police on their tail they go and shelter in Strawberry's house, where Gribble meets Strawberry's daughter Jane who he is immediately smitten by. Despite finally persuading Strawberry to fill out his form Gribble is sacked by his bosses when they discover that it was he who originally showed the newspapermen round the town. His problems mount when he is beset by an angry mob of townspeople who have found the abandoned forms on the street and blame Gribble for the cover up. He is also pursued by a bailiff for the money he owes. However, Jane comes up with the idea of Gribble running for the council on a pro-town planning platform. With the support of the newspaper he soon builds up a head of steam and looks likely to be elected. Oxbold and his colleagues plan top this by getting their hands on the forms to destroy the evidence of their dishonesty. After Gribbles' furniture is possessed by the bailiffs including the vase where he had stored the forms, he takes part in a desperate race against clock in order to recover them and produce them at a major town planning conference. Gribble fails to recover them but is saved by Strawberry who had recorded them electronically. The film ends with the crooked councillers exposed and Gribble being hailed by the people.

The names of characters and places have been changed for legal reasons. For example, Bhanwari's character is called Sanwari, her husband Mohan's character is called Sohan, and their village is called Dhabri . The story is introduced through first-part narration by a foreign reporter called Amy , who has read about Sanwari's case in a newspaper. Amy and her friend-cum-interpreter Ravi  visit Sanwari's village to investigate the matter, five years after the gang rape incident. On their arrival in Rajasthan, they encounter an old man Sohan , who helps them on their way to a village where they encounter Sanwari's rapists. Sohan turns out to be Sanwari's husband, and tells the tale of Sanwari's rape case. Shobha  is a social worker who works for the Government of India. Her job involves create awareness against child-marriage and other social evils. In Dhabri, she recruits Sanwari  as a saathin, a grassroots worker employed as part of the Women's Development Project run by the Government of Rajasthan. Sanwari is a low-caste potter; her husband Sohan is a rickshaw-puller, and the couple has a young girl called Kamli. As part of her job, Sanwari educates the womenfolk in the village against child marriages, and invites ire of the conservative village elders. Most of these villagers belong to the Gurjar community, which is upper in the caste hierarchy. Five men decide to teach Sanwari a lesson, when she informs the police about a child marriage happening in the Gurjar community. They beat up her husband and gang-rape her. Sanwari and Sohan go to the police station, but the inspector  refuses to lodge a First Information Report in absence of a medical report. The doctor won't issue a medical report in absence of a court order. With Shobha's help, the couple finally manages to get a court order. With the court order, they get a medical certificate in Jaipur, and a complaint is lodged two days after the incident. However, the rapists are not arrested and roam around freely, boasting about their experience with Sanwari. Sanwari's case gets nation-wide attention and the Prime Minister of India himself entrusts the investigation to the Central Bureau of Investigation. A women's NGO in Delhi also tries to help Sanwari. The accused are arrested and tried in the court, but they are backed by the local MLA Dhanraj Meena . Meena hires a lawyer called Purohit to defend the accused. A Gurjar lawyer  defends Saanwari, but faces pressure from his community to favor the accuse. The judges handling the case are transferred multiple times, and the final judgement goes against her. Bhanwari refuses to give up her fight for justice, in spite of unhelpful villagers and relatives, an incompetent police force, and a corrupt judicial system.

Velma  and Shaggy  are waiting by the van for Fred  and Daphne  so they can go to meet Daphne's Uncle, who has given them summer jobs at his country club in Erie Point so the gang can pay for the damages they did to a barn setting it on fire during one of their mysteries. They then find Fred and Daphne making out in the back of the van. Daphne reveals that they started dating after she fell out of the top of the barn from the mystery that caused them to get the summer jobs and he had caught her, making her realize that he was ""the one."" Velma warns them that often when two people in a group start dating, any changes of that relationship affects the whole group, but the two don't seem to care. On the way to the country club, Fred gets lost. They stop at a small country store called Trowburg's where a seemingly crazy woman tells them that she warned them not to build the country club, and that the Lake Monster will return. Velma tells them that there have been sightings of the lake monster for hundreds of years. Shaggy immediately rejects the idea of going any farther, but the rest of the gang ignores him. When they arrive there, they are greeted by Daphne's Uncle, Thornton ""Thorny"" Blake V. He shows them to their quarters, and when Shaggy is getting his bags off the top of the Mystery Machine, he falls off and is caught by Velma, who he then falls in love with. Shaggy asks Scooby  if there is any chance of him and Velma. The next day, Shaggy is caddying with Fred, when he asks Fred for dating advice. Fred tells him that Daphne wasn't his girlfriend; they were just 'hanging out'. He says that he doesn't think they're too serious and that he likes ""playing the field"". Meanwhile, Daphne is telling Velma about her relationship with Fred, and saying the exact opposite - that Fred's totally her boyfriend, and he doesn't like playing the field, and things were getting serious. They meet at the pool, where Daphne tells them that they're all invited to attend the opening party for the country club. While she and Fred take a swim, Shaggy takes a walk on the beach with Velma. He is struggling to say he likes her, but she isn't paying any attention. Velma is talking about the underwater caves when she finds a moonstone. She says she loves them, and Shaggy begins to tell her that her eyes are beautiful, when Velma suddenly gets nauseous. Shaggy tells her she needs to sit down and asks her if she's all right, but she just says she'll return to her cabin and lie down. Shaggy seems a bit shocked. That night at the party, a huge frog-like monster suddenly appears and wreaks havoc on everyone. After everyone leaves, Uncle Thorny tells the gang that almost half of members quit, and if someone doesn't do something, he might have to close down the club. The gang decides to help him solve the mystery. They decide to investigate the only person who has ever taken a picture of the lake monster, Mr. Uggins. He is also the lighthouse keeper. Shaggy suggests splitting and insists on going with Velma. They're walking on the beach, and she quotes an old song about the moon, which is says she loves. Shaggy is then sucked into a daydream when he is singing to Velma. However, he is interrupted when they see the lake monster. Meanwhile, Daphne is talking to Fred about how she thinks Shaggy likes Velma, when Fred says that Shaggy must have not followed his advice. Daphne begins to ask him what he means when they hear the screaming of Shaggy and Velma. The lake monster falls, and turns out to be Mr. Uggins, who said that he decided to take that picture to make a quick buck, but it wasn't him last night at the party. He then tells them the story of the lake monster: how when people were first settling Erie Point, an old woman named Wanda Grubwort warned them not to come onto her land. They paid no attention to her, so she used her magic staff - which used moonstones as the source of her power - to turn a frog into a horrible monster that attacked the villagers. Wanda was later tried for witchery and burnt at the stake. The next day, Daphne finds Shaggy writing ""Mr. Shaggy Dinkley"" and ""Mrs. Velma Rogers"" all over the napkins outside. He eats the napkin, saying that his doctor told him he needs more linen in his diet, and tells her that Fred is off putting with some girls. Daphne sees him hugging them and becomes jealous and angry, and when Fred comes up is very irritated with him, though she doesn't explain why. Shaggy then begins to ask them about dating advice for his friend ""Scruffy"", but then Velma appears, with important evidence. She shows them the security footage of the lake monster's attack last night, and it shows the lake monster meeting a mysteriously masked figure on the beach. They begin to zoom in on the figure to see its face, but Velma ""accidentally"" spills her green tea on the computer and destroys the footage. Depressed and ashamed, she walks away, though Shaggy tries to convince her to stay. He then admits that he likes her to Fred and Daphne. They start to give him advice, but they end up arguing about their relationship, and Shaggy lets it slip that Fred told him they had a ""loosey-goosey"" relationship. Daphne angrily storms away. Shaggy is pretending that Scooby Doo is Velma later that night. Scooby impatiently tries to do something familiar with Shaggy, by making a monstrous midnight snack, but Shaggy smells Velma's scent and drifts away to find her, leaving Scooby steaming mad. Meanwhile, Fred is out jogging when he sees Daphne playing tennis with a couple of boys - a plot to make Fred jealous. Fred is obviously annoyed, but before he can say anything, they hear Shaggy screaming. They run to find him and they also find the lake monster. Fred and Daphne run one way while Shaggy runs the other. He's cornered by the lake monster, but Scooby Doo rides over on a four-wheeler and saves him. He then crashes into a sand pit where Shaggy finds a moonstone, saying that Velma loves them. Meanwhile, Fred and Daphne are hiding by the golf carts - with Fred still trying to find out who those tennis players were while still seeming unjealous - when the lake monster appears. Fred tries to fight it, but they end running for their lives and crashing into Shaggy, who has become terrified that Velma has been eaten. The next morning, they find her unconscious on the beach. Daphne and Shaggy both thinks she's dead and starts crying, but Velma then wakes up. She says she was out walking when the fog rolled in. Shaggy begins to tell her that he was very worried, but stops when he notices warts on her hand. Velma looks surprised, but guiltily assures them that it's nothing. After they fill her in on the latest monster attack, Daphne says that she saw purple paint on the figure's cloak, and suggests they check out a boat that they saw on the way to Erie Point - . Shaggy doesn't agree and asks Velma out on a date, which she tolerantly says yes to. While Shaggy and Velma are on their date, Fred and Daphne go to see the boat. It is becoming more and more apparent that Fred didn't like Daphne playing with the boys - which Daphne seems to enjoy. On the boat they discover many old newspapers in a closet and learn that the moonstones in Wanda Grubwort's staff were scattered and buried many years ago, and that she had some children which were found in the caves that she lived in. They deduce that Wanda has descendants living in town, and they could be trying to get revenge for what the people did to her. The lake monster then appears and locks them in and turns the water pressure up, bursting the pipes and beginning to flood the closet. While Fred and Daphne desperately try to find a way out, they fight about their relationship problems and break up. Fred finally manages to save them when the water is up to their necks by breaking the closet window with part of the pipe, but Daphne is still furious at him and stomps away. Meanwhile, at Shaggy's date, things go well until he lights a match to light some candles. Velma flings herself back in terror, though she is unsure why. Shaggy calls out the waiter, who turns out to be Scooby Doo, who is angry at Shaggy for ignoring him lately and is trying to ruin the date. Scooby refuses to leave when Shaggy tries to bribe him and instead bites Shaggy, causing Shaggy to knock over the table and drop the moonstone on the ground that he was going to give to Velma as a surprise. When Velma sees the moonstone, she takes it and leaves mysteriously. When Fred and Daphne, soaking wet, get back to Shaggy's quarters, they find Scooby painting a line between his side of the room and Shaggy's side. Things are still very tense between them, but they share what they found out with Shaggy. They can't find Grubwort in the phone book until Shaggy points out that the name of the country store they stopped at, Trowburg's, is Grubwort spelled backwards. They drive to the home of the woman who own's Grubwort's. They see the witch's figure through the windows, but they don't split up, due to the strained relationship between Shaggy and Scooby and Fred and Daphne. The cloaked figure is seen to be a very warty Velma. However, she claims to not be Velma and attacks the gang, knocking them out for a moment. The gang wakes up later and fined Mrs. Grubwort, who says that her evil ancestor has possessed Velma. Shaggy is heartbroken, though Fred tries to sympathize, saying that he wasn't the only one whose first love was now an evil witch. The gang realizes that they missed all the little signs - the warts, Velma's fear of fire, her love of moonstones, and how she spilled the tea on the video of the witch because it was going to show her face - that should have proved Velma was up to something, but they were too absorbed with all their side problems. The woman says that Wanda probably would have gone to the caves. Shaggy, remembering a bit of information Velma had given him, points out that they're underwater, so the woman offers to rent them scuba gear. They arrive in the cave and while hiding, see Wanda turn several more frogs into monsters. Shaggy bursts out of hiding and commands Velma to stop. Wanda sets her monsters on the gang, and while Scooby, Fred and Daphne run for their lives, Shaggy stays back and tries to help Velma fight the witch. He briefly reaches her by telling her about his feelings, but Wanda takes over again and pins him to the wall. Meanwhile, Fred and Daphne reach a dead end. Both fearing that it's the end, they apologize for the fights that they had. The lake monsters then burst through the wall. At the same time, Shaggy tries once again to save Velma by singing her favorite song. Velma joins in, and manages to break free of the witch's control. The ghost of Wanda tries to grab her staff, but Scooby Doo arrives just in time and smashes it into a rock, destroying Wanda. Fred and Daphne, who are about to be killed and are clutching one another for dear life, see the monsters turn back into frogs, They run back to Shaggy, who is confessing how much he really likes Velma. Both Fred and Daphne impatiently tell him to just kiss her. Velma and Shaggy kiss, but afterwards both agree that they didn't feel a single spark, and it's better if they're just friends. Fred and Daphne agree as well that all of them are meant to be just friends. The next day, Uncle Thorny tells the gang that they are so many applications for membership that he wasn't sure if he could take everyone, and presents the gang with 10,000 dollars to take care of the damages done to the barn. He also says that he will call his attorney and see if the gang can incorporate, to take care of any future damages done. Daphne suggests Mystery Incorporated for their sleuthing group name and they all agree as they do a group hug- except for Scooby, who is still upset with Shaggy. He wanders away, but falls over the balcony railing and is caught by Shaggy, who assures Scooby that he'll always be there for him, and all is well."

It is a time of peace and the era of the samurai is waning. A sadistic young Lord Matsudaira Naritsugu rapes and kills at will. No one can touch him because he is the former shogun's son and current shogun's younger brother, and thus above the law. Sir Doi Toshitsura, a senior government official, realizes the situation will become more dangerous after Naritsugu ascends to a higher political position. After a wronged party publicly commits seppuku as a way of showing disdain for Lord Naritsugu, Sir Doi seeks out a trusted older samurai, Shinzaemon, a battle- hardened warrior who served under the former shogun, and secretly hires him to assassinate Naritsugu. However, men loyal to Naritsugu soon get wind of Sir Doi's plot, and move into action. By spying on Doi's meetings, they discover he has hired Shinazaemon. Meanwhile, Shinzaemon gathers 11 more samurai, whom Sir Doi knows can be trusted and are the strongest he knows, including his nephew Shinroukuro. The 12 plan to ambush Naritsugu on his long journey home from Edo. Before they leave, some members of the group are attacked by Hanbei's men but quickly defeat them. Shinzaemon is visited by his old sparring partner Hanbei: each tries to dissuade the other from his task in vain, with Shinzaemon saying they will meet again. In order to block Naritsugu's passage, several of the assassins are sent to buy the help of a town, and so force him to reroute to a remote village for their advantage. Shinzaemon and the others ride urgently towards the village they have chosen for the battle. On the way, they are encounter a few of Naritsugu's hired thugs, meant to slow them down while Naritsugu journeys home; they kill the thugs easily. They decide to travel stealthily through the mountains, where they meet a hunter named Kiga Koyata who leads them off the mountain and they adopt him as the thirteenth assassin. He helps them find the village they have chosen for the conflict, and they are reunited with their comrades. They take the village over and convert it into a labyrinthine mousetrap with many camouflaged fortifications. As they wait, one of the assassins out scouting the area returns with bad news; he claims that Naritsugu and his men have vanished after turning back from the blocked town. Some assassins plead with Shinzaemon to track down Naritsugu, but Shinzaemon who is always thinking ahead, tells them to wait it out; it's hard for Naritsugu and his 70 guards to hide easily. Therefore they must believe that their luck will hold out. Shinzaemon compares their attempt to catch Naritsugu to fishing; he says never reel your line in too fast, otherwise the fish will steal the bait and run away. It is better to wait till the fish swallows the bait and hook, and then reel him in at once. The next morning, their luck turns when the assassins discover that Naritsugu is heading toward the village. But when Naritsugu arrives, they discover they are outnumbered even more heavily than expected: there are over 200 guards that Hanbei has ordered from other areas, not the 70 they were expecting. Nonetheless, Shinzaemon tells the assassins that the bigger the enemy the better, and they must continue their mission. A lengthy battle follows, with Naritsugu and his guards trapped inside the village and attacked by the assassins with arrows, explosives, knives, and swords – with the exception of Koyata, who fights with rocks in slings. Naritsugu, who has led a life of luxury, is enthralled and excited by the violence, claiming it's the most fun he has had and wondering if it was like this during the sengoku period . Inevitably, the assassins fall one by one as they inflict devastating casualties on the guards until, at last, there is a one-to-one sword fight between Shinzaemon and Hanbei, each knowing the other's moves well. Naritsugu watches. As they are fighting on natural terrain and not in a dojo, Shinzaemon triumphs. He approaches Naritsugu, who is finally now unprotected. Shinzaemon tells Naritsugu that he is acting for the people, but Naritsugu tells him that both the people and Samurai have only one purpose and that is to serve their lord. Shizaemon tells Naritsugu that lords can't live without the support of the people, and that if a lord abuses his powers, the people will rise against him. Enraged, Naritsugu stabs him in the abdomen, Shinzaemon returns the thrust. Both are mortally wounded. Naritsugu crawls in the mud, experiencing fear and pain for the first time. He thanks Shinzaemon in his own way for showing him how the world can be so different from the luxuries he was bored with. Shinzaemon decapitates Naritsugu in a coup de grace. Shinzaemon collapses, telling his nephew Shinrokurô that their mission is finished and releasing him from his duty. After telling Shinrokurô that he is deemed worthy as a Samurai and that he must live his life as he sees fit, Shinzaemon dies. As Shinrokurō wanders through the carnage he discovers the hunter Koyata standing amid the chaos. Despite being impaled through the neck earlier by Naritsugu, Koyata has made what appears to be a miraculous recovery. Shinrokurō tells him that Naritusugu is dead and that now their mission is over, he planned to become the most successful bandit in Japan and travel to America to make love with the woman there, and Koyata says that he plans go back to the mountains to take his boss's woman as his own.

26868396	/m/0bdp8zj	The Sun Sets at Dawn	1950-11-01		71	"{""/m/02h40lc"": ""English Language""}"	"{""/m/09c7w0"": ""United States of America""}"	"{""/m/07s9rl0"": ""Drama"", ""/m/0hj3n01"": ""Crime Drama""}"	1840s Japan. It is a time of peace and the era of the samurai is waning. A sadistic young Lord Matsudaira Naritsugu rapes and kills at will. No one can touch him because he is the former shogun's son and current shogun's younger brother, and thus above the law. Sir Doi Toshitsura, a senior government official, realizes the situation will become more dangerous after Naritsugu ascends to a higher political position. After a wronged party publicly commits seppuku as a way of showing disdain for Lord Naritsugu, Sir Doi seeks out a trusted older samurai, Shinzaemon, a battle- hardened warrior who served under the former shogun, and secretly hires him to assassinate Naritsugu. However, men loyal to Naritsugu soon get wind of Sir Doi's plot, and move into action. By spying on Doi's meetings, they discover he has hired Shinazaemon. Meanwhile, Shinzaemon gathers 11 more samurai, whom Sir Doi knows can be trusted and are the strongest he knows, including his nephew Shinroukuro. The 12 plan to ambush Naritsugu on his long journey home from Edo. Before they leave, some members of the group are attacked by Hanbei's men but quickly defeat them. Shinzaemon is visited by his old sparring partner Hanbei: each tries to dissuade the other from his task in vain, with Shinzaemon saying they will meet again. In order to block Naritsugu's passage, several of the assassins are sent to buy the help of a town, and so force him to reroute to a remote village for their advantage. Shinzaemon and the others ride urgently towards the village they have chosen for the battle. On the way, they are encounter a few of Naritsugu's hired thugs, meant to slow them down while Naritsugu journeys home; they kill the thugs easily. They decide to travel stealthily through the mountains, where they meet a hunter named Kiga Koyata who leads them off the mountain and they adopt him as the thirteenth assassin. He helps them find the village they have chosen for the conflict, and they are reunited with their comrades. They take the village over and convert it into a labyrinthine mousetrap with many camouflaged fortifications. As they wait, one of the assassins out scouting the area returns with bad news; he claims that Naritsugu and his men have vanished after turning back from the blocked town. Some assassins plead with Shinzaemon to track down Naritsugu, but Shinzaemon who is always thinking ahead, tells them to wait it out; it's hard for Naritsugu and his 70 guards to hide easily. Therefore they must believe that their luck will hold out. Shinzaemon compares their attempt to catch Naritsugu to fishing; he says never reel your line in too fast, otherwise the fish will steal the bait and run away. It is better to wait till the fish swallows the bait and hook, and then reel him in at once. The next morning, their luck turns when the assassins discover that Naritsugu is heading toward the village. But when Naritsugu arrives, they discover they are outnumbered even more heavily than expected: there are over 200 guards that Hanbei has ordered from other areas, not the 70 they were expecting. Nonetheless, Shinzaemon tells the assassins that the bigger the enemy the better, and they must continue their mission. A lengthy battle follows, with Naritsugu and his guards trapped inside the village and attacked by the assassins with arrows, explosives, knives, and swords – with the exception of Koyata, who fights with rocks in slings. Naritsugu, who has led a life of luxury, is enthralled and excited by the violence, claiming it's the most fun he has had and wondering if it was like this during the sengoku period . Inevitably, the assassins fall one by one as they inflict devastating casualties on the guards until, at last, there is a one-to-one sword fight between Shinzaemon and Hanbei, each knowing the other's moves well. Naritsugu watches. As they are fighting on natural terrain and not in a dojo, Shinzaemon triumphs. He approaches Naritsugu, who is finally now unprotected. Shinzaemon tells Naritsugu that he is acting for the people, but Naritsugu tells him that both the people and Samurai have only one purpose and that is to serve their lord. Shizaemon tells Naritsugu that lords can't live without the support of the people, and that if a lord abuses his powers, the people will rise against him. Enraged, Naritsugu stabs him in the abdomen, Shinzaemon returns the thrust. Both are mortally wounded. Naritsugu crawls in the mud, experiencing fear and pain for the first time. He thanks Shinzaemon in his own way for showing him how the world can be so different from the luxuries he was bored with. Shinzaemon decapitates Naritsugu in a coup de grace. Shinzaemon collapses, telling his nephew Shinrokurô that their mission is finished and releasing him from his duty. After telling Shinrokurô that he is deemed worthy as a Samurai and that he must live his life as he sees fit, Shinzaemon dies. As Shinrokurō wanders through the carnage he discovers the hunter Koyata standing amid the chaos. Despite being impaled through the neck earlier by Naritsugu, Koyata has made what appears to be a miraculous recovery. Shinrokurō tells him that Naritusugu is dead and that now their mission is over, he planned to become the most successful bandit in Japan and travel to America to make love with the woman there, and Koyata says that he plans go back to the mountains to take his boss's woman as his own. Shinrokurō says tell her he said hi; Koyata promises that he will before happily hopping over the corpses as he leaves. Alone, Shinrokurō drags his sword behind him as he leaves the village. An epilogue states that the Shogun and the government covered up what really occurred, announcing that Naritsugu died of illness. 23 years later, the Shogunate falls and opens way for the Meiji Era.

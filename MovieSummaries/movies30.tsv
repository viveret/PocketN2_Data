Because of his size, his father doesn't care about him; only his mother does. A nasty tiger named Raja is curious of tasting an elephant and tries to attack Goliath, but Raja is stopped by his mother. Afterwards Eloise  almost accidentally steps on Goliath II. Later, he's nearly eaten by a crocodile (which appears to be the same one from [[Peter Pan , but his mother saves him. One day when the elephants are marching through the jungle, Goliath follows two snails but gets lost and his mother panics, causing the other elephants to crash (similar to the elephant crash in [[The Jungle Book . Goliath II's Mother and the Tiger, Raja, search for Goliath and manage to find him in a snail hole. After a short tug of war between Goliath's Mother and Raja, Goliath is rescued. Shortly afterwards, Goliath is scolded for disobeying his Mother's warnings on not wandering off and is put into a bird's nest as punishment. It is at this point that Goliath is now fed up with being treated like a baby  and feels confident that he can take care of himself. That night, while the herd is sleeping, Goliath runs away and vows never to return. Afterwards he is startled by various jungle noises and is again attacked by Raja after mistakenly waking him up with a cattail, and he walked on and crying for his Mother. After his mother hears his cries she goes to his aid and finds that he is being taken away by Raja. After saving Goliath from Raja's grasp, she grabs the tiger by his tail and throws him straight into the crocodile's mouth; he escapes from its belly and runs away, scared out of his wits, never to be seen again. Afterwards, Goliath gets a spanking from his mother for trying to desert the herd, because a deserter from the herd is granted a rogue and a traitor. The next day, while the elephants are marching through the jungle again, Goliath I screams because of a 6&nbsp;inch mouse, stopping,and causing the elephants to crash again. The mouse scares away and panics the herd, which flee and jump into a river, scaring the crocodile out of his wits, shaking a tree belonging to an owl along with the owl, and provoking the mother bird again. While the mouse is laughing hysterically at the elephants' misfortune, he finds Goliath II, staring at him. Shocked, he asks Goliath if he is afraid, but Goliath replies that he is not as they are the same size. Enraged, the mouse points out that Goliath is an elephant, and adds that elephants are afraid of mice as he deliberately pulls on his Trunk, flaps his ears, and kicks his ""Baggy Pants"" and threatens Goliath by telling him that if he doesn't run away until he counts 3, he will hurt him. After the mouse counts 3, a tussle starts between the two as Goliath I and Mother watch. The fight ends with Goliath holding the mouse over a cliff, where below is the waiting hungry crocodile. Not wanting to become the crocodile's next meal, the mouse cowardly begs Goliath not to drop him and tells him that he  is the champ. Goliath agrees and spares the mouse. After this, Goliath is respected by his father and is named the top elephant of the herd."

They were once the scariest of monsters, but now they have become associated with ""fun."" The three end up on a TV show called Foolish Monster Tricks, which is witnessed by three new modern monsters who decide to have them thrown out of the Ghoul Guild. They are then called before the Court of Horrors just before Halloween for ""failure to scare"". The Prosecutor  presents evidence that they are inept as monsters  but the jury ends up deadlocked, so the Judge says that they must prove that they can still be scary, and if they fail they will be sentenced to an eternity of entertaining at children's parties. They are given 24 hours to terrify a typical family, the Tinklemeisters: cleaning-obsessed Mom, overworked dog-groomer Dad, average daughter Stella, and youngest child Spike, who was struck by a bolt of lightning as a child. Since then, he has never spoken, and only whistles to communicate, and has developed a bizarre knack for weird experiments. The three monsters first attempt to scare them by cutting into their TV reception and showing their old horror films, but that attempt fails miserably, so they go with Plan B: they stage a fake game show, and make it seem that the Tinklemeisters have won a one-night stay at their castle. The monsters then scare the Tinklemeisters one by one: first Dad, Then Mom, then Stella. when the monsters try to scare Spike, he easily defeats all three of them, and then frees his family, who have been locked in a closet. the monsters then call a truce with the Tinklemeisters and explain their situation. Then, the three modern monsters show up and reveal that they were sent by the Prosecutor, who is unwilling to risk losing the case. Frank, Wolf, Drac and the Tinklemeisters escape, and then the Tinklemeisters and Spike use all of their skills to revamp the monsters and restore their youth and all their abilities, using a potion created by Spike to turn everything black and white, fully recreating the monster's glory days. then, the three new monsters arrive, and after a brief battle, Frank, Wolf, and Drac easily defeat them, but run out of time in the process. the next day, with the Tinklemeisters watching on TV, the Prosecutor claims that since the threesome didn't scare the Tinklemeisters, they should be sentenced immediately. However, the Judge tells the Prosecutor that the threesome did something better than scaring a typical family-scaring three of their own kind! Spike then shows up as a surprise witness, and reveals that since he read so many horror comics, he became an expert on monsters, but was too scared to speak for several years. he then delivers a passionate speech which convinces the Judge to reinstate the monsters into the Ghoul Guild. the monsters are then inducted into the Monster Hall of Fame, give their castle to the Tinklemeisters, and open a theme park on the castle grounds, which they use as a new way to haunt the population for fun."

A man named Bobby also enters the party, though he is out of place in the well dressed group. A man tries to make him leave, but Bobby claims to have an appointment with Cissy. When Cissy shows up, Bobby says he has a business opportunity for him, a dry cleaning store. Cissy's goons laugh at him, but Cissy gives Bobby some chips and tells him to have fun, eat, and then they'll talk. Bobby notices a station wagon entering the garage. In the garage, the man in the station wagon opens the back to reveal a Doberman Pinscher, muzzled, in a small metal cage. Back at the party, Bobby snacks until Cissy comes to visit. Bobby tries again to get him to consider the business, but Cissy only asks if he is drinking, which Bobby denies. Cissy leads him downstairs where the other party goers are gathering. A white pit bull is on one side being held by a man, while the doberman's cage is on the other. Cissy begins the fight and the dogs are released. The doberman is seriously wounded during the fight and is, later that night, thrown into the river by his owner. The dog awakens from his stupor and struggles desperately to swim.

At Cissy's place, Cissy complains that Bobby has been on time all day and even refused a drink, obviously expecting that Bobby would mess up. Cissy thinks Baby is too much for Bobby to raise and sends two of his goons to go pick up Bobby and make sure he is a few hundred short on the money. Bobby asks what's going on and they pretend to check the receipts while refusing to tell him where they are going. They take him out to a remote bridge area, accuse him of being short, and drag him out of the car where the proceed to beat him. Bobby manages to fight them off. Bobby gets to a phone and calls Baby.

The dog continues to follow. Bobby and Baby arrive at George's house where they are greeted warmly. Bobby tells him that he plans to live there and get a job, but they start to argue when George realizes Bobby has no firm plans.

Cissy tells him they just want the money and reminds him that they know where George lives. The girl suggests going back to George, but Bobby refuses. Bobby tells her he's going to take her to George's and leave her there while he gets himself together. He calls George, and apologizes about the fight, confused about why George is so mad. After George explains, Bobby hangs up to realize the girl has left. He searches for her, even calling George again. The dog arrives at the same bridge the girl stood on a few nights ago, and picks up her scent. He follows it through the city, but finds a crying, drunken Bobby instead.

While Bobby sleeps, Cissy is on the phone ordering a dog to fight the doberman. Back at the bridge, Baby is crying over the doberman, where Bobby finds her. She tells him she's worried and that she loves him. Bobby tells her he has a plan and reminds her of what she used to do when she was little and he and Brenda were fighting. The next day they take the dog to the location for the fight. Bobby leaves Baby outside and tells her he loves her, and tells her to remember ""when the bell rings."" The doberman is pitted against a huge mastiff-looking dog. When the bell rings, the girl runs in crying Bobby's name. The crowd's cheers die down and she begs Bobby to make them stop hurting her dog. They stop the fight and break up the dog, and the doberman runs over to the girl. As the crowd quietly stares at Cissy, Bobby walks across the ring and knocks Cissy into the ring, where the doberman attacks him. It rips his coat and pants before getting a hold of Cissy's neck.

They take him out to a remote bridge area, accuse him of being short, and drag him out of the car where the proceed to beat him. Bobby manages to fight them off. Bobby gets to a phone and calls Baby. He tells her they are taking a trip and to pack a bag very quickly, then meet him at the steps of the park. She comes, with the dog. Bobby hustles her into the car with the bag, but refuses to allow her to bring the dog. She refuses to come, and he relents but abandons the dog in a junkyard. At a truck stop, Bobby explains that they are going to Los Angeles and lies and says that Cissy loaned it to him for the trip. As they leave, the girl drops her glove in the parking lot. Back in Chicago, Cissy and his men are tearing up Bobby's apartment where they find a letter from Bobby's brother. Cissy says he'll let Bobby think he got away with it for a while. Late that night, the dog arrives at the truck stop and finds the girl's glove, which he grabs and plays with before continuing his trek. While filling up the gas tank, Bobby asks if he should call George. The girl says he should. While he makes the call, the girl goes to the side of the gas station and leaves a sock on the road. On the phone, Bobby tells George he'll be in L.A. that he'll be there in the morning and gets an invitation to come over, though after hanging up the phone its obvious George isn't happy about the news. Bobby sees Baby putting the sock on the road and tries to take it back, but the girl tells him it's a good luck symbol and spins a tale about Indians doing it on their journey. Bobby helps her by putting rocks on it to keep the wind from blowing it. As they head back to the car, Bobby mentions that L.A. has good schools and they can get her enrolled in one. The dog continues to follow. Bobby and Baby arrive at George's house where they are greeted warmly. Bobby tells him that he plans to live there and get a job, but they start to argue when George realizes Bobby has no firm plans. The dog stops in the barn of a small ranch, where the owner and its dog find him. The man notices the dog's nails are worn down almost to his paws, so he treats them while his dog warms up the doberman. The next morning, the dog sets off again, arriving in Los Angeles the next morning. George tells Bobby he has a contractor friend who might have a job for Bobby. Bobby and George end up in another argument which ends when George leave Bobby on the side of a freeway. When he gets back to the house, Bobby barks at the girl to get her things because they are leaving. Baby asks Bobby about the money again, but he refuses to talk about it. They drive to a motel, but someone steals their car, along with the money. As George and his family eat dinner, Cissy's two goons show up asking where Bobby is. George tells him he doesn't know where Bobby is, so Cissy leaves his number and tells him to call if Bobby contacts him. Cissy tells him they just want the money and reminds him that they know where George lives. The girl suggests going back to George, but Bobby refuses. Bobby tells her he's going to take her to George's and leave her there while he gets himself together. He calls George, and apologizes about the fight, confused about why George is so mad. After George explains, Bobby hangs up to realize the girl has left. He searches for her, even calling George again. The dog arrives at the same bridge the girl stood on a few nights ago, and picks up her scent. He follows it through the city, but finds a crying, drunken Bobby instead. The dog leads him to the girl back at the bridge where she ecstatically greets the dog. Bobby, still crying, hugs her and apologizes. They go back to George's where the brothers hug. While the girl plays outside, Bobby explains everything to George. Cissy's goons beat Bobby up badly. Cissy offers Baby anything she wants if she goes back to Chicago. She goes over to Bobby in answer. As Cissy goes to leave the room, Cissy is confronted by the dog. Cissy doesn't believe it's the same dog that lost the fight, but when the girl says the dog followed them from Chicago, he decides that he wants the dog to fight again. Cissy tells Bobby its his chance to get out of the situation in one piece. Baby treats Bobby's wounds while the dog looks on. While Bobby sleeps, Cissy is on the phone ordering a dog to fight the doberman. Back at the bridge, Baby is crying over the doberman, where Bobby finds her. She tells him she's worried and that she loves him. Bobby tells her he has a plan and reminds her of what she used to do when she was little and he and Brenda were fighting. The next day they take the dog to the location for the fight. Bobby leaves Baby outside and tells her he loves her, and tells her to remember ""when the bell rings."" The doberman is pitted against a huge mastiff-looking dog. When the bell rings, the girl runs in crying Bobby's name. The crowd's cheers die down and she begs Bobby to make them stop hurting her dog. They stop the fight and break up the dog, and the doberman runs over to the girl. As the crowd quietly stares at Cissy, Bobby walks across the ring and knocks Cissy into the ring, where the doberman attacks him. It rips his coat and pants before getting a hold of Cissy's neck. Bobby stands over Cissy and tells him ""it's over."" When Cissy agrees, the dog lets go. Bobby and Baby leave with the dog as Cissy's goons help him up."

A man named Bobby also enters the party, though he is out of place in the well dressed group. A man tries to make him leave, but Bobby claims to have an appointment with Cissy. When Cissy shows up, Bobby says he has a business opportunity for him, a dry cleaning store. Cissy's goons laugh at him, but Cissy gives Bobby some chips and tells him to have fun, eat, and then they'll talk. Bobby notices a station wagon entering the garage. In the garage, the man in the station wagon opens the back to reveal a Doberman Pinscher, muzzled, in a small metal cage. Back at the party, Bobby snacks until Cissy comes to visit. Bobby tries again to get him to consider the business, but Cissy only asks if he is drinking, which Bobby denies. Cissy leads him downstairs where the other party goers are gathering. A white pit bull is on one side being held by a man, while the doberman's cage is on the other. Cissy begins the fight and the dogs are released. The doberman is seriously wounded during the fight and is, later that night, thrown into the river by his owner. The dog awakens from his stupor and struggles desperately to swim. The next morning, Baby takes money from an envelope hidden in the headboard of a bed, and buys a cigarette lighter, which she has giftwrapped. Back at the house she decorates a misshapen cake with M&M's. Bobby discovers the missing money, and yells at her for stealing the money, then takes her back to the store to return the lighter and takes her to dinner. They arrive home to find Cissy and some of his goons waiting in their apartment. Bobby complains about Cissy breaking in, but Cissy says he got a key from his sister and questions whether Brenda was really happy in such a dump. Cissy tells him to come by and he might have something for him. Baby finds the Doberman, shivering and whimpering in pain. She cares for him as best she can, and he follows her home, and from there into a subway station, where he is captured by animal control employees. Baby finds where the dog was taken, but animal control says they can't release him because of a complaint. Baby distracts the worker by dropping some money, and quietly lifts the latch on the kennel, then leaves. That night, the dog escapes the pound and finds his way back to Baby. In the morning, Bobby recognizes it as the fighting dog he saw at Cissy's and demands she gets rid it. He goes to Cissy, where he is offered a job doing pickups with car included. Bobby accepts. Cissy seems to blame Bobby for his sister's death, but Bobby said her problems started long before they got together. Baby returns the dog to where she found it, but it gets back to the apartment before she does. Bobby goes out to do his pick ups. At Cissy's place, Cissy complains that Bobby has been on time all day and even refused a drink, obviously expecting that Bobby would mess up. Cissy thinks Baby is too much for Bobby to raise and sends two of his goons to go pick up Bobby and make sure he is a few hundred short on the money.

Nevers agrees and quickly dispatches the upstart whom he soon befriends. Nevers learns that he has a ""son"" by Blanche de Caylus—a fact previously concealed by his cousin and would-be heir, the wicked Comte de Gonzague . That night Nevers escapes an assassination attempt by Gonzague's men. Determined to claim his bride, Nevers leaves for Caylus with Lagardère along as his escort. They are followed by Gonzague and his men who plan to murder Nevers before he can marry Blanche and claim his son and heir. Along the way Nevers teaches Lagardère the ""Nevers Attack""—an acrobatic sleight of hand that ends with a blade between the opponent's eyes. Soonafter, they spot the assassins, and Lagardère is able to delay the attackers long enough to allow Nevers to reach Caylus and marry Blanche. The newlyweds' happiness, however, is short-lived. When Gonzague and his men arrive at Caylus, they murder the entire wedding party. Lagardère arrives, and after a lengthy swordfight, Nevers is fatally stabbed by a masked Gonzague, who is ""branded"" on the hand by Lagardère. With his dying breath, Nevers implores Lagardère to avenge him and look after his infant child. Lagardère flees Caylus with the infant and finds refuge in the mountains in an abandoned farmhouse, where he discovers that the ""son"" is in fact a girl named Aurore. Gonzague's men track Lagardère to his mountain hideaway looking to kill Nevers' rightful heir. Lagardère and Aurore escape with the help of a band of strolling players who convince the pursuing killers that Lagardère and Aurore have plunged to their deaths in a mountain torrent. After Gonzague's men leave, Lagardère and Aurore join up with the strolling players. Back in Nevers, after attending the funeral of her daughter—the coffin actually contains a wax doll—Blanche retires to a convent, and the evil Gonzague is named executor of her estate. Sixteen years later, Lagardère and Aurore  are still with the players. After witnessing Lagardère defend her against three outlaws using sophisticated swordplay with a stick, Aurore asks about his past. Lagardère keeps his past hidden, but he teaches her the ""Nevers Attack"". One night after a performance, Aurore is taken to a party given by one of Gonzague's men, Louis-Joseph, and is soon assaulted by the host. Using fencing skills she learned from her father, Aurore escapes her attacker, killing him using the ""Nevers Attack"". When Gonzague learns how his ""finest blade"" was killed, he suspects that Aurore is still alive; his suspicions are confirmed when Aurore's tomb is opened revealing a decayed wax doll. Gonzague then orders his men to find and kill her. Lagardère sets out to plan his revenge on Gonzague. After revealing to Aurore that she is the daughter of the late Duke of Nevers, he gains employment as Gonzague's secretary disguised as a hunchback, makes contact with Blanche revealing that her daughter is alive, and then engineers a stock market raid on shares in the Mississippi Company supposedly on behalf of Gonzague—in fact he purchases the stock using gold provided by Blanche for her daughter's benefit. When Aurore is captured by Gonzague's men, Lagardère executes a daring rescue. That night, the Regent Philippe d'Orléans arrives prepared to name Gonzague a royal agent to the Louisiana Territory.

Its inhabitants include two security guards, two scientists and six prisoners whose crimes were so severe that they volunteered to live under experimentation rather than face death penalties. One day, a shuttle arrives with a new scientist named Elisa. Her passenger is a man of unknown origins, who wakes up severely disoriented, unable to speak, and often falls into blank stares at what he sees as a bright, shimmering light. He seems to be aware of his surroundings, though, but is unable — or unwilling — to interact with them for the most part. He is introduced to the prisoners: their leader César, his right hand man Lazare, the large Moloch, the socially reclusive Bouddha, Raspoutine, a religious man who believes in repentance with God and the only one who sides with Saint George in the beginning, and Attila, a computer hacker. Raspoutine claims that the new one was sent by God to save the lot of them, calling him ""Saint George, the Dragonslayer"", because of a tattoo ""George"" has. Elisa and the station's head researcher, Perséphone, are at odds over their research methods. Meanwhile, the arrival prompts the station's commander Charon to work with Attila in hacking into Elisa's files and finding out what she is really there for. Much to Attila's horror, her experiments authorize her to kill all of them for the sake of the research. Meanwhile, Bouddha's self-righteous killing pattern takes effect when he sees George in great pain, and attempts to strangle him in order to alleviate his suffering. This leads to infighting amongst the other prisoners, and the wardens use gas to knock them out. Bouddha becomes Elisa's first experiment. She injects him with nanotechnology and returns him to the prison hold. Bouddha's own unbearable pain from the nanites bonding with his DNA summons George, who is somehow able to remove them from him  and Bouddha becomes well again. Bouddha then becomes as convinced as Raspoutine that Saint George is a miracle worker and befriends him, swearing to protect George. Moloch attempts to attack George. In the fight, Moloch pulls a knife, and Raspoutine's struggle with him causes Moloch to accidentally slit his own throat. Gas pours in to knock the group out, but not before George runs over to assist Moloch. The prison guards discover, to their amazement, that Moloch has no wound on his throat, and is alive and well, although unconscious. On their way out they inject César with the nanotechnology as they did for Bouddha and depart. Perséphone's assumption that George is a miracle worker is scoffed at by Elisa, but Moloch's doubts prompt César to await an impending usurping of his authority, and he plots to get rid of George. However, César's sudden bouts of pain and illness from the nanotechnology render him unable to take care of George himself, and Lazare and Moloch are sent in his stead. Meanwhile, Charon is contacted by Attila and learns that Attila has locked all of the main computer systems in an attempt to resist their eventual sacrifice. While Bouddha and Raspoutine are distracted, George is attacked by Lazare, and stabbed several times in the chest and abdomen. During experiments on George's corpse, Perséphone has doubts about Elisa's methods, but she is overruled by Elisa and Charon. Before Elisa can continue with her experiments, George, who is supposedly dead, wakes up completely healed, grabs Elisa and uses her as a hostage to reach the prison quarters before releasing her. César is in severe pain from the nanomachines, and George cures him. Attila appears and tells the others of his plans to destroy them all out of spite, by making the space station crash into Dante. Objecting to this, the prisoners subdue Attila while George attempts to cure him, but Attila manages to break free and runs away. César and his crew attempt to catch Attila; they eventually find him, only to see that he has hanged himself. With Attila dead, their plans for stopping the station's decaying orbit require the scientific personnel and the prisoners to work together, since the mechanism necessary to stop the decaying orbit is located under a trapdoor below the prisoner's quarters. The prisoners agree, and while Charon and Perséphone lead the security to the prisoner's area, they leave Elisa alone to man the controls. As the station inhabitants work to open the hatch to the manual control unit, the gas goes off, knocking out the lot of them. Elisa preps and attempts to escape via shuttle, but Lazare, who had to hold his breath during gas emission, forces her into letting him escape with her. As the others awaken, one of the guards goes to check on the shuttle, and finds that as part of his meddling, Attila had also locked the shuttle controls — as a result, Elisa and Lazare are killed when the shuttle crash lands on the planet below. Opening the panel, the group finds that the hatch to the override room is filled to the top with boiling water. César realizes he is the only one who can properly fit into the little space, and is wrapped in some protective fabrics, covered with cold water and jumps in. He loses his protective goggles on the short trip, and emerges on the other side horribly burned and dies in the compartment before entering the six digit code necessary to reset the control computer. Though dead, he indirectly managed to enable their escape from the planet's orbit: in a strange epilogue, Saint George emerges from the station in a space suit and floats above the planet on thin air — he could not save the station, so he changed the context, suddenly using the full extent of his strange and inexplicable powers  to terraform Dante into a livable planet, while his body disintegrated in space as a result."

He is introduced to the prisoners: their leader César, his right hand man Lazare, the large Moloch, the socially reclusive Bouddha, Raspoutine, a religious man who believes in repentance with God and the only one who sides with Saint George in the beginning, and Attila, a computer hacker. Raspoutine claims that the new one was sent by God to save the lot of them, calling him ""Saint George, the Dragonslayer"", because of a tattoo ""George"" has. Elisa and the station's head researcher, Perséphone, are at odds over their research methods. Meanwhile, the arrival prompts the station's commander Charon to work with Attila in hacking into Elisa's files and finding out what she is really there for. Much to Attila's horror, her experiments authorize her to kill all of them for the sake of the research. Meanwhile, Bouddha's self-righteous killing pattern takes effect when he sees George in great pain, and attempts to strangle him in order to alleviate his suffering. This leads to infighting amongst the other prisoners, and the wardens use gas to knock them out. Bouddha becomes Elisa's first experiment. She injects him with nanotechnology and returns him to the prison hold. Bouddha's own unbearable pain from the nanites bonding with his DNA summons George, who is somehow able to remove them from him  and Bouddha becomes well again. Bouddha then becomes as convinced as Raspoutine that Saint George is a miracle worker and befriends him, swearing to protect George. Moloch attempts to attack George. In the fight, Moloch pulls a knife, and Raspoutine's struggle with him causes Moloch to accidentally slit his own throat. Gas pours in to knock the group out, but not before George runs over to assist Moloch. The prison guards discover, to their amazement, that Moloch has no wound on his throat, and is alive and well, although unconscious. On their way out they inject César with the nanotechnology as they did for Bouddha and depart. Perséphone's assumption that George is a miracle worker is scoffed at by Elisa, but Moloch's doubts prompt César to await an impending usurping of his authority, and he plots to get rid of George. However, César's sudden bouts of pain and illness from the nanotechnology render him unable to take care of George himself, and Lazare and Moloch are sent in his stead. Meanwhile, Charon is contacted by Attila and learns that Attila has locked all of the main computer systems in an attempt to resist their eventual sacrifice. While Bouddha and Raspoutine are distracted, George is attacked by Lazare, and stabbed several times in the chest and abdomen. During experiments on George's corpse, Perséphone has doubts about Elisa's methods, but she is overruled by Elisa and Charon. Before Elisa can continue with her experiments, George, who is supposedly dead, wakes up completely healed, grabs Elisa and uses her as a hostage to reach the prison quarters before releasing her. César is in severe pain from the nanomachines, and George cures him. Attila appears and tells the others of his plans to destroy them all out of spite, by making the space station crash into Dante. Objecting to this, the prisoners subdue Attila while George attempts to cure him, but Attila manages to break free and runs away. César and his crew attempt to catch Attila; they eventually find him, only to see that he has hanged himself. With Attila dead, their plans for stopping the station's decaying orbit require the scientific personnel and the prisoners to work together, since the mechanism necessary to stop the decaying orbit is located under a trapdoor below the prisoner's quarters. The prisoners agree, and while Charon and Perséphone lead the security to the prisoner's area, they leave Elisa alone to man the controls. As the station inhabitants work to open the hatch to the manual control unit, the gas goes off, knocking out the lot of them. Elisa preps and attempts to escape via shuttle, but Lazare, who had to hold his breath during gas emission, forces her into letting him escape with her. As the others awaken, one of the guards goes to check on the shuttle, and finds that as part of his meddling, Attila had also locked the shuttle controls — as a result, Elisa and Lazare are killed when the shuttle crash lands on the planet below. Opening the panel, the group finds that the hatch to the override room is filled to the top with boiling water. César realizes he is the only one who can properly fit into the little space, and is wrapped in some protective fabrics, covered with cold water and jumps in. He loses his protective goggles on the short trip, and emerges on the other side horribly burned and dies in the compartment before entering the six digit code necessary to reset the control computer. Though dead, he indirectly managed to enable their escape from the planet's orbit: in a strange epilogue, Saint George emerges from the station in a space suit and floats above the planet on thin air — he could not save the station, so he changed the context, suddenly using the full extent of his strange and inexplicable powers  to terraform Dante into a livable planet, while his body disintegrated in space as a result."

His obsession unnerves his crew so badly that they all desert the ship. Shortly afterward, the captain finds Tom searching for food in the harbor, knocks him out, and takes him aboard. Tom believes at first that he is going on a cruise, but the captain soon puts him to work scrubbing the deck. As Tom works, he sees Jerry set up a beach chair outside his hole. He grabs Jerry and scrubs away all his color, leaving the mouse visible only as an outline. Jerry returns to his hole to get his color back, switches Tom's water bucket for one filled with tar, and tricks him into scrubbing with it. Tom chases Jerry across the deck, only to get the entire bucket of tar dumped on his head; he briefly poses as the captain's shadow to avoid being spotted, then gets wiped clean when the captain throws a door open, smashing him into the wall. Next Tom spots Jerry lounging in the rigging and tries to shake him loose by undoing the knots. One of the heavy blocks swings loose and knocks Tom into a barrel of harpoons, leaving his nose stuck in one of them as the captain grabs it and throws for target practice. Jerry tricks Tom into stabbing his own tail with the harpoon and dropping an anvil on his own head, which sends Tom crashing through the ship's hull and into the ocean. With the help of a rope thrown by Jerry, Tom climbs aboard as the captain sights Dicky Moe and fires a harpoon gun. Tom realizes too late that he is holding the free end of the harpoon's rope, and he is yanked off the ship. As the whale swims off, with Tom tied to him by the rope, the captain yells for him to come back and Jerry settles down with a book and taunts him.

The items in the kit include the following: *Tom  *Jerry  *A hammer, knife, and stick of dynamite  *Coffee and cigarettes  *A slice of watermelon The narrator points out, ""The result may not make sense, but it will last long enough for you to be comfortably seated before the feature begins."" This statement refers to the original theatrical exhibition of the cartoon, in which it ran ahead of a feature film. At first, the kit is set up by having Jerry eat the watermelon. He spits the seeds out, hitting and waking Tom, who initially grabs the hammer to hit Jerry but instead flicks him in the back of the head. This causes Jerry to swallow his mouthful of seeds, whereupon he starts dancing and shaking his body to make maraca sounds. Tom catches him in a metal can and uses him as a shaker for his own dance; when the effect suddenly stops, Tom peeks in and gets a mouthful of seeds spat into his face. He devours the rest of the watermelon and turns his head into a cannon to fire blasts of seeds at Jerry, who takes cover in the kit box just before Tom hits it, destroying the stick of dynamite. Jerry winds up lying beneath a book entitled Judo for Mice, studies it, and emerges with enough fighting skill to easily overpower Tom. Even a stint of training at a boxing gym and use of the knife do not give Tom any advantage against Jerry. Finally Tom goes to a judo school in order to face him again. The two have a breaking contest, with each trying to outdo the other. The contest ends abruptly when Tom tries to break a huge block of marble, which crashes through the floor and takes him with it. The unconscious Tom ends up in the battered box. Jerry replaces the lid as the narrator explains, ""Our next film will be for the kiddies, and will demonstrate a new poison gas. Thank you and good night."" The music winds to a stop as if it were being played on a slowing phonograph record, and Jerry bows to the audience in typical Japanese fashion."

LK's family - his spinster twin sister Prerna , his two sons Ranjeet and Sameer , their wives Shruti and Anju  respectively and Ranjeet's daughters Sanjana and Namrata, and Sameer's son, Pawan, can't stop salivating at the thought of all that money. Unfortunately for all of them fate displays a wicked sense of humour. On the night before the IPO opens, LK dies while copulating with a starlet Kim , who's aspiring to become the heroine of a film that LK plans to produce. The family is distraught and horrified. Not because a loved one has died but because now no one will buy their shares. So, on the advice of their family guru - Vidyut Baba , the family decides to hide the death of LK for a period of two days till the shares are all sold out. Little do they realize the crazy series of events that will follow on account of this duplicity. After all, hiding the death of a man as famous as LK is a Herculean task. To make matters worse, every time they're ready to announce LK's death, fate intervenes forcing them to keep his death hidden for another couple of days. This results in them having to announce the death of a fictitious friend or relative of LK and stage fake funerals. Which of course means generating dead bodies and, worse, getting the dead LK to make appearances at these funerals.

Meanwhile, Shinji Ikari and his father Gendo visit Yui's grave, with the Seventh Angel attacking shortly before is dispatched by the newly arrived Unit-02 and its headstrong pilot, Asuka Langley Shikinami. Chief Inspector Ryoji Kaji, present at the battle with Unit-05 and arriving alongside Unit-02, delivers a suitcase to Gendo containing an object referred to as the ""Key of Nebuchadnezzar"" and notes that the destruction of Unit-05 went as planned. Later Shinji, Asuka, and Rei kill the Eighth Angel in a devised haphazard plan by Misato Katsuragi. Both Unit-00 and Unit-01 are damaged, but SEELE orders only the latter be repaired, as the former is no longer needed. Gendo and Kozo Fuyutsuki visit Tabgha Base on the Moon to view SEELE's progress on the mysterious ""Evangelion Mark.06."" Though they are denied landing, they confirm that its construction is different from the other EVAs and briefly see Kaworu Nagisa sitting on its finger. On Earth, Shinji decides to cook an extra lunch for Rei who asks Gendo for permission to host a dinner party but he initially refuses before remembering Yui's request to take care of Shinji. Rei invites everyone to her home for a cooked meal, with the intention of helping repair Gendo and Shinji's relationship. Mari arrives in Tokyo-3 by parachute, rather than in the covert manner she intended, landing on Shinji in the process. Soon, Evangelion Unit-04 and NERV's U.S. branch are destroyed during a test of an experimental engine, prompting the U.S. government to send the completed Unit-03 to Tokyo-3. In accordance with the ""Vatican Treaty"", where no nation is allowed to possess more than three functioning Evangelions at a time, NERV decides to seal Unit-02. Rei refuses to pilot the new Eva, which is to be tested on the same day as her planned dinner, with Asuka realizing how much Rei likes Shinji. Asuka volunteers to take her place before the Ninth Angel possesses the activation of Unit-03 and Shinji inside NERV's only functional EVA Unit-01 refuses to fight for fear of harming Asuka, who is still trapped inside. Gendo orders the activation of the dummy system causing the autonomous Unit-01 to savagely kill the Angel, crushing the entry plug in its teeth. Shinji is distraught over his father's actions and leaves NERV. Asuka survives, but is grievously injured and placed in quarantine for mental contamination fear by the Angel. As Shinji heads out of the city on a train, the Tenth Angel attacks. Gendo fails to activate Unit-01, as it rejects the dummy system. Mari hijacks Unit-02 and heads out to fight Zeruel, activating Unit-02s second best mode ""The Beast"", that removes the unit's restraints. In this mode, she successfully smashes through most of Zeruels multiple AT Fields, but is still taken out by the Angels rapid extending blade-like arms. Then, Rei's damaged Unit-00 emerges on the battlefield and charges at Zeruel with an N² mine-armed missile. Rei attempts to neutralize Zeruel's AT Fields, but cannot on her own. The battered Unit-02 makes a last attack, tearing through the Angels remaining AT Fields with her teeth. Unit-00 throws Unit-02 out of the blast radius before the missile detonates. It fails to destroy Zeruel, and blows off Unit-00s arms in the process. Mari sees Shinji upon fleeing in the damaged Unit-02 and takes him to safety as the Angel consumes Unit-00, growing the body of a giant woman with its original one as the head. Once Shinji runs back and tells Gendo to let him pilot Unit-01, Zeruel easily breaks into the command center, bypassing NERV's auto-self destruct security measures by changing to Unit-00s blood pattern. Shinji fends it off and takes the fight back to the Geofront, but Unit-01 runs out of power and shuts down. The Angel throws Unit-01 into the side of a mountain, impaling it. Enraged and determined to save Rei no matter the cost, Shinji reactivates Unit-01 in berserker mode, glowing red with a halo over its head to take down the Angel to reveal its core, and reaches inside its core to try to save Rei. Shinji's willpower causes Unit-01 to start floating up into the air, taking the Angel up with it. The Halo above Unit-01's head expands to the size of a cyclone, making the sky glow red, and sweeping up debris all around them. Unit-01 presses its hands against the Angel's core, attempting to grant Shinji's wish, and starts transcending the boundaries of humanity. Inside the cockpit, Shinji sees Rei beyond him, floating huddled up and alone under a liquid-like surface. He climbs forward, reaching out for her through the surface taking hands and pulls out of the liquid and into his cockpit while Unit-01 pulls Unit-00's core out of the Angels core, moments before it collapses, as the Angel explodes into blood which combines with Unit-00's core, taking form of a giant Rei which is absorbed into Unit-01's core. Unit-01 sprouts giant wings of light, and Misato sees that they are identical to the ones she saw during Second Impact fifteen years ago. Ritsuko notes that the EVA is transcending humanity as a divine being, beginning Third Impact, and Apocalypse. In a post-credits scene, the Lance of Longinus in Earth neutralizes Unit-01, stopping Third Impact. Kaworu descends from the Moon in Mark.06, saying that he will make Shinji happy."

His wife, Katie  gets a recipe for applesauce wrong and gives it to her husband to take to work for lunch, hoping it will help cut down on the budget. In a humorous chain reaction, the duck Albert is testing steals the applesauce after Albert has thrown it away in the trash, and then wanders into a radiation lab and becomes irradiated. Albert is ordered to get rid of the duck, so he figures he can give it to his son, Jimmy  who has been wanting a pet, only to discover it now lays golden eggs. In a Pavlovian manner, the duck, named ""Charlie"" , lays an egg when prompted by the barking of a dog. At first, the only ones who know of Charlie's golden yolks are Albert, Katie, Jimmy and Albert's friend, Fred, but as they sell the yolks of gold, they gain the attention of a suspicious neighbor, a government bureaucrat from the US Treasury Department named Mr. Hooper ([[Joe Flynn , who starts spying on them  his wife gets angry, and ultimately convinces his boss, Rutledge ([[James Gregory , to get the duck after worldwide phone calls spread the rumor and Rutledge gets a phone call from President Richard Nixon to ""get that duck!"". Albert is overcome by greed and no longer cares for his son, which saddens Jimmy. The Treasury Department officials  soon arrives at the house and orders them to turn over the duck. Jimmy, watching from upstairs, climbs out the window with Charlie, and then rides off with a couple of teenage boys and their hot rod as the government officials try to capture the duck to prevent it from laying gold. In the film's climax, Jimmy is suspended on a ladder between two parking garages, and Albert attempts to convince his son to grab his hand before the ladder falls. Jimmy tells his dad to ""go away"", believing he only wants to save Charlie, but when the ladder begins to break, he grows fearful and grabs his father's hand. They then leave the parking garage, but Albert is promptly arrested by the US Treasury Department officials. The film ends with the family in court, and the judge breaks an egg into a glass after Mr. Hooper  and then Albert  barks at the duck to prompt the laying of the egg, which surprisingly turns out to be an ordinary egg yolk, as the effect of the radiation had run out. The judge dismisses the charges on account of no proof of a duck laying golden eggs, and Albert tells the family the golden duck was nice while it lasted, but at least they can keep the duck for their pet, now realizing that his family is more important than wealth. The judge then advises Jimmy, ""One word of caution, son. If it ever lays another gold egg, bury it, quick!"" Albert then puts Jimmy on his shoulders and exits the courthouse into a crowd of cheering onlookers."

The plot begins with the wet-behind-the-ears new recruit Piggy , who is plunged at the deep end in her first surveillance assignment working alongside her mentor, Sergeant Wong . Both of them work for the Hong Kong Police Force's Criminal Intelligence Bureau. After reviewing the jewelry store surveillance videos recordings, the Force attempt to track down one of the robbers by staking out the neighborhood they think he lives in. Fatman  is identified and tracked without his knowledge through a combination of tails, surveillance footage, and data-mining, including accessing his octopus card. The Force ambush is established at the scene of the next robbery, but the elusive Hollow Man  notices the police. As the robbers flee, some are killed by a Police Tactical Unit, but the rest escape. Chan kills an uniformed police officer as he flees, and Piggy stops to give first aid rather than continue the pursuit. The surveillance unit is then called to another case; a kidnapping. Piggy is staking out a phone booth where the kidnapper may make a call, when she sees Hollow Man go by. She recognises the kidnapper from Fatman's apartment building and allows the police to rescue the kidnap victim, while she pursues Hollow Man. After a tense confrontation in a cafe, where Hollow Man confronts her, she escapes suspicion, but Hollow Man notices Sergent Wong and stabs him in the neck with a pair of scissors. Wong convinces Piggy to continue to follow Hollow Man as he slowly bleeds to death. Piggy follows Wong to his hideout and calls for the Police Tactical Unit again. Meanwhile, Wong survives his injury and gets medical attention. In the raid on the hideout, Hollow Man flees down a dock and wounds himself mortally in the neck running past a hanging hook, and the other robbers were captured.

A mysterious old man, Mr. Frederick Percival Blunden  visits the family, introducing himself as a representative of a firm of solicitors. The family are told there is an opportunity to become the caretakers of a derelict country mansion in the Home Counties called Langley Park, which had been gutted by fire years before, and is now in the charge of the solicitors. Mrs. Allen's brief is to stay there until the heirs of the original owners can be traced. Out of desperation, Mrs. Allen agrees to take up the post. There are rumors that the house is haunted, and as a result few locals venture up to the property. One day while wandering the grounds, Lucy and Jamie see the ghosts coming towards them: a teenage girl, Sara Latimer , and her younger brother, Georgie , the two children who lived in the house a century earlier. Sara tells them that she and her brother are orphans, under the care of their drunken and incompetent Uncle Bertie  and the solicitor Mr. Blunden until Georgie comes of age. They suspect that the housekeeper Mrs. Wickens  and her disturbed and often violent husband are plotting to kill them in order to get her hands on Georgie's inheritance. They live at the house because Arabella, Mrs Wickens's attractive but dim-witted daughter, is Uncle Bertie's wife. Sara and Georgie have found a book with instructions for travelling through time, so that they can get help. Lucy and Jamie agree to travel back with them, and they arrange to meet Sara the next day. Jamie searches the graveyard, in the hope of finding nothing and being able to go back to help, knowing in advance that they will succeed.

When Ho Nam and his friends are beaten by Hung Hing's ""Ugly Kwan""  and his men following a misunderstanding, they decide to join the society, following Bee. 10-years later in 1995, Ho Nam and his buddies have established themselves as Bee's enforcers, performing their first successful hit on Kwan's right-hand ""Ba Bai"" . At the same time, Brother Fai Hung has the stuttering Smartie  carjack Ho Nam's Toyota MR2 and demands payment, but unfortunately she gets caught by Ho Nam and his friends and is punished by eating dozens of Chinese barbecue pork buns. Seeing Ho Nam is making a name for himself in the society, Kwan attempts to buy him out and have Ho Nam work for him instead of Bee, but the gangster refuses. When he finds Smartie about to be forced into an adult film produced by Kwan's studio, Ho Nam takes her aside, claiming she is his woman. The indebted Smartie follows him, even beginning to fall for him. One day, Bee is tasked with an assignment by Hung Hing Chairman Chiang Tin Sung  to head to Macau and perform another hit. Bee orders Ho Nam and his men to execute the plan. Sadly, this was all a ploy on Kwan's doing: by using Chicken's fidelity to separate him from Ho Nam and falsifying information to Chairman Chiang, Ho Nam and his remaining friends are ambushed by other triad members under Kwan. Chow Pee is brutally killed and Ho Nam is blamed for the failed hit. Friendships begin to tear apart when Chicken's girlfriend and Ho Nam are kidnapped and drugged by Kwan's men into sex, videotaping their actions as proof of violating orders. With nearly all of Hung Hing looking for them for explanations, Chicken heads to Taiwan in exile. At a Hung Hing summit, Kwan accuses Bee of failing the hit and Ho Nam for breaking the ""code"" of sleeping with his best friend's woman, with the videotape as evidence. Kwan also takes the opportunity of blaming Chairman Chiang for not inducing better protocols within the society and nominates himself as the new chairman. Other branch leaders are in agreement, thus Chiang steps down and Kwan takes the head position, with only Bee opposing him. To settle things, Ho Nam is punished and banned from rejoining Hung Hing. Ten months later, Kwan orders Bee killed alongside his entire family. With most of Hung Hing siding with Kwan, and no evidence to support Kwan killing Bee, Ho Nam can do next to nothing, until Chicken returns from Taiwan, now a branch leader in a local triad and re-establishes relations with his friends. Deciding to get rid of Kwan and bring back the morally inclined Chiang, Ho Nam and Chicken bribe other branch leaders into assassinating Kwan. Working indirectly with local law enforcement, who have discovered Kwan has been smuggling cocaine using his film studio, Ho Nam and his allies manage to corner Kwan, who admits to everything, until he is shot and killed by a police officer for mistakenly wielding a firearm. Chiang returns and retakes the position of Hung Hing chairman, congratulating Ho Nam for his efforts, ensuring his name will be well known throughout the society. This movie glorifies the value in being virtuous even in a life of crime. In a world in which loyalties do not exist, these group of young gangsters stood by their friends and followed the code of friendship even to the end. Against all odds it seems, that good eventually triumphed over evil at the snapshot to potraits as the screen fades to background in grey the screen fades to black and the movie ends it was officially reinnaugurated by Young and Dangerous 2 it was officially premiered on 30 March 1996."

Two of the colts are of very good stock, especially the beautiful and spirited colt from the famous racehorse ""Regret"" (John Conroy says that the colt is worth a thousand pounds  and that he wants the colt to eventually be the [[stud . Jim Ryan arrives at John Conroy's property following the death of his father. When he and Conroy's daughter, Kate, see each other, it is love at first sight for them both. Jim, however, finds resentment at his presence at the station, both from John Conroy, the owner of the property, and the station's stockmen and station hands, with Dan Mulligan , disdainfully commenting ""We don't want any swagmen here"". Saltbush and McGinness McGee also make disparaging remarks about Jim Ryan's horse, with Saltbush sarcastically asking Jim if he bought his horse from a Mark Foys catalogue, and McGinness McGee commenting that it was more likely that the horse had been saved from a glue factory. John Conroy also comments that they have enough men working on the property already. Kate pleads with her father to give Jim a job at the property, and he finally relents, saying that Jim can help break the horses. John Conroy resents it when Jim Ryan says that he knows of a better way to break horses than the horse-breaking method being used at the property. However, John Conroy says that Jim could prove his expertise in horse breaking by breaking the colt from ""Regret"". During the night, the Brumby herd gallops close to the homestead, and the colt from ""Regret"" breaks free from his tethers and joins them. John Conroy is furious at the loss of his prized colt, and unfairly blames Jim for what has occurred. Conroy decides to get all the crack riders  from the stations near and far to come to the property and hunt for the Brumbies, offering a reward of £1000, and angrily orders Jim to leave the property first thing in the morning. The crack riders gather at the homestead the following morning, including ""Harrison"" who won his fortune when ""Pardon"" won the cup, , and ""Clancy of the Overflow"" . Jim shyly turns up to join in the ride to hunt for the colt and Brumbies, but finds that, apart from his friend, Clancy, he is not wanted by anyone on the ride. Clancy convinces the others that, as both Jim and his horse were mountain-reared, they would be of great help in the ride. The Brumbies are too quick for the riders and, when it becomes too steep and dangerous with Wombat holes , all riders stop short of the dangerous descent — apart from Jim, who continues to chase the Brumby herd - finally bringing the herd  back to John Conroy's property. John Conroy is delighted to have his colt back again, and gives his approval to Jim marrying Kate. A concert and country dance are then held in celebration and recognition of Jim's deed, as well as a superb equestrian pageant, and all ends happily."

One day a fortune teller tells him that a blue-eyed princess from overseas will enter his life and change it forever. She is the dream girl that he has been searching for. On the way from Austria to an intended holiday in Singapore, Sonia  and her nanny stop off in Mumbai. When their connecting flight is delayed Sonia decides instead to travel to Malaga , the birthplace of her mother, who died when Sonia was very young. Sonia has been brought up by her father  since her mother mysteriously abandoned the family to return to Malaga. Although Sonia knows her father will be very angry with her - he hates India and Indians due to his wife leaving him - Sonia wants to see her mother’s grave for the first time. She convinces her father to let her stay in Malaga for a few days in order to fulfil her wish. Upon arrival in Malaga, Sonia meets Tony and hires him to show her the area and to help her find her mother’s grave. As Sonia and Tony see the sights of Goa and find her mother’s grave, Tony begins to fall in love with Sonia and it appears Sonia is very fond of him. Unbeknownst to Tony, his childhood friend Neena  is in love with him and she does not take kindly to him spending all his time with Sonia. One day when Sonia is travelling with Tony, she sees a man in the distance. Flashbacks show that the man is Prem Arya , an Indian journalist who Sonia met in Austria when he was interviewing her father. Prem and Sonia became friends, fell in love and hoped to marry. When Sonia’s father found out, he forbade them to marry because Prem is Indian, and although they are deeply in love, they agree to separate. Returning to the present, Sonia is shocked to find Prem is in Malaga. When she sees that Prem has written an article about Tony and that they are good friends, she asks Tony to organise a lunch on the pretence of meeting the author of the article. Prem agrees to the meeting and is startled to see Sonia. When Tony goes to order lunch, Sonia reveals to Prem that she is still in love with him and is sorry about having to leave him in order to keep her father happy. Prem tells her that there is no point in having these feelings as there is nothing either of them can do about it and, overcome by emotion, he leaves. When Tony returns from ordering lunch, Sonia says she wants to leave too, resulting in a very confused Tony. The next day Sonia calls Prem and admits he still loves her and has not been able to stop thinking about her. They begin to spend time together and after returning from one outing with Prem, Sonia admits to her nanny that she is in madly in love with Prem and that he is a wonderful and kind person. Tony overhears this and believes Sonia is referring to her feelings for him. On another occasion Tony and Neena join Prem and Sonia on their outing. It is obvious to both Prem and Sonia that Neena loves Tony and so Sonia attempts to tell Tony that Neena loves him. Tony mistakes her comments and, in combination with what he has already overhead, believes that Sonia is trying to tell him that she loves him. As Sonia and Prem spend time together, Sonia realises that her true happiness lies in being with Prem. Unfortunately Sonia’s father travels to Malaga to surprise her and discovers that Sonia has been seeing Prem again. He believes that she intentionally travelled to Malaga to see Prem and does not believe that it was a coincidence. He forbids Prem to see Sonia and orders Sonia to pack, intending to take her back to Austria straight away. Sonia advises Tony that she will be returning to Austria and he is devastated. Sonia invites Tony to join her in Austria and Tony willingly accepts. Neena is extremely upset but Tony thinks this is because he is leaving her alone in Malaga – he assures her that he will find a job for her once he is settled in Austria and continues happily packing in preparation for his journey. Sonia makes one last trip to the cemetery and is met by a priest who tells her the true reason of her mother’s return to Malaga. When she gets to the airport she is met by Tony who tells her that he cannot go with her to Austria anymore, he has discovered a message left for him by Neena, revealing her feelings and wishing him happiness in his new life. He tells Sonia that he knows she loves him and although he loves her in return, he realises that Neena relaise on him and will not cope if he leaves. Achieving his dream of being with Sonia will be at the expense of Neena and he is not prepared to do this. Sonia tries to tell Tony that she does not love him but he leaves quickly, not wanting a sad farewell. Sonia’s father makes derogatory comments Indians and about Tony not joining them, but Sonia defends Tony and tells her father of his sacrifice. After seeing this sacrifice, Sonia realises that she cannot give up Prem just to keep her father happy and begs him to let them marry. Her father still refuses and makes further derogatory comments about Indians and her mother and this is when Sonia reveals the truth – that her mother was diagnosed with a contagious disease and so made the sacrifice to leave the two of them and die alone in India, so that they would not get sick. She gives her father letters written by her mother  and he apologises to Sonia and tells her to go to Prem. Tony and Neena are happily sitting in a restaurant when Tony notices Sonia at another table with Prem. Tony believes Sonia has not left Malaga because she wants to be near to him . Tony comments that although she looks quite pale and sad, Sonia will eventually get over her feelings for him. At Sonia and Prem’s table, Sonia suggests to Prem that they should thank Tony because it was he who brought them together, and she also wants to clarify with Tony that she never had feelings for him. Prem stops her and advises that some dreams are so beautiful that they should not be destroyed - that it is better for Tony to believe that he gave up a princess for an ordinary girl.

One day when Sonia is travelling with Tony, she sees a man in the distance. Flashbacks show that the man is Prem Arya , an Indian journalist who Sonia met in Austria when he was interviewing her father. Prem and Sonia became friends, fell in love and hoped to marry. When Sonia’s father found out, he forbade them to marry because Prem is Indian, and although they are deeply in love, they agree to separate. Returning to the present, Sonia is shocked to find Prem is in Malaga. When she sees that Prem has written an article about Tony and that they are good friends, she asks Tony to organise a lunch on the pretence of meeting the author of the article. Prem agrees to the meeting and is startled to see Sonia. When Tony goes to order lunch, Sonia reveals to Prem that she is still in love with him and is sorry about having to leave him in order to keep her father happy. Prem tells her that there is no point in having these feelings as there is nothing either of them can do about it and, overcome by emotion, he leaves. When Tony returns from ordering lunch, Sonia says she wants to leave too, resulting in a very confused Tony. The next day Sonia calls Prem and admits he still loves her and has not been able to stop thinking about her. They begin to spend time together and after returning from one outing with Prem, Sonia admits to her nanny that she is in madly in love with Prem and that he is a wonderful and kind person. Tony overhears this and believes Sonia is referring to her feelings for him. On another occasion Tony and Neena join Prem and Sonia on their outing. It is obvious to both Prem and Sonia that Neena loves Tony and so Sonia attempts to tell Tony that Neena loves him. Tony mistakes her comments and, in combination with what he has already overhead, believes that Sonia is trying to tell him that she loves him. As Sonia and Prem spend time together, Sonia realises that her true happiness lies in being with Prem. Unfortunately Sonia’s father travels to Malaga to surprise her and discovers that Sonia has been seeing Prem again. He believes that she intentionally travelled to Malaga to see Prem and does not believe that it was a coincidence. He forbids Prem to see Sonia and orders Sonia to pack, intending to take her back to Austria straight away. Sonia advises Tony that she will be returning to Austria and he is devastated. Sonia invites Tony to join her in Austria and Tony willingly accepts. Neena is extremely upset but Tony thinks this is because he is leaving her alone in Malaga – he assures her that he will find a job for her once he is settled in Austria and continues happily packing in preparation for his journey. Sonia makes one last trip to the cemetery and is met by a priest who tells her the true reason of her mother’s return to Malaga. When she gets to the airport she is met by Tony who tells her that he cannot go with her to Austria anymore, he has discovered a message left for him by Neena, revealing her feelings and wishing him happiness in his new life. He tells Sonia that he knows she loves him and although he loves her in return, he realises that Neena relaise on him and will not cope if he leaves. Achieving his dream of being with Sonia will be at the expense of Neena and he is not prepared to do this. Sonia tries to tell Tony that she does not love him but he leaves quickly, not wanting a sad farewell. Sonia’s father makes derogatory comments Indians and about Tony not joining them, but Sonia defends Tony and tells her father of his sacrifice. After seeing this sacrifice, Sonia realises that she cannot give up Prem just to keep her father happy and begs him to let them marry. Her father still refuses and makes further derogatory comments about Indians and her mother and this is when Sonia reveals the truth – that her mother was diagnosed with a contagious disease and so made the sacrifice to leave the two of them and die alone in India, so that they would not get sick. She gives her father letters written by her mother  and he apologises to Sonia and tells her to go to Prem. Tony and Neena are happily sitting in a restaurant when Tony notices Sonia at another table with Prem. Tony believes Sonia has not left Malaga because she wants to be near to him . Tony comments that although she looks quite pale and sad, Sonia will eventually get over her feelings for him. At Sonia and Prem’s table, Sonia suggests to Prem that they should thank Tony because it was he who brought them together, and she also wants to clarify with Tony that she never had feelings for him. Prem stops her and advises that some dreams are so beautiful that they should not be destroyed - that it is better for Tony to believe that he gave up a princess for an ordinary girl.

At the center of this is Gigi , a young woman who repeatedly misinterprets the behavior of her romantic partners.  Gigi is a single woman who repeatedly misreads mundane actions and comments from her dates as indications they are romantically interested in her. She then frets when the guy doesn't call. In attempting to meet Conor at a bar, she befriends the bar owner Alex  who reveals the strategies men use to avoid a woman. He explains that if a man is interested in a woman, he will overcome any obstacles to ensure they date again, and that Gigi has been misinterpreting and obsessing over imagined ""signs"" she receives from men. This friendship continues and Gigi interprets his eagerness to always assist, such as taking Gigi's call while he is on a date, as a sign that he is interested in her. She eventually makes a move but Alex claims he is not interested in her romantically. Gigi has moved on from Alex, no longer desperately trying to construct evidence the man is interested in her. However, in a role reversal, Alex began mooning over Gigi. After leaving several unanswered messages Alex arrives at Gigi's apartment to declare his love. They kiss and start dating.  Gigi's friend and co-worker Janine  is having difficulties in her marriage to Ben . As Janine obsesses on their home renovations, Ben becomes attracted to Anna , a yoga instructor and aspiring singer, and the feeling is mutual. Ben and Anna pursue a flirtatious friendship under the pretense of him helping her establish a singing career. Ben reveals to Anna that Janine coerced him into marriage by threatening to leave if he didn't propose. Fervently anti-smoking , Janine pointedly asks Ben if he has been smoking, and later is perturbed to find cigarette butts hidden in the back yard of the house. Ben insists they are not his. Their contractor Javier, aggressively interrogated by Janine, says none of his workers smoke at the house. During a tense shopping trip to select flooring, Ben reveals to Janine that he has cheated on her. Janine is devastated but rationalizes Ben's behavior, blaming herself for being too cold in the relationship, and declares she wants to save their marriage. After a positive meeting about her singing career, Anna begins to have sex with Ben in his office. They are interrupted by Janine who, hoping to spice up their marriage, has arrived unexpectedly. Anna hides in a closet and Ben attempts to send Janine away. But she makes a heartfelt plea to save their marriage, and there are indications she succeeds in seducing him. After Janine leaves Anna angrily departs vowing to cut ties with Ben. As Janine tidies up Ben's clothes back at their newly completed house, fully satisfied to make it a home, she discovers a fresh pack of cigarettes in a pocket. She explodes in anger. When Ben arrives home he finds his clothes neatly folded with a whole carton of cigarettes and a note attached from Janine asking for a divorce. Janine moves into a new apartment by herself to start a new life. Anna is later seen performing at an upscale nightclub. Ben is alone, purchasing the same beer at the same supermarket where he met Anna.  Ben's lover Anna enjoys a close friendship with Alex's friend, real estate agent, Conor ([[Kevin Connolly . He is romantically interested in her, while Anna is only interested in a casual relationship with Conor. Conor misinterprets her hugs and cute nicknames for potential romantic interest. Anna's friend, Mary  is in ad sales for a local newspaper. She helps Conor promote his real estate business in a series of print ads. Like Gigi, she meets many men , but despite constantly monitoring emails, pager, phone, and Myspace messages, the ""meetings"" go nowhere. ; While Conor attempts to cultivate a gay clientele, two gay men tell him how he is going wrong with Anna. Taking their advice, Conor decides to declare his love to Anna. Vulnerable after falling out with Ben, Anna agrees to start a serious relationship with him. When Conor proposes buying a house and moving in together, Anna admits she doesn't want to, and they break up. Mary later runs into Conor, recognizing him from his ad photo, and introduces herself, since they have only spoken over the phone. They hit it off, and start dating.  Gigi's other co-worker, Beth , is living with her boyfriend, Neil , who is also friends with Ben. After seven years together, Beth wants to get married, but Neil does not believe in marriage. With Gigi's newfound pragmatic stance on relationships after advice from Alex, she announces that she will no longer misinterpret vague gestures from men as more than they really are. This spurs Beth to confront Neil about their relationship. When he still does not want to get married, she breaks up with him. Later, the fraught preparations for her younger sister Paige's  wedding bring the issue into sharper focus to Beth. During the reception, her father  suffers a heart attack. Beth looks after him as he recuperates while her sisters sit moping and their husbands remain glued to the television. As the household falls into chaos, Neil arrives with groceries and has tidied the kitchen. The two reconcile, with Beth saying that Neil is more of a husband to her than her sisters' spouses are to them, and she will not insist they be married. Neil later proposes to her, and they marry in an intimate ceremony aboard his sailboat."

Brett Camber  is a young boy and a son of a mechanic, Joe,  whose only companion is a St. Bernard named ""Cujo."" Cujo is bitten by a bat with rabies and his behavior begins to change. While the dog begins to succumb to the disease, Brett and his mother leave for Connecticut to visit his mother's sister. When Donna and her young son, Tad , drive out to the home where Cujo and the Cambers live, the gentle Cujo, now crazed by the disease, has killed Joe and the Cambers' neighbor Gary Pervier. Making matters worse, their Ford Pinto car's alternator dies at the Cambers' house. Donna and Tad are trapped inside the Pinto while the massive dog waits outside, attacking repeatedly, all while Vic is out of town on a business trip. The hot sun makes the conditions nearly unbearable, but Donna knows that certain death awaits them outside. Donna decides that she must do something before they both die from either heatstroke or dehydration, but the dog could be anywhere, however, and attempts at escape are foiled by repeated attacks by the mad dog, who tries to get into the car. The local Sheriff comes to the house, and, after a brief standoff, is himself killed by the massive dog. Donna decides that she must risk going outside to save Tad, but the dog jumps out from underneath the car and bites her in the leg, forcing her back into the car. Eventually, a badly wounded Donna makes an attempt to dash for the house but is attacked by Cujo, the only safety being the car. After a brutal struggle between the desperate mother and the relentless animal, Donna takes advantage of a momentary distraction and beats Cujo with a baseball bat several times until the bat breaks off, leaving only a jagged handle. The dog jumps at her, only to land on the broken handle, impaling him. Donna pushes the dog off and uses the sheriff's revolver to break open the windshield and retrieve Tad, as Cujo had broken all of the handles. Donna revives her son, who had passed out due to the extreme heat and dehydration. Cujo tears through the kitchen window and uses the last of his strength to try and kill the two. Before he can attack, Donna pulls out the Sheriff's pistol and shoots and kills Cujo. She joins her husband outside who has just arrived as the carnage ends and the credits roll."

Two ""Movers"", Nick and his father, are running from the ""Division"". Nick's father tells him of a vision he received from a ""Watcher""; a girl will give him a flower and he must help her in order to help all the people with powers. Nick's father hides him as Agent Carver of the Division arrives. Nick's father is killed. Ten years later, the American Division tests a power boosting drug on a ""Pusher""  named Kira. Rendering the doctor unconscious, Kira steals his security clearance card and an augmentation drug-filled syringe before escaping. In Hong Kong, Nick is hiding as an expatriate. A young girl, Cassie, arrives at Nick's apartment, explaining that she is a Watcher and that they are going to find a case containing six million dollars. Following Cassie's predictions, they go to a nightclub. Nick sees an old friend, Hook, who is a ""Shifter"". He tells them to go to Emily, a ""Sniff"" who can help them find Kira. Nick and Cassie find Kira, who had a romantic relationship with Nick. They recruit a ""Shadow"" named Pinky to hide Kira from the Sniffs. Cassie finds a key in her shoe to a locker in which Kira hid a case. With the aid of Cassie's visions, they piece together the events that led them to meet; Cassie's mother used her visions to set a complex plan in motion that will destroy the Division. Nick devises a plan that involves seven envelopes in which he places instructions; each person in the group is entrusted with one envelope. Nick uses a ""Wiper"" to erase his memories of the plan. Hook retrieves the case, which has the syringe Kira stole, and brings it to Cassie. Hook shifts another case to match the case with the syringe. Cassie takes the shifted case to Nick's apartment and waits. Nick regains consciousness: he has no memory of the envelopes or his plan. He opens his envelope, which tells him to return home. He finds the case in his room but Carver introduces himself to Kira as a friend, stating that her memories are false; she is a Division agent who volunteered to take the augmentation injection and suffered amnesia. Carver shows Kira her badge. Before saying goodbye, Nick assures a worried Cassie that she will survive and everything is going to be fine. She leaves as the Hong Kong watcher tracks her to finally kill her. At the last moment, the Wiper appears and erases her memory, saving Cassie. Nick goes to retrieve the augmentation drug and confronts Carver and Kira. Carver tells Kira and Nick that their relationship never happened; it was a ""push"" memory. Kira reveals she has been using Nick and Nick takes the three to the building that contains the lockers and the case. Carver locks Nick in his car's trunk and goes to retrieve the case. They are ambushed by the Triads. In the midst of the fight, Nick is released. He goes to find Kira and is confronted by Victor, another Mover and a Division agent who works for Carver. During the fight between Nick and Victor, two of the Bleeders kill Victor. Nick grabs the case and jams the syringe into his arm, apparently killing himself. After the fight ends and Carver leaves with Kira, Nick wakes up. Cassie appears, and retrieves the true case, revealing that Nick injected himself with soy sauce, as they planned. Asked whether they will see Kira again, Cassie tells Nick that they will see ""Miss Trouble soon enough"". Flying back to America with a sleeping Carver, Kira opens her purse and finds her envelope. She remembers Nick telling her to open it when ""she started doubting the truth"" and opens it. She finds a photograph of herself and Nick in a relationship, and a message written on the photograph that says ""KILL HIM"" on the upper left corner and ""See U soon, Nick"" on the lower right. Kira ""pushes"" Carver, commanding him to put his gun in his mouth and pull the trigger. The screen fades to black, followed by the sound of a gunshot."

A university librarian, poet, and complicated man, he has left behind a trail of unresolved issues, a dysfunctional family, and a disturbing mystery. Red Roses and Petrol, a darkly comic feature film by director Tamar Simon Hoffs, explores the emotional twists and turns of familial relationships. Enda’s dazed widow, Moya , anxiously prepares for the next day’s funeral with her still stuck-at-home, twenty-something daughter Medbh  , lending a loving hand. Moya’s desperation to keep her family together and Medbh’s sharp tongue provide the backdrop for the arrival from New York of headstrong older sister Catherine , with her handsome but awkward boyfriend Tom ([[Greg Ellis  in tow. They doubt that London-based Johnny , the angry black sheep brother of the family, will appear at all. Sorting through boxes of Enda’s books, the women discover a cache of self-recorded video diaries that might shed light on who Enda Doyle really was, and some of the secrets of his life that he was never able to share with them. At the funeral, the daughters see a distraught young woman from the university, Helen , rumored to be having an affair with Enda. They’re stunned that she would show up so brazenly at a family gathering for the deceased Enda. Returning home, they find Johnny emerging half-naked from the shower, after a quick tryst with a stewardess he met on his flight from London. A brilliant, wounded slacker, Johnny manages to irritate everyone to the edge of violence with his biting and sarcastic recall of the family’s long buried memories. Johnny’s confrontational behavior and bitter assessment of life with father, incite the clan into what can only be called unchecked family therapy. Throughout the ensuing arguments, which reach a fevered pitch as the family gets inebriated waiting for guests to arrive for the wake, we learn about the powerful and ambiguous force that was Enda Doyle. Finally, Catherine cannot contain herself and accuses Moya of being blind to her husband’s infidelity and by extension causing great harm to herself and her children. In a surprising twist, Enda’s own videotapes give the family the answers they returned home to find.

But Dr. Spencer suspects that there is something wrong, and theorizes that Monica is deliberately and abusively making her son sick all the time so that she could have him admitted to the hospital for all of the attention that it gives her. However, hospital administrators are skeptical, and when Eric's young roommate also develops a similar illness, it only serves to make them even more dismissive. Adding to Dr. Spencer's stress is her troubled relationship with rebellious teenage daughter, Amanda, who is still grieving over the loss of her father and trying to fit in at a new school. To top it off, the two are later victims of a robbery by the woman Dr. Spencer hired as a housekeeper, whose take included some irreplaceable jewelry Amanda had received as gifts from her late father. When Dr. Spencer decides to ban Monica from being around her ill son and get child services to help him, Monica gets back by trying to get her and the hospital sued. Some of the other employees at the hospital board disagree with Dr. Spencer's diagnosis of Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy by thinking she is overreacting. Even when Monica is kept away from Eric, he is getting worse and no better. With what seems like the whole hospital against her, Dr. Spencer takes on the help of a lawyer and the case goes to court. The court case determines whether social services will take care of the son or whether Monica can keep the child. However, Dr. Spencer believes that losing the court case will mean Eric's death. At first, things seem to be going in Monica's favor. However, an unexpected break occurs when a young patient tells Amanda  that she saw Monica in Eric's room the night before, thus violating the restraining order against her. The next day in court, the prosecution drops a bombshell with the revelation that between 1989 and 1994, while he and his mother lived in Seattle, Eric had been admitted to various hospitals with unexplained abdominal cramps a total of twenty-six times, which was eventually diagnosed as laxative abuse. Furthermore, it is revealed that back in 1982, Monica had a child out of wedlock, who also died of laxative abuse when he was only 18 months old. The revelation of this fact prompts Monica to have a breakdown on the witness stand and results in her losing custody of Eric, who is placed in the care of his grandmother. Despite her misgivings, satisfied that she had saved Eric's life, Dr. Spencer now realizes she also needs to improve her relationship with Amanda, telling her she loves her and promising to change.

At first, things seem to be going in Monica's favor. However, an unexpected break occurs when a young patient tells Amanda  that she saw Monica in Eric's room the night before, thus violating the restraining order against her. The next day in court, the prosecution drops a bombshell with the revelation that between 1989 and 1994, while he and his mother lived in Seattle, Eric had been admitted to various hospitals with unexplained abdominal cramps a total of twenty-six times, which was eventually diagnosed as laxative abuse. Furthermore, it is revealed that back in 1982, Monica had a child out of wedlock, who also died of laxative abuse when he was only 18 months old. The revelation of this fact prompts Monica to have a breakdown on the witness stand and results in her losing custody of Eric, who is placed in the care of his grandmother. Despite her misgivings, satisfied that she had saved Eric's life, Dr. Spencer now realizes she also needs to improve her relationship with Amanda, telling her she loves her and promising to change.

The film begins when a girl is murdered by an unseen killer. It is learnt that the killer was her fiancee & had acquired evidence about her infidelity. Then, the story shifts to life of Sehar , a voiceover artist. Sehar, who lives alone in a flat, has a friend named Ritu , who is a fashion designer. Sehar has a rare disorder - her memory blanks out, leaving her clueless about events that took place in a certain time period. Hence, she rarely socializes. But Ritu forcefully takes her to a nightclub. Sehar had previously met ACP Rajveer Randhawa , a corrupt cop. Unknown to both, their mothers are old friends and want them to get married. Sehar has rejected Rajveer after knowing his truth, but he is smitten. Here, Sehar wakes up in her flat and apparently nothing wrong has happened. But she soon learns that she has missed one whole day. Also, she is being followed by a stranger . She runs into two characters, Ballu , a taxi driver asking her a trip fare about which she knows nothing & Kumar , a wannabe actor, who mistakes her for a ghost. But the plot thickens when Sehar hears some suspicious messages on her answering machine, making her realize that something sinister has happened during the missing Sunday, the day she recalls nothing about. Rajveer comes to rescue, but he comes to the same conclusion as hers. Tests show that Sehar was roofied - most probably in the night club, causing the whole problem. Ballu & Kumar turn out to be red herrings. Rajveer finds the boys who roofied Sehar, but nothing concrete is found. Just as he is about to accept that Sehar might have killed someone, Sehar is attacked by some goons. The goons fail to kill her, but Rajveer realizes that Sehar might have witnessed a murder. After reconstructing the events at the night out with Ritu, Rajveer finds out that Ballu had left her near a place where a youth was murdered. Rajveer realizes the implications and sets a trap for the goons. With help of Ballu & Kumar, the goons are finally nabbed & Rajveer learns the truth. He arrests the son of Khurana, a minister, for a double murder. An enraged Khurana demands an explanation. It is revealed that the girl murdered earlier was killed by Khurana's son. After killing her, he waited for few days before killing his own friend, with whom the girl was cheating him. Unfortunately, Sehar was left nearby by Ballu. Khurana's son assumed that she saw the second murder, hence he sent the goons to kill her. Khurana's son protests until brought face to face with the goons. Khurana has his son arrested. With Sehar safe, the people are still clueless about Sehar's stalker - until the stalker shows up himself. He reveals himself to be a taxi driver. It is revealed that after Khurana's son had seen Sehar, it was this taxi driver who saw Sehar. He realized that she was drugged and managed to get her back to her flat after finding her address. With this final mystery solved, Kumar narrates what happened with everybody, Rajveer and Sehar got married, Ballu now owns a car company, owning hundreds of cars and trucks, and Kumar has become a south-Indian superstar, showing that the story ended on a happy note.

Crewson and his cohorts, however, are physically and mentally exhausted from the war and simply want to enjoy a few days away from it. Suffering from combat stress and confronted with a number of reminders of the horrors of war, Crewson tries to amuse himself by making a play for Turnbill's attractive fiancée, Gwinneth Livingston . She resists his advances at first, but ultimately throws her engagement ring in Turnbill's face.

A letter written by Barnesworth claims that the hotel brings in more than $14,000 per month. Baxter, clearly chafing under the dehumanizing conditions at the office, views this as a golden opportunity. Baxter quits his job in a grand spectacle and moves his family to Colorado to take proprietorship of the hotel. The family finds it to be an immense but ramshackle building with no heat and a colorful old codger, Jesse McCord , living in the shed. Initially, Baxter is inclined to turn McCord out for what appeared to be breaking and entering until he is pressured by his family—mainly his children—to allow McCord to stay. McCord offers his services as a bartender, but Baxter assigns him the job of bellhop, which McCord takes with a characteristically easygoing nature. Some time later, Baxter and his wife are walking on the hills behind the hotel, trying to decide what to do about the hotel. With no real attractions nearby, they are unsure what, if anything, they could do with the property until a chance meeting with Wally, a local boy employed by the gas station, out for a ride on his snowmobile. He apologizes for making tracks in Baxter's snow and is about to leave when Baxter stops him to ask what he meant. Wally explains that the Grand Imperial sits on a huge amount of property, ""about as far as you can see,"" as he puts it. Baxter realizes that the hilly terrain is exactly the attraction the hotel needs; they can turn the hill adjacent to the hotel into a ski lodge. Baxter attempts to secure funding for his plans. Local banker Martin Ridgeway  expresses great interest in Baxter's daring idea, but also offers to buy the lodge in order to convert it into a boys' school in honor of the deceased uncle. Baxter declines. Ridgeway, in turn, declines to give Baxter a loan, citing him as a bad collateral risk and specifically pointing out that Baxter has no experience in hotel or restaurant management, likely making his business venture a failure. All during this exchange, Ridgeway's secretary appears quite agitated, but does not speak up. Baxter leaves the bank without a loan, but determined to find one. Baxter searches for funding elsewhere and finds a friendly banker in the next town named Mr. Wainwright ([[George Kirkpatrick  who is interested in Baxter's venture. Wainwright agrees to meet with Baxter at a ski lodge — Baxter, not willing to make the same mistake as he did with Ridgeway by admitting he knows nothing about hotels or skiing, claims to be an avid skier. Wainwright, taking Baxter at his word, takes him to a black diamond run called ""Nightmare Alley."" Faking an injury, Baxter convinces Wainwright to start without him. However, after knocking down a ski rack, Baxter is shoved by an irate skier, sending him down the run anyway. After quite a few close calls, not to mention downing more than a few other skiers, Baxter ends up crashing into a tree. The sensational story is picked up by the local press, which gives the chaos and injuries caused by Baxter's run a fair amount of coverage. While he is recovering, Martin Ridgeway gives Baxter a check for $3,000, taking feigned pity on him. Baxter starts making a list of repairs for the lodge. Meanwhile, local bumpkin Wally Perkins  works with Jesse to repair the hot water heater. The water heater explodes, tearing a hole in the kitchen wall. Ridgeway's check covers the repair, but leaves nothing for the ski lift Baxter had in mind. Jesse comes to the rescue by pulling an old donkey engine out of mothballs, tying a rope around it, and using it as a makeshift ski lift. The restored hotel opens to little fanfare, receiving few customers for several days. When Wally dynamites a tree stump from the ground, the explosion sets off an avalanche, blocking a passing train carrying several hundred skiers. The Baxters quickly shuttle the skiers to their resort. All goes well until Wally commences ski training classes. Having never taught skiing before, Wally loses his balance and skis down a steep mountain, dangling over a ledge while clinging to a pine tree. Using the donkey engine and a rope to lower John Baxter down the mountain to rescue Wally, Jesse accidentally jostles a loose piece of lit firewood onto one of the ropes anchoring the engine in place. Baxter rescues Wally, who suffers a broken arm. The burning rope tears, setting the donkey engine free. It slides down the mountain with Baxter in tow, still roped to the machine after having rescued Wally. The engine plows through the hotel. All of the guests check out, leaving the Baxters out of money once again. John Baxter sheepishly goes back to Ridgeway, asking for an extension on his loan, which Ridgeway flatly refuses. Baxter notices a sign for the Silver Hills Snowmobile Race, with $5,000 prize, a prize that has been won by Ridgeway for the last several runs of the race. Though Baxter has never used a snowmobile, he assumes Wally can drive his slapdash snowmobile. Unfortunately, Wally's broken arm from his skiing accident prevents his involvement. Baxter decides to drive the snowmobile himself, with Jesse as his partner. Baxter's wife, furious that he would risk his own safety and health and certain that the lodge has become an obsession that has eclipsed his duties to his family, threatens to leave. The day of the race, 75-year-old Jesse has second thoughts about partaking in the race aboard Wally's decrepit snowmobile . Baxter reveals that his wife has indeed left with the children, probably for Denver. After a rocky start, Baxter and McCord actually end up passing much of the pack, but a series of unfortunate turns and one unexpected shortcut ends up breaking one of the snowmobile's skis. Heading into town both in the lead and under full power due to a broken throttle, Baxter plows into a snowbank, breaking the other ski. Ridgeway makes the same mistake, and the two end up on the final stretch only seconds apart. Though they come close, Baxter and McCord narrowly miss the finish line. Ridgeway wins first place, and Baxter ends up riding the snowmobile for hours as it will not shut off or stop. As he returns to town well after dark, his snowmobile towed by a horse, he finds his wife waiting for him. The next day, Ridgeway brings the deed transfer papers to the lodge for Baxter to sign. An impassioned plea by Baxter for an extension is again denied, and when Baxter presses the issue, Ridgeway threatens to begin the foreclosure process, but offers to buy the resort from Baxter for practically nothing, again mentioning his Jacob Barnesworth School for Boys plan. Ridgeway's secretary Miss Wigginton  happens to be present during this exchange, and blows her stack in front of Ridgeway, telling everyone the truth: the property includes several hundred acres of pine timberland originally donated to the local Indian tribes by Barnesworth for as long as the tribe inhabited the land. As the tribe has moved away or died out, the land reverts to the estate. Ridgeway wants to buy the resort in order to log the highly valuable timber located on the property. Jesse adds that the land the town was built on was granted by Jacob Farnsworth on the condition that several buildings be erected, including two hospitals  and library. Baxter's son notes that he has not seen a library, and, in genuine confusion, asks why the land has not reverted to Baxter. Wigginton realizes that he is absolutely right, and that Silver Hill is in violation of the grant, meaning that the entire town is built on land now owned by Baxter — including Ridgeway's bank. Ridgeway, now finding himself on the back foot, finds himself being pressed by Baxter for an extension on the loan, which is quickly granted. Baxter pushes his advantage, and Ridgeway quickly agrees to loan Baxter the money necessary to not only repair but greatly expand the resort."

All of the guests check out, leaving the Baxters out of money once again. John Baxter sheepishly goes back to Ridgeway, asking for an extension on his loan, which Ridgeway flatly refuses. Baxter notices a sign for the Silver Hills Snowmobile Race, with $5,000 prize, a prize that has been won by Ridgeway for the last several runs of the race. Though Baxter has never used a snowmobile, he assumes Wally can drive his slapdash snowmobile. Unfortunately, Wally's broken arm from his skiing accident prevents his involvement. Baxter decides to drive the snowmobile himself, with Jesse as his partner. Baxter's wife, furious that he would risk his own safety and health and certain that the lodge has become an obsession that has eclipsed his duties to his family, threatens to leave. The day of the race, 75-year-old Jesse has second thoughts about partaking in the race aboard Wally's decrepit snowmobile . Baxter reveals that his wife has indeed left with the children, probably for Denver. After a rocky start, Baxter and McCord actually end up passing much of the pack, but a series of unfortunate turns and one unexpected shortcut ends up breaking one of the snowmobile's skis. Heading into town both in the lead and under full power due to a broken throttle, Baxter plows into a snowbank, breaking the other ski. Ridgeway makes the same mistake, and the two end up on the final stretch only seconds apart. Though they come close, Baxter and McCord narrowly miss the finish line. Ridgeway wins first place, and Baxter ends up riding the snowmobile for hours as it will not shut off or stop. As he returns to town well after dark, his snowmobile towed by a horse, he finds his wife waiting for him. The next day, Ridgeway brings the deed transfer papers to the lodge for Baxter to sign. An impassioned plea by Baxter for an extension is again denied, and when Baxter presses the issue, Ridgeway threatens to begin the foreclosure process, but offers to buy the resort from Baxter for practically nothing, again mentioning his Jacob Barnesworth School for Boys plan. Ridgeway's secretary Miss Wigginton  happens to be present during this exchange, and blows her stack in front of Ridgeway, telling everyone the truth: the property includes several hundred acres of pine timberland originally donated to the local Indian tribes by Barnesworth for as long as the tribe inhabited the land. As the tribe has moved away or died out, the land reverts to the estate. Ridgeway wants to buy the resort in order to log the highly valuable timber located on the property. Jesse adds that the land the town was built on was granted by Jacob Farnsworth on the condition that several buildings be erected, including two hospitals  and library. Baxter's son notes that he has not seen a library, and, in genuine confusion, asks why the land has not reverted to Baxter. Wigginton realizes that he is absolutely right, and that Silver Hill is in violation of the grant, meaning that the entire town is built on land now owned by Baxter — including Ridgeway's bank. Ridgeway, now finding himself on the back foot, finds himself being pressed by Baxter for an extension on the loan, which is quickly granted. Baxter pushes his advantage, and Ridgeway quickly agrees to loan Baxter the money necessary to not only repair but greatly expand the resort."

A letter written by Barnesworth claims that the hotel brings in more than $14,000 per month. Baxter, clearly chafing under the dehumanizing conditions at the office, views this as a golden opportunity. Baxter quits his job in a grand spectacle and moves his family to Colorado to take proprietorship of the hotel. The family finds it to be an immense but ramshackle building with no heat and a colorful old codger, Jesse McCord , living in the shed. Initially, Baxter is inclined to turn McCord out for what appeared to be breaking and entering until he is pressured by his family—mainly his children—to allow McCord to stay. McCord offers his services as a bartender, but Baxter assigns him the job of bellhop, which McCord takes with a characteristically easygoing nature. Some time later, Baxter and his wife are walking on the hills behind the hotel, trying to decide what to do about the hotel. With no real attractions nearby, they are unsure what, if anything, they could do with the property until a chance meeting with Wally, a local boy employed by the gas station, out for a ride on his snowmobile. He apologizes for making tracks in Baxter's snow and is about to leave when Baxter stops him to ask what he meant. Wally explains that the Grand Imperial sits on a huge amount of property, ""about as far as you can see,"" as he puts it.

Local banker Martin Ridgeway  expresses great interest in Baxter's daring idea, but also offers to buy the lodge in order to convert it into a boys' school in honor of the deceased uncle. Baxter declines. Ridgeway, in turn, declines to give Baxter a loan, citing him as a bad collateral risk and specifically pointing out that Baxter has no experience in hotel or restaurant management, likely making his business venture a failure. All during this exchange, Ridgeway's secretary appears quite agitated, but does not speak up. Baxter leaves the bank without a loan, but determined to find one. Baxter searches for funding elsewhere and finds a friendly banker in the next town named Mr. Wainwright ([[George Kirkpatrick  who is interested in Baxter's venture. Wainwright agrees to meet with Baxter at a ski lodge — Baxter, not willing to make the same mistake as he did with Ridgeway by admitting he knows nothing about hotels or skiing, claims to be an avid skier. Wainwright, taking Baxter at his word, takes him to a black diamond run called ""Nightmare Alley."" Faking an injury, Baxter convinces Wainwright to start without him. However, after knocking down a ski rack, Baxter is shoved by an irate skier, sending him down the run anyway. After quite a few close calls, not to mention downing more than a few other skiers, Baxter ends up crashing into a tree. The sensational story is picked up by the local press, which gives the chaos and injuries caused by Baxter's run a fair amount of coverage. While he is recovering, Martin Ridgeway gives Baxter a check for $3,000, taking feigned pity on him. Baxter starts making a list of repairs for the lodge. Meanwhile, local bumpkin Wally Perkins  works with Jesse to repair the hot water heater. The water heater explodes, tearing a hole in the kitchen wall. Ridgeway's check covers the repair, but leaves nothing for the ski lift Baxter had in mind. Jesse comes to the rescue by pulling an old donkey engine out of mothballs, tying a rope around it, and using it as a makeshift ski lift. The restored hotel opens to little fanfare, receiving few customers for several days. When Wally dynamites a tree stump from the ground, the explosion sets off an avalanche, blocking a passing train carrying several hundred skiers. The Baxters quickly shuttle the skiers to their resort. All goes well until Wally commences ski training classes.

A letter written by Barnesworth claims that the hotel brings in more than $14,000 per month. Baxter, clearly chafing under the dehumanizing conditions at the office, views this as a golden opportunity. Baxter quits his job in a grand spectacle and moves his family to Colorado to take proprietorship of the hotel. The family finds it to be an immense but ramshackle building with no heat and a colorful old codger, Jesse McCord , living in the shed. Initially, Baxter is inclined to turn McCord out for what appeared to be breaking and entering until he is pressured by his family—mainly his children—to allow McCord to stay. McCord offers his services as a bartender, but Baxter assigns him the job of bellhop, which McCord takes with a characteristically easygoing nature. Some time later, Baxter and his wife are walking on the hills behind the hotel, trying to decide what to do about the hotel. With no real attractions nearby, they are unsure what, if anything, they could do with the property until a chance meeting with Wally, a local boy employed by the gas station, out for a ride on his snowmobile. He apologizes for making tracks in Baxter's snow and is about to leave when Baxter stops him to ask what he meant. Wally explains that the Grand Imperial sits on a huge amount of property, ""about as far as you can see,"" as he puts it. Baxter realizes that the hilly terrain is exactly the attraction the hotel needs; they can turn the hill adjacent to the hotel into a ski lodge. Baxter attempts to secure funding for his plans. Local banker Martin Ridgeway  expresses great interest in Baxter's daring idea, but also offers to buy the lodge in order to convert it into a boys' school in honor of the deceased uncle. Baxter declines. Ridgeway, in turn, declines to give Baxter a loan, citing him as a bad collateral risk and specifically pointing out that Baxter has no experience in hotel or restaurant management, likely making his business venture a failure. All during this exchange, Ridgeway's secretary appears quite agitated, but does not speak up. Baxter leaves the bank without a loan, but determined to find one. Baxter searches for funding elsewhere and finds a friendly banker in the next town named Mr. Wainwright ([[George Kirkpatrick  who is interested in Baxter's venture. Wainwright agrees to meet with Baxter at a ski lodge — Baxter, not willing to make the same mistake as he did with Ridgeway by admitting he knows nothing about hotels or skiing, claims to be an avid skier. Wainwright, taking Baxter at his word, takes him to a black diamond run called ""Nightmare Alley."" Faking an injury, Baxter convinces Wainwright to start without him. However, after knocking down a ski rack, Baxter is shoved by an irate skier, sending him down the run anyway. After quite a few close calls, not to mention downing more than a few other skiers, Baxter ends up crashing into a tree. The sensational story is picked up by the local press, which gives the chaos and injuries caused by Baxter's run a fair amount of coverage. While he is recovering, Martin Ridgeway gives Baxter a check for $3,000, taking feigned pity on him. Baxter starts making a list of repairs for the lodge. Meanwhile, local bumpkin Wally Perkins  works with Jesse to repair the hot water heater. The water heater explodes, tearing a hole in the kitchen wall. Ridgeway's check covers the repair, but leaves nothing for the ski lift Baxter had in mind. Jesse comes to the rescue by pulling an old donkey engine out of mothballs, tying a rope around it, and using it as a makeshift ski lift. The restored hotel opens to little fanfare, receiving few customers for several days. When Wally dynamites a tree stump from the ground, the explosion sets off an avalanche, blocking a passing train carrying several hundred skiers. The Baxters quickly shuttle the skiers to their resort. All goes well until Wally commences ski training classes. Having never taught skiing before, Wally loses his balance and skis down a steep mountain, dangling over a ledge while clinging to a pine tree. Using the donkey engine and a rope to lower John Baxter down the mountain to rescue Wally, Jesse accidentally jostles a loose piece of lit firewood onto one of the ropes anchoring the engine in place. Baxter rescues Wally, who suffers a broken arm. The burning rope tears, setting the donkey engine free. It slides down the mountain with Baxter in tow, still roped to the machine after having rescued Wally. The engine plows through the hotel. All of the guests check out, leaving the Baxters out of money once again. John Baxter sheepishly goes back to Ridgeway, asking for an extension on his loan, which Ridgeway flatly refuses. Baxter notices a sign for the Silver Hills Snowmobile Race, with $5,000 prize, a prize that has been won by Ridgeway for the last several runs of the race. Though Baxter has never used a snowmobile, he assumes Wally can drive his slapdash snowmobile. Unfortunately, Wally's broken arm from his skiing accident prevents his involvement. Baxter decides to drive the snowmobile himself, with Jesse as his partner. Baxter's wife, furious that he would risk his own safety and health and certain that the lodge has become an obsession that has eclipsed his duties to his family, threatens to leave. The day of the race, 75-year-old Jesse has second thoughts about partaking in the race aboard Wally's decrepit snowmobile . Baxter reveals that his wife has indeed left with the children, probably for Denver. After a rocky start, Baxter and McCord actually end up passing much of the pack, but a series of unfortunate turns and one unexpected shortcut ends up breaking one of the snowmobile's skis. Heading into town both in the lead and under full power due to a broken throttle, Baxter plows into a snowbank, breaking the other ski. Ridgeway makes the same mistake, and the two end up on the final stretch only seconds apart. Though they come close, Baxter and McCord narrowly miss the finish line.

Wheeler loves the job, but Danny hates it, viewing it as a mindless, dead-end job. Danny's pessimism results in the collapse of his relationship with lawyer Beth Jones , after he impulsively proposes to her. After one presentation the duo find that their Minotaur truck is being towed, as they were parked in a no-parking zone. They try driving the truck away from the tow truck, damaging the tow truck, nearly running over a policeman and crashing into a statue. They are arrested. Beth strikes a deal with the judge in which they have to log 150 hours of community service over the next 30 days, in lieu of 30 days in jail. The judge selects for their community service a big-brother style program called Sturdy Wings, led by Gayle Sweeny , a recovering addict. Gayle instantly dislikes the two and warns them that if they fail to carry out their tasks she will have them imprisoned. Wheeler is paired up with Ronnie Shields , a foul-mouthed streetwise miscreant obsessed with breasts, who has driven away all the other ""Bigs"" he has been paired with, while Danny is assigned Augie Farcques , a nerdy teenager obsessed with medieval live action role-playing games. Danny is unable to find common ground with Augie. Ronnie takes virtually no interest in Wheeler. Danny considers choosing the jail sentence, but Wheeler insists that if they go to jail, they will get raped, which Wheeler is strongly against. They gradually bond with their ""littles"". Ronnie takes an interest in Wheeler's favorite band, Kiss, and discovers that Wheeler shares his obsession with breasts, and Wheeler teaches Ronnie to control his obsession with breasts. Danny and Augie bond when they realize that they are both involved in the Sturdy Wings program against their will, and as a result Danny joins Augie's live action role playing game, ""LAIRE"" . Despite their successes, Danny attempts to reconcile with Beth, but to no avail . However, their success is cut short. When Augie manages to sneak up on the King of LAIRE, Argotron , the King lies and tells everyone that he killed Augie. Danny, backing up Augie, shoves the King, and gets himself and Augie banned from LAIRE forever. Later, Danny insults Augie's mother and stepfather for refusing to support Augie's hobby, earning their animosity. As soon as Augie's parents kick Danny out of their house, Danny quips back, ""I'd be psyched if he were my son."" Meanwhile, Wheeler takes Ronnie to a party and leaves him unsupervised, resulting in Ronnie walking home alone and a series of angry messages from his mom on Wheeler's cell-phone. Ronnie and Augie's parents ask Sturdy Wings for new mentors, and Danny and Wheeler are removed from the Sturdy Wings program, thus failing to complete their community service. Beth says that she will defend Danny and Wheeler in court, but cannot make any promises, as they will eventually be sent to jail. Danny and Wheeler argue and go their separate ways. Danny convinces King Argotron to allow himself and Augie to fight that afternoon in the much-awaited Battle Royale. Wheeler gets permission from Ronnie's mother to hang out with Ronnie after he gets out of jail, and earns Ronnie's forgiveness. However, Augie's LAIRE ""country"" of Xanthia views him as too much of a liability, and throws him out. To form a new LAIRE country, Danny and Augie need four members and matching costumes. Danny asks Wheeler and Ronnie to join them. They arrive with Wheeler's KISS costumes and a Kiss-themed Minotaur truck, naming their new country ""Kiss-My-Anthia"". After a betrayal by his former Xanthian allies, Augie finally duels with the king, defeating him. A hidden player, Sarah , who goes by Esplen in LAIRE, then attacks and defeats Augie; she is crowned the new queen and chooses Augie as her king-consort. Augie's parents forgive Danny. Impressed with having seen that Wheeler and Danny do care for the children and not simply themselves, Sweeny clears their names with the judge. Danny serenades Beth with a rendition of the KISS song ""Beth"" and they finally reconcile."

Unemployment and crime rates skyrocket, and the sharp increase of convicted criminals leads to privatized prisons for profit. The warden of Terminal Island penitentiary, Hennessey , earns profits from the pay-per-view broadcast of a modern gladiator game called “Death Race”, using the prisoners as players. The racers, along with their navigators, drive a 3-part race over 3 days on a closed track at Terminal Island. The reward for the drivers is that any racer who wins 5 races will be granted freedom by Warden Hennessey. At the end of one race, a masked driver named Frankenstein  is nearing the finish line against his only surviving competitor, rival Machine Gun Joe . His navigator, Case , reports that his defensive weapons are malfunctioning, and is ordered to eject from the car just before Joe blows it up. On the outside, Jensen Ames  struggles to live normally and provide for his family in the ruined economy. When the steel factory he works at is closed, he returns home and promises his wife that he will provide for her and their new-born daughter. He is suddenly knocked down by a mysterious assailant - waking up covered in blood, with his wife murdered. He is arrested by the police, finding he has been framed for killing his wife. Six months later Ames has been convicted and sent to Terminal Island. Hennessey informs Ames that – unknown to the public and the other racers – Frankenstein is dead, but as he was so wildly popular, she wants to keep his legend alive for the ratings. She coerces Ames to clandestinely assume the persona, with the inducement that Ames would only need to win one race to earn his freedom and take back his daughter since Frankenstein won four. She points out that, by wearing Frankenstein's mask, only a few inside people will know he's not really Frankenstein, including his maintenance crew of Coach , Gunner , and Lists . On Race Day 1, Ames meets Case, his navigator from the nearby woman's prison , who also knows he's not Frankenstein. Ames has a rough first go, coming in last place after three other racers have been terminated. His defensive weapons mysteriously malfunction, just like the previous Frankenstein's last race. Ames pieces together that one of the racers, Pachenko , was the one who killed his wife at the behest of Hennessey so she could recruit him as Frankenstein's replacement to maintain her pay-per-view profits. On Race Day 2, Ames forces Case to admit that she has been sabotaging Frankenstein’s car on the orders of Hennessey in exchange for her release papers. Case was never meant to kill Frank or Ames, just stop them from winning so Frankenstein could remain in Death Race. Ames causes Pachenko's car to crash, leaves his own car, and breaks Pachenko's neck and temporarily teams up with Machine Gun Joe to destroy a massive 18-wheel tanker with many weapons that Hennessey unexpectedly adds to the race to boost ratings, which kills three more racers before being destroyed. Only Ames and Joe survive Day 2, with Joe now aware that Ames is driving as Frankenstein. The two talk after the race. Hennessey, aware that Ames knows her angle, tries to maintain the ruse of granting him freedom but asks him to consider staying on permanently as Frankenstein. As a precaution, she has an explosive planted under his car for Race Day 3, knowing she can replace Ames with another masked Frankenstein. On Race Day 3 Ames  and Joe escape by driving their vehicles through a weakened wall discovered by examining footage of another racer's demise; Hennessey unsuccessfully tries to activate the bomb, which had already been discovered and removed by Coach and the rest of the maintenance team. Hennessey sends attack helicopters after Ames, Case, and Joe, who make it across the bridge that connects the island to the mainland  and split up. When the helicopters follow Ames under Hennessey's orders, Case offers herself as bait in the Frankenstein costume to repay the old Frank, and because she’d already been given her release papers. She is captured while Joe and Ames escape on a freight train. Hennessey, although furious about the escape, is happy about capturing Frankenstein  and also for her earning millions of dollars from the highly successful pay-per-view. She is given an anonymous gift for her record-breaking ratings; it turns out to be the bomb she originally meant for Ames, with a note saying; ""WARMEST REGARDS, YOUR MONSTER!"". At that moment, Coach remotely detonates the bomb, killing Hennessey, and proceeds to break the fourth wall by looking into the camera and saying ""I love this game"". Six months afterward, Joe, Ames, and his daughter are shown living honestly in Mexico, where they make a living fixing cars at a local used car dealership. Suddenly, Case shows up in her new modified car. Ames then reflects on how no one could love his daughter more than he does, and that she is his chance at something else, which to him is ""all that really matters""."

Nonetheless, Renny gets the divorce judge to agree to a thirty-day delay to have Steve examined by the city lunacy commission.

They are told that they have been brought together to participate in a game conceived of by The Baron, the leader of the organization, in which they have to reach his mansion within eleven hours. The reward for this is 300 million yen and the chance to start their lives over by also expunging their criminal records. Each participant is fitted with a bracelet on their left wrists which has a timer indicating how much time is left in the game, and an alarm system. The latter is triggered when ""hunters"", who work for the Black Papillon Foundation and are armed with non-lethal laser guns which will knock the participants out of the game when they are shot, come within 50 meters. The bracelets also contain hypodermic needles which will inject the wearers with a lethal poison if they attempt to take the bracelets off or time runs out, thus forcing them all to play the game or face death.  Unarmed and after being divided into three teams, the game starts. The first indication that things are not what they seem occurs shortly into the game when Big Mac is shot and killed by some hunters, revealing that the players must now try to survive against opponents with real firearms. The three teams then split up and pursue separate routes. Fake manages to get hold of a gun that Snake stole from a hunter and thus take control of his team. The team of Jingi, Oolong and Jasmine encounters hunters after emerging from a tunnel, whom they fight and defeat, but are also killed. Ace, Micro, and Tall succeed in hotwiring a car thanks to Micro's technical expertise, but Ace is killed by a hunter. Fake decides to kill a member of his team, but the arrival of some hunters and Coco's quick thinking result in his apparent demise, while Prince is shot and falls to his death. Micro meanwhile succeeds in deactivating the dead Ace's bracelet, revealing a black butterly tattoo on his wrist that both he and Tall also have. Hunters soon arrive however and kill them during an ensuing car chase. Coco and Snake manage to evade additional hunters, but Coco is wounded. With less than an hour left in the game and when the two are alone, she reveals why she hates men, but that she is glad that men like Snake exist. She gives him her compact as a token of remembrance before taking a bullet meant for him fired by Fake. Snake then confronts Fake with the revelation that except for him , all of the participants in the game have a black butterfly tattoo on their wrists, marking them as The Baron's children although they had different mothers. Fake is soon killed by a hunter and after slipping his bracelet off, Snake reaches The Baron's mansion as the last player left. Here he is greeted by Mr. K, and it is revealed that the two colluded in order to enable Mr. K to take over the Black Papillon Foundation, while Snake would be delivered the man with a crescent-shaped scar on his forehead who killed his parents years ago. Believing this man to be The Baron, Snake confronts him only to find him dead and no scar on his forehead. Mr. K then shoots Snake and reveals that he himself is also one of The Baron's children, making him the eleventh player in the game and explaining the film's title. Mr. K rigged the game set up by his father by adding actual deaths as a factor to kill off his siblings, and he also turns out to be the very man with the crescent-shaped scar who Snake seeks vengeance against. Mr. K then apparently shoots and kills Snake. Snake however, survives his wounds and later that night infiltrates a bizarre costume party that Mr. K is attending. He confronts and kills Mr. K, revealing that his life was saved by Coco's compact which he had in his jacket pocket and deflected a potentially fatal bullet just before he himself is shot and killed by Mr. K's bodyguards."

It is a lush green place near a river, containing over-sized mushrooms, living plants, and friendly woodland animals. Shortly after their arrival in the pleasant Agapeland, Stevie and Nancy discover the Marvelous Music Machine, which Stevie explains is a ""quanamatic digilator."" Stevie tries to make it work, but only succeeds in causing it to produce a loud noise, which shoves him back into the Music Machine's caretaker , The Conductor. When one of the children asks how the machine works, The Conductor simply smiles and replies: ""You put something in it [a slot on the machine], and a song comes out."" The next few minutes are spent singing songs, playing around, and learning important things. But partway into the film, the storyline  takes a twist: across the river from Agapeland, it is revealed that there is a barren, dry, creepy, dark place plagued with misery . This land is inhabited by the Pudges (three barefoot, waif-like, young characters similar to [[dwarf , and their scheming, grouchy ""friend"", Mr. Pims. Upon the transition to the miserable land, we see Mr. Pims enlist the three Pudges, Snard, Grum, and Bubort, to help him in a mastermind, wildly wacky scheme of schemes; steal Agapeland's source of happiness  so that their land may be just as lush and green. Pims also figures out a byproduct as well--once the machine is away from Agapeland, people will have to buy their happiness from him and the Pudges. Immediately, Pims puts his plan into action. He and the Pudges pack up a mule-driven wagon, raft across the river to Agapeland, and spy on Stevie, Nancy, and the conductor, waiting for a moment to steal the machine. Once the three humans leave, the Pudges try everything to get the machine away from Agapeland; however, they continually get distracted  until they finally come up with a terrific distraction: a picnic to keep Stevie, Nancy away from the music machine. Their trick works! Stevie and Nancy return from the picnic to find the machine roped up and being  lifted onto Mr. Pims' wagon. In the nick of time, Stevie uses a jack knife to cut the ropes and thwart Pims' plan , but the Music Machine has been wrecked and disformed from all of its mistreatment and no longer works. The Conductor does everything he can to fix it, but it refuses to play anything. Nancy, upon realizing that the Music Machine is ruined, cries a tear, which falls into the slot. The music machine comes back to life!"

The original group, who have been together for many years, are two straight couples, Antonio and Angelica and Roberto and Neval; and a gay former couple, Davide and Sergio. Relatively new additions to the group are Davide's current lover Lorenzo and Lorenzo's friend Roberta. Early in the movie a final member is added to the group: Paolo, an acquaintance of Lorenzo and Roberta. Although the members of the group love each other and spend much time together, there are tensions both within the group and within the three couples who make up the group. Antonio and Angelica seem to be a perfect couple, but their two young children are clearly dysfunctional, and Antonio is carrying on a secret affair with a florist. Roberto feels like an outsider, because while Neval is a core member of the group he is not. And although Davide and Lorenzo look like the epitome of a beautiful, affluent gay couple, Paolo's entry into the group stirs up hidden currents of competition and infidelity that begin to test the relationship. During a dinner party in Davide's apartment, Lorenzo without warning suffers an aneurism and falls into a coma from which he does not recover. His friends are deeply shaken by his death; problems that have until then been hidden begin to emerge and threaten to destroy the group; and Davide almost commits suicide. They all finally convene at Davide's idyllic retreat in the mountains overlooking the sea, and slowly the wounds begin to heal.

He has recently returned to his home town and purchased an old guest house on the outskirts of town, which he is renovating with his young daughter Hillary . When local bus driver Oscar arrives with a tour group from ""South California"", their leader insists on renting out the rooms at the guest house, pointedly rejecting Ben's suggestion that they could stay at his friends' large hotel in the middle of town. Wilson soon begins to note their peculiar behaviour, manner and dress and Oscar points out the fact that, while they purport to be tourists, they do not carry cameras or take photographs. Shortly after they settle into their rooms another stranger, Quish ([[David Wells , arrives to join the group, and Ben notices the odd fact that Quish's clothes have a fine covering of ash. Ben's suspicions are heightened by events of the next day. Quish has a minor accident while walking through the town and Wilson helps him, in the process recovering Quish's dropped American passport. Looking through it, Ben discovers that the stamps within include locations inside the United States and dates that are many decades apart. The local doctor then shows Ben an X-ray of Quish's head, which reveals that there is a mysterious object embedded in his skull. As they leave the surgery, Wilson confronts Quish, having deduced that the stamps correspond to the times and places of famous disasters, including the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake, the crash of the Hindenburg and the Mt St. Helens volcanic eruption . Unnerved, Quish will only respond by warning Wilson to leave town immediately and not return until he is sure it is safe. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Ben, his vengeful father-in-law, Judge Caldwell  &mdash; who blames Ben for his daughter's death &mdash; has secretly arranged to have Hilary taken away from Ben on the grounds that he is an unfit parent. When Ben returns home he finds Hilary gone and confronts the Judge but is threatened with arrest; defeated, he goes to stay at the local hotel. There he visited by Reeve, one of the Tourists, who confirms his suspicions about their true nature: they are time-travellers from the future who visit the scenes of famous disasters as part of a ""Grand Tour"" of the past. She then gives Ben a euphoric substance and seduces him, leaving him unconscious. Late that night Ben he is found and revived by Oscar and they return to the guest house to find out why the Tourists have come, but minutes later the town is struck by a large meteorite, resulting in almost total destruction. Ben races to the Judge's shattered home, where he finds Hilary alive; heading back into town he finds the hotel destroyed and his friends dead, while the Tourists stroll through the devastation with an air of detached fascination. Ben and Hilary work through the night helping the survivors, who are taken to Hilary's local school, which has become the local disaster relief centre. When Ben and Oscar return to the guest house the next day, Ben is alarmed to discover that, although the tourists have left the house, their luggage is still there. He and Oscar track them to an abandoned factory outside the town, where Ben realises that they are awaiting a second disaster which is about to strike the school. The tourists try to detain him but he evades them and races to the scene hoping to save Hilary. Meanwhile, maintenance workers accidentally damage a gas pipe line in the boiler room of the school and just as Ben arrives a hurricane lamp in the gymnasium ignites the leaking gas, destroying the school in a massive blast and killing most of the people inside, including Hilary and Quish, who has followed Ben to the building. Ben regains consciousness to find that he has been taken prisoner by the Tourists and that an official from their time, the Undersecretary , has arrived to investigate and try to remedy the disruptions to Ben's ""Timescape"". He explains that his people have discovered that time is more resilient than they had first believed but, because of the changes enacted by Ben and the Tourists, all time excursions have been suspended pending a full investigation. Just before they depart Ben attacks Reeve for her lack of humanity, but as she leaves she embraces him, secretly slipping Quish's passport into his hand. On examining the passport Ben discovers that it conceals one of the Tourists' time travel devices. He eventually makes it work, and returns to the previous evening to try and save his daughter and the townsfolk from the disaster. Realising that Hilary is then at her grandfather's house, he tries to sneak her away but he is caught and thrown into jail, which is itself soon to be destroyed. However he convinces the deputy to allow him his one phone call and manages to contact his pre-existing self at the hotel, just as that self is meeting with Reeve. This alternate self helps the 'original' Ben to escape from the jail and together they manage to alert and save most of the people by ringing the bells in the old church on the other side of town. Leaving Hilary with his 'earlier' self, the 'original' Ben walks through the scene of the impact; there he is again confronted by the Undersecretary, who had returned to take Ben back to his proper point in time. He warn Ben not to interfere any further and threatens to alter the past again to eliminate Ben's actions, but Ben challenges him by arguing that if the Undersecretary's assertions were true, his people would have already done so. In the final scene, we see Hilary taking bookings for the now-completed guest house while Ben reads through old love letters from his late wife. When Hilary looks up, Ben has vanished, and as the movie closes Hilary suddenly hears and is drawn towards the sound of someone playing her mother's favourite tune on the piano."

She also has trouble doing what she is told by the residents. Because of her friendship with Alice, Ellie decides to help her feel better by taking her down to the river  and giving her marijuana to ease her pain. The next day, however, Ellie finds out that Alice has died. Kate gets news that their mother had a stroke and decides to be with her. She asks Ellie to stay behind with the four residents that are staying over the Christmas holiday because Ellie and her mother do not get along. Georgia Platts  is a former actress and singer. The Nightingale sisters, Heather  and Hazel , are spinsters who moved in after spending years taking care of their mother. Donald Vanston  is a recovering alcoholic who enjoys playing piano and used to be a judge. These four residents are driving out others with their eccentric ways.

Donald requests his breakfast in his room at 6 o'clock instead of in the dining room at the usual time at 8. After he gets upset that his order is wrong, she tells him that he can have breakfast in the dining room like everyone else. Donald reveals to Ellie that the music he plays at night is his late wife's favorite song and that he regrets not sobering up before she died. Heather demands that she be given any letters addressed to her sister to keep from upsetting her. However, Kate neglected to tell Ellie this and she got a letter for Hazel from the postman. When Ellie goes to give the letter to Hazel in her room, she notices sketches and paintings in her room and realizes that Hazel is a talented artist. Hazel finds Ellie in her room and demands that she leave. Ellie then slips the letter under the door.

The researcher Maple White , together with his assistant Azbek , discovers an unknown world populated by dinosaurs, situated on a plateau in Mongolia. After having found a dinosaur's egg in a cave, White celebrates the discovery, with Azbek, uncorking a bottle of champagne and listening to classical music. Azbek is attacked and killed by Dimorphodons, which also attack White who falls from the plateau holding onto a rope; he survives but is seriously wounded, White is found again and taken care of by Myar and Djena , respectively Azbek's brother and sister; White asks the two to bring him his friend George Challenger  to whom White gives an account of his adventures, proposing to Challenger that he should try to fully explore the plateau in his place. Challenger returns to London, and organizes a lecture to try to convince some people to finance an expedition to prove that dinosaurs still exist despite scientific belief to the contrary. During the lecture, Challenger is derided and humiliated, not only from the students but also from his colleagues Leo Summerlee  and Lord Thomas . However, Lord Thomas ultimately grants permission for the expedition, on the condition that Summerlee accompany Challenger to act as ""a critical eye"". Subsequently, a spectator at the lecture, Oscar Perreault , proposes to pay the expedition's expenses to Mongolia, on the condition that the scientists capture a living dinosaur and to exhibit it to the public wherever he wishes; and that his associate John Roxton David Nerman goes along to represent his interests. Challenger unwillingly accepts the proposal. After concluding the lecture, Challenger bumps into the young journalist Arthur Malone, who he suggests joins the expedition as a documentor. After granting permission to Malone, Challenger is confronted by the same woman who had interrupted his lecture earlier- who reveals herself to be none other than the late Dr. White's daughter, Amanda, who also insists on joining the team in order to represent her father's interests. In the following days, the team heads to Mongolia, stopping on the journey to pick up their guides, including the young siblings Myar and Djena; as the journey goes on, Djena becomes very attached to Malone and strong connection is built between the two. Their transportation suffers a breakdown and the team is forced to continue the trip on foot. One of the guides is killed by what is presumably a prehistoric insect, however, despite misgivings on the part of the guides, the team continues on after conducting a funeral, according to the local rites. The team finally reaches the foot of the plateau where Amanda White is abducted by two natives. Upon noticing Amanda's disappearance the team immediately goes in search of her. Challenger and Roxton quickly find her suspended from a ritual framework by her abductors. In rescuing her, they are also forced to face the native tribe - who are only defeated by use of modern weaponry. The team escapes the charging natives by use of a hot air balloon, in which they fly up the plateau. Using binoculars Summerlee observes three Quetzalcoatlus nearby; the animals prove to be hostile and immediately attack the balloon, knocking the young Myar from it and then causing an irreparable tear to the balloon itself, causing the whole team to plummet to the plateau below. Upon arriving the team is amazed to see a Brontosaurus. After a search the team find shelter in a cave, where they discover a series of intricate symbols on the walls. Roxton decides to return to the wreckage of the balloon to recover his supplies. Upon his return he presents the team with a small Centrosaurus which he wants to sell for $100,000. Roxton the reveals to the team that he intends to make the plateau an area exclusively for high-risk game hunting, and has planned to do so all along. Roxton then orders Malone to tie Djena and Challenger to tie Malone. Taking advantage of Roxton's temporary distraction, Challenger succeeds in disarming Roxton instead and recovers the rifle. However, Roxton aims a knife Djena's neck, forcing Challenger to return the rifle to him. Djena once again distracts Roxton by biting Roxton's hand and Challenger attacks him; ultimately Challenger is able to render Roxton unconscious. Meanwhile, Amanda White and Professor Summerlee are busy trying to decipher the symbols on the cave walls. They are attacked by a dinosaur but are able to fight it off. At the same time, Challenger, Malone and Djena are returning with the tied-up Roxton, and are attacked by a giant crocodile. The crock manages to snap only Roxton, leaving the other three mostly unscathed. Returning to the cave, Amanda White tells the Mongolia's lost world history through the symbols; these tell of a tribe, the kerraks, that have adapted to the place, some dinosaurs were chased by the kerraks, some of which were extinguished and, for this, the native precedents, the neanderthals, chased the kerraks to avoid the total destruction of the lost world, becoming the plateau's custodians. After the story, Professor Summerlee reveals to the team that he doesn't want to return to London, deciding to pass the rest of his life in studying the plateau's environment. Shortly after this a neanderthal appears in the cave, and shoots Summerlee with a blow-gun. The dart causes Summerlee to become very disoriented and experience hallucinations. Under its influence he wanders from the cave and is killed by a Tyrannosaurus. The rest of the team finds the dead body of Summerlee, which they cover with a British flag; subsequently. Returning to the cave, Amanda White and Challenger discover that there is, in fact, a larger cave behind the first, the same one discovered by Maple White in the film's first scenes. Exploring the cave the two come across the skeleton of the unlucky Azbek and White's vinyal record. In the same instant, a battered John Roxton, reveals to Amanda White and to Challenger that the cave is full of explosive and that the two cannot be not be saved once he lights the fuse. Roxton is also in possession of a Dimorphodon, which frees itself and attacks him, causing him to fall from the plateau. Before falling however, Roxton manages to light the fuse and Amanda and Challenger barely succeed in escaping. While trying to prepare a parachute, Djena finds a dead velociraptor and is attacked by small eoraptors, which then attack the other team members. Later that night, a Tyrannosaurus attacks the camp; the team tries to escape, but Djena is once again attacked by the small eoraptors, when they disperse Djena is attacked and killed by the T-Rex. Wanting to avenge Djena, Malone distracts the T-Rex by throwing rocks at it . He is ultimately able to kill the T-Rex with a large blast of fire by igniting flammable gas caused by a nearby volcano. Amanda White and Challenger are saved from the hot flash by throwing themselves down from the plateau's frame with the parachute that Deja had been preparing earlier. Returning to London, Challenger communicates the death of his companions to the students. On account of the dangerousness of the place, he chooses to state that the expedition found nothing, thus making sure that no one else goes looking for the plateau. In the last scenes of the film, we see that Malone - the film's narrator - has remained on the plateau and adapted to life there."

A mysterious new Sinterklaas named Jan  replaces him. Just a short while after his public appearance, he jumps into water to save a little girl who falls into it, and then he runs away from the crowd and disappears. He is found by the production assistant of the television show next day, and agrees to appear in television shows on knowing that playing Sinterklaas is a paid job. He becomes quite popular on television because of his alternative style. Klaasje  has left her husband Dennis , because he cheated on her with a young and attractive elementary school teacher . Dennis wants her back, but his chances seem to plummet when she has a fling with a 16-year-old boy , whom she meets during the funeral of her father, the deceased actor who used to play Sinterklaas annually. Klaasje’s best friend Simone , the mother of the girl rescued by Sinterklaas, is the linchpin in her family. Her husband Ted  often feels redundant. He loses his job, but he is afraid to tell his dominant wife about it. Swimming instructor Victor  looks forward to marrying his love Kees , an undertaker. But Kees has doubts and fears about committed life. During the marriage ceremony, he walks away without saying ‘yes’. Victor's sister Kiki , a saleswoman at the jewellery section of De Bijenkorf, has always dreamt of a Prince Charming. During the arrival of Sinterklaas, Kiki almost runs into Crown Prince Valentine , while driving a horse carriage. Kiki is dressed as a campaign gift and the prince takes her in his arms as she tries to get down from the carriage. Prince Valentine falls in love with her. Next morning he visits De Bijenkorf to see Kiki. But Kiki desists from seeing him, and rejects him on the grounds that he will not take her seriously. To still come into contact with her, Prince Valentine dresses as Black Peter, does antics at De Bijenkorf for work. In the evening, he  offers to drop her home and ends up having a wild night with her. The next morning, however, he sneaks away through the window without saying goodbye to Kiki. Kiki follows him to his hotel and confronts him. It turns out that Kiki knew all along that Prince Valentine was playing Black Pieter but just wanted to see how far he would go for her. They end up kissing each other. On the night of Sinterklaas Eve, the Jan again runs away before his appearance in the show. He is spotted by Ted who recognizes him to be the one who had rescued his daughter from water. Ted invites Jan, dressed as Sinterklaas, for a beer to his house. All the children of the town slowly flock around him as word secretively spreads among them that he is there. The television crew also eventually comes there. During his TV interview, he speaks candidly about his life and his regrets. He also tells that the name of his son is Kees and that he left his son while his son was three. The 5th December Special TV show comes to an end and Sinterklass is seen walking out of on the snowy street. As he walks and looks around, all the couples are shown one by one to have found out what to do with their lives. Having found his father on the television show, Kees drives with Victor to meet him.

While speeding down a dirt road, they hit and kill a grizzly bear cub, sending their Jeep Cherokee into a tree and cracking the radiator. As they argue over whether they should bury the dead cub, they hear its mother coming and run. The vehicle overheats down the road so Wes and Ritch go into the forest to find water. The bear finds and attacks Ritch. Having heard Ritch's screams to run, Wes inadvertently runs into the bear and it attacks him. The other two arrive and rescue Wes, but are unable to help Ritch. The bear kills him while the others flee to the Jeep. The vehicle starts again and they leave, but Wes panics and tries to force Sean to turn around and go back for Ritch, causing the car to go over a cliff. Calmer, he wants to wait for help, but no one knows where they are because they had told their families they were going somewhere else. They winch the vehicle back up to the road, but they cannot get it to start. Sean leaves to jog the {{convert}} out of the forest to find help while Wes and Lauren wait at the Jeep. He comes across some run down buildings where he finds a hunting paraphernalia, a bear trap, and dead animals. As he leaves, the bear appears. He tries to sneak past the bear, but instead he runs into the bear and it throws him on the roof of the shack and then he falls into a chicken coop. Hours later he makes it back to the Jeep, but his leg is injured. Wes decides to climb a tall hill on the other side of the clearing to see if he can get a signal on his cell phone. It does not work and the bear nearly catches him. He quickly climbs back down and gets back to the Jeep though it still will not start. He and Lauren hide in the Jeep with the wounded Sean in the back. The bear follows and climbs on top of the Jeep, smashing up the car and eventually overturning it before leaving as the sun sets. Sean wakes up and tells them about the hunting paraphernalia, crying about wanting to go home before he dies. Wes and Lauren turn the Jeep right side up, load him back in the car, then push the Jeep down the hilly road as a thunderstorm hits. Using the downward momentum and occasionally pushing, they arrive near the buildings. While Lauren is exploring the building with the trap, the bear swings at her through a window sending her back against the trap, which impales her back. She returns to the vehicle where the bear rips off the tailgate and drags away Sean's body. Wes grabs a can of gasoline and pours a trail from the Jeep to the woods. They lure the bear to it and then set the gasoline on fire. The Jeep explodes, but the bear is unharmed. They decide to try another plan and split up. Wes climbs a tree, leaving his blood covered clothes on the ground to fool the bear. While the bear is sniffing at the clothes, Wes accidentally drops a tire iron, calling the bear's attention up. The bear shakes him out of the tree but he escapes and goes to the shack where Lauren has built a trap. They lure the bear into the shack, and use a trigger to close the front door behind it, locking it in. They celebrate and start to leave but the bear breaks out of the shack and they both try to escape. Unfortunately, Wes stumbles and Lauren tries to get him back up, refusing to leave him behind despite his desperate insistence that she should run.

Although the anti-Fascist sentiment in her acceptance speech gets her labeled a ""commie"" by some observers, she and Biberman  are placed under contract at Warner Bros. He first comes under scrutiny more for his Jewish background than his political activities. Yet, with Cold War paranoia growing, a group of Hollywood directors and actors — Biberman, Sondergaard, Danny Kaye, and Dalton Trumbo among them—are labeled Communists and questioned before Congress. After refusing to testify against his colleagues, he is imprisoned in the Federal Correctional Institution at Texarkana for a period of six months. Once released, he discovers his Hollywood career is finished.  Sondergaard suggests her husband direct a screenplay about the real-life 1950-51 strike waged by Mexican-American miners against the Empire Zinc Company in Bayard, New Mexico written by Michael Wilson, also a victim of the blacklist, and Biberman's brother Michael. She feels the lead role of Esperanza Quintero, who rallied the wives of the unemployed miners and urged them to support their husbands, is an ideal way to jump-start her stagnating career. Biberman agrees, but after meeting with the people who participated in the strike and being inspired by their passion, he decides all roles should be played by ethnic actors. Because the film has no studio backing and most Hollywood players fear being associated with Biberman and the project, he eventually casts local residents from Grant County, New Mexico and members of the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers, Local 890 to fill most of the roles. Juan Chacón, the Union Local president, is cast as the fiery Ramon Quintero opposite Mexican actress Rosaura Revueltas as his wife Esperanza. Will Geer is one of only five Hollywood actors to accept a role in the production. The FBI investigates the film's financing, attempts to steal the film's negatives, tells film-processing labs not to work on the film when they are unable to locate them, incites locals who are unhappy with the film crew's presence to set fire to many of the sets, and eventually deports Revueltas on bogus charges. Biberman stands his ground and completes the film, using scenes with Revueltas that were shot in her native Mexico and then smuggled into the US."

Embarking on an expedition as a young boy, Temüjin  is accompanied by his father Yesügei  to select a girl as his future wife. Temüjin meets and chooses Börte , although his father wishes him to choose a mate from the Merkit tribe. Temüjin convinces his father to allow him to choose Börte. He promises to return after five years to marry her. On their way home, Temüjin's father is poisoned by an enemy tribe. As he lies dying, he tells Temüjin that he is now Khan. However, one of his father's warriors, Targutai , orders the other tribesmen to loot the dead Khan's camp. Targutai spares Temüjin's life, declaring a Mongol does not kill children. After falling through the ice of a frozen lake, Temüjin is found lying down in the snow by a young boy called Jamukha . The two quickly become friends and perform a traditional ceremony declaring themselves blood brothers. Targutai later captures Temüjin, holding him in captivity. Temüjin however, escapes late one night and roams the countryside. Temüjin is later seen again as a young man  in 1186. He once again is apprehended by Targutai, who wishes to kill him now that he is grown. Temüjin escapes a second time finding Börte , and brings her back to his family. Later that night, they are attacked by the Merkit tribe led by Chiledu , since Temüjin's father had years before stolen his wife from one of their tribesmen. While being chased on horseback, Temüjin is shot with an arrow. Börte whips the horse which Temüjin is on, telling it to go home. Börte is captured by the Merkit leader, as Temüjin returns safely to his family. Temüjin is sold to a Tangut Garrison Chief , despite the dire warning given to the man by a Buddhist monk  acting as his advisor, who senses the great potential the warrior carries and his future role in subjugating the Tangut state. While imprisoned, the monk pleads with Temüjin to save his monastery when he is set free sometime in the future. In exchange for delivering a bone fragment to Börte indicating that he is still alive, Temüjin agrees. Thereafter, the monk succeeds in delivering the bone and the message, though at the cost of his life. As a means of getting to Tangut, Börte becomes a merchant's concubine, bearing a daughter along the way. Once Börte arrives in Tangut, she abandons the merchant and bribes the guard for the key to Temüjin's cell, and the two manage to escape back to their homeland. Temüjin, upset by the increasing loss of traditional values in Mongol society, leaves his family once more and pledges to make the Mongols abide by the law. Visiting a holy site in the mountains, he drafts an early version of the Jasagh and prays to ""The Lord of the Great Blue Sky"" for assistance. Subsequently, he gathers an army to unify all of the Mongols. In 1196, Temüjin declares war over Jamukha. By 1206, Temüjin engages Jamukha, in league with his old enemy, Targutai, in battle. However, a thunderstorm arises on the steppe, terrifying Jamukha's troops and causing their unconditional surrender, as Temüjin stands triumphant . Having defeated his ""blood brother"", Temüjin allows Jamukha to live, while Targutai is killed by his own soldiers while attempting to flee the battle. The traitorous men are ordered to be executed by Temüjin, who surprises them when he informs them that they broke his primary tenet: ""Never betray your Khan."" Afterwards, Temüjin is designated the Khan of all the Mongols – Genghis Khan of the Great Steppe. The final pre-credits sequence indicates that Genghis Khan would later go on to invade and conquer the Tangut Empire by 1227, fulfilling the monk's prophecy. However, the film clarifies that, while the entire civilization was ravaged by the Mongol horde, the Buddhist monastery Temüjin pledged never to destroy remained intact, thereby indicating the great integrity and honesty of the Khan."

James P. Hoffa had been elected president of the Teamsters in the fall of 1998, and had campaigned on a promise to unionize Overnite and securing a contract for its 13,000 workers. The Teamsters represented only a fraction of Overnite's workers, but believed they could use other means to win company recognition of the union. Initially, about 2,000 workers walked the picket line in 12 states. The strike turned violent, however, and both sides accused the other of bribery, spying, intimidation and more. By August 2002, only 300 to 600 workers remained on strike. The Teamsters called the strike off without securing a contract or union recognition.Greenhouse, ""Teamsters End 3-Year Strike Against Trucker Without Contract,"" New York Times, October 26, 2002. American Standoff focuses primarily on two Teamster members and a staff organizer and how they are affected by the strike. However, the film roves over the entire United States, visiting Memphis, Atlanta, Chicago, Boston, and Las Vegas. The strike is placed in the context of Hoffa's struggle to secure his political base within the Teamsters' union. Hoffa not only faced political attacks from union reformers but also from other union leaders who believed they could unseat the newly-elected president in the 2002 election.Greenhouse, ""Bitter 6-Month Strike at Overnite Poses a Test for Teamsters' Chief,"" New York Times, May 7, 2000. The internecine struggle for power in the Teamsters limits the effectiveness of the union's response, although Hoffa appears to emerge stengthened.Ross, ""INTERVIEW: Behind The Strike Lines: 'American Standoff' Director Kristi Jacobson Chronicles the Teamsters,"" IndieWire, June 7, 2002. The film concludes in mid-2001, with the strike still lingering, workers increasingly disenchanted, and the union struggling to find an acceptable exit strategy."

Immediately afterward, Scott and Marcia , both light-skinned enough to look white, are married. Scott has landed an internship, but his fellow graduate, the dark-skinned Jesse Pridham ([[Ray Saunders , wonders if he will have to work as a Pullman porter until there is an opening in a black hospital. In Georgia, the black hospital director tells Scott that the board of directors has decided to give preference to ""Southern"" applicants, and rescinds the job offer. Marcia insists her husband continue searching for another medical job. In the meantime, they live in Boston with Marcia's parents, who have successfully passed for white. Her father and some of their black friends suggest they do the same. Instead, Scott continues to openly apply as a Negro, only to be rejected time and time again. Scott finally gives in, quits his job making shoes, and masquerades as white for a one-year internship in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. While there, Scott responds to an emergency. At an isolated lighthouse, he has to operate immediately on a sport fisherman who is bleeding to death from a penetrating duodenal ulcer. His patient turns out to be Dr. Walter Bracket , a well-known director of a clinic. Impressed, the recovering Dr. Bracket offers him the position of town doctor in Keenham, New Hampshire, replacing Bracket's father, who recently died after 50 years of service. Scott turns down the offer, explaining that he is a Negro. Dr. Bracket, though he admits he would not have made the offer had he known, recommends Scott take the job without revealing his race. With a baby on the way, Scott reluctantly agrees. The child's birth is cause for much worry. To everyone's relief, the boy looks white. When the local rector and his wife welcome the new residents, Marcia tells them her boy will be named after Scott's mentor, Dr. Charles Howard. The rector tells Marcia he met a doctor by that name. However, he assumes it must not be the same one, since that Dr. Howard was black. Scott slowly earns the trust and respect of the residents. By 1942, when the United States enters World War II, the Carters are pillars of the community. Their son, Howard, attends the University of New Hampshire, while daughter Shelly  is in high school. The Carters have managed to keep their secret, even from their own children. Scott goes to Boston once a week to work at the Charles Howard Clinic, which he and Jesse Pridham established for patients of all races. Howard invites Arthur Cooper , a black classmate, to Keenham. Shelly worries what her friends will think about a ""coon"" staying in their home. Scott sternly orders her never to use that word again. When Arthur goes to a party with Howard, a few guests make bigoted remarks behind his back. Howard and Scott both enlist in the Navy.

When Tony is promoted to Colonel and is about to retire from the NASA space program, Jeannie decides to give him a celebration party in their backyard. However, egged on by his colleagues to retire with a dramatic flair, Tony breaks his promise to Jeannie for one more space flight , this time with a female astronaut, Captain Nelly Hunt. Jeannie is furious, so she decides to separate from her husband temporarily to be a more independent modern woman. In the meantime, Jeannie's always-scheming evil sister, Jeannie II is determined to have Tony for herself and she teams up with Haji, the chief genie , to break up her sister's marriage. Jeannie II traps her sister in a bottle with a special stopper, that nobody but another genie could open. Meanwhile, Tony's space flight is in trouble; the engines won't fire and the shuttle's on collision course with a meteoroid. When T.J. comes home and hears his mother trapped in the bottle, he attempts to open the bottle, but after many times of blinking, like his mother does to invoke her powers, the stopper moves, which shows that T.J. also had inherited his mother's powers and is a genie. After blinking, and releasing his mother from her prison, Jeannie and T.J. go to Haji, explaining the trick. Rules must have changed since 1970, because Jeannie now needs special dispensation from the chief of genies in order to do something major, like saving a human life. Haji will give Jeannie that special dispensation... if she agrees to end her relationship with Tony. T.J. tells his mother that they'll lose dad either way, so they might as well do it so Tony lives. Jeannie invokes her magic, saving the shuttle from certain doom, and it is able to return to the ground. However, Jeannie got Haji to agree to one final night together for her and Tony, allowing Jeannie to say farewell to Tony in her heart. Jeannie then alters the bedroom and then the house to what it might look like if Tony was a bachelor; doubtless, Haji arranged for everyone to forget about Jeannie. With T.J., Jeannie moves on with her life. The final scene shows Jeannie and Tony passing each other on the street, and Jeannie magically gets Tony's attention, indicating that they will in fact find each other again. Before the movie ends, Jeannie says ""Haji made me agree to an ending. He never said there couldn't be a new beginning"". The movies ends with Tony following Jeannie down the street."

One day, while running through the streets of Oxford to attend the bestowing of an honorary degree on his friend the Prime Minister, Sebastian runs into Rebecca  Howard and her jeep. After insulting Sebastian on the spot, Becky is intrigued by him and follows him to the ceremony. After Becky is able to spell her own name backwards, he gives her a phone number to call if she wants an unspecified ""job."" Becky calls the number, and after Sebastian's personal assistant Miss Elliott describes the job as being part of the ""civil service,"" Becky is turned off by the idea. Overcoming her concerns, she calls again, and after a successful interview, obtains a job deciphering codes used by secret agents and foreign spies. Once settled in her new job, Becky slowly starts to fall for the aloof Mr Sebastian. However, problems arise when Gen. John Phillips, Head of Security, accuses Sebastian's senior Jewish decoder Elsa Shahn of being a poor security risk, because of her left-wing Communist leanings. Sebastian convinces the Head of Intelligence to retain Shahn despite Phillips' objections, expressing how vital Shahn is to the decoding office and reaffirming that she enjoys his full confidence. Eventually, Becky and Sebastian engage in an affair, which upsets Sebastian's longtime girlfriend  Carol Fancy. Ultimately, Shahn betrays Sebastian's trust by providing recently decoded information to a left-wing political organisation. When confronted with the security breach by the Head of Intelligence and by Phillips' watchdog Jameson, Sebastian tenders his resignation and breaks up with Becky, thinking she was on to him. He leaves London and returns to his teaching position at Oxford University. Months later, Sebastian is visited at Oxford by the Head of Intelligence, who convinces Sebastian to return, temporarily, to the decoding office to help the Americans decipher some unidentified signals emanating from a Sputnik-type Russian spy satellite circling the earth. To prepare for this assignment, Sebastian visits a secret British eavesdropping installation, where he meets the American Ackerman , who is working on the project. One day, while looking for Becky, who has also left the decoding department after Sebastian's resignation and break-up, Sebastian runs into Carol, who invites him to a party at her apartment ""for old times sake"". At the party, Sebastian is drugged with LSD and lured to the top of the building by Toby, who unknown to Sebastian, is both Carol's lover and a foreign agent. Just as the hallucinating Sebastian is about to jump off the building ledge to his death at Toby's insistence, he is saved by Gen. Phillips, who had been tailing both men, and Toby is arrested. Sebastian returns to the decoding office, and finds out where Becky lives. While visiting Becky, Sebastian discovers that he is the father of her newborn baby. During this visit, a noise from the baby's rattle provides Sebastian with the solution to the Soviet spy satellite's signals, which he eventually breaks with the help of his faithful group of decoding girls, who are summoned to Becky's apartment to decipher the Soviet code."

Bruce, over a spurious map showing a sliver of land on the Eastern Seaboard labeled ""USA"", with all land to its west labeled ""INJUN JOE'S TERRITORY"". Porky Pig is leading a wagon train to California and he must keep an eye out for the Herculean Native American ""Super Chief"", Injun Joe. The name is a play on the famous Santa Fe train run of the same name , and reinforced by each character spouting smoke and crying ""Woo-woo!"" like a steam locomotive, each time they say Injun Joe's name. Porky and Injun Joe are repeatedly interrupted by a goofy bearded hillbilly named Sloppy Moe , who keeps repeating, ""I know something I won't tell, I won't tell, I won't tell!"" to the tune of London Bridge is Falling Down. This goes on until Injun Joe corners Porky with tomahawk in hand, and Sloppy Moe sings his refrain once more. Injun Joe grabs him and demands, ""What you know, Huh???"", and Sloppy reveals his secret at last, ""Injun... Joe... is... ticklish!"", and proceeds to prove that by tickling the chief with his hands and beard. The Native American goes into a raucous laughing fit. Distracted, he backs off a cliff and falls deep into the ground, pulling the surface down with him, and causing the map seen at the beginning of the cartoon to stretch the ""USA"" sliver across to the west coast, so that it now reads ""UNITED STATES of AMERICA"" from west to east. The cartoon closes with the narrator returning to lionize the cartoon's heroes, Porky and Sloppy Moe, and irises-out with Moe tickling the giggling Porky."

The daughter of bitter, fearful, poverty-stricken colonials, the Girl is a pretty waif who wears an old silk dress and a man's fedora and paint her lips bright red when out of her mother's sight. She and her family are French, but live in Vietnam where her mother is a schoolteacher to local children. Her weak-willed mother, violent older brother, and timid younger brother live in a rural section across the river. The girl is a loner but an excellent student, who dreams of being a writer. She meets the Chinaman when crossing the river on the ferry, returning to the city after a school holiday ended. He is the son of a Chinese businessman whose fortune was made in real estate, and has recently returned from Paris after dropping out of school. He has the look but lacks the self-assurance of the playboy he fancies himself to be, and he is mesmerized the first time he sees her standing by the rail on a crowded ferry crossing the Mekong River. After some awkward conversation, he offers her a ride to Saigon in his chauffeur-driven limousine and she accepts, although the two barely speak during the drive. The Girl gives her age at the beginning of the film as 15, but lies to The Chinaman by stating that she is 17. He lies to her, telling her he is 32. The following day, he waits for her outside her boarding school, and the two go to the room he rents for entertaining mistresses in the seedy Chinese quarter, where they make love. They realize that ""a future together is unthinkable"" because she is scheduled to return to Paris soon, and he is arranged to marry a Chinese heiress. Aware of the limited time they have together, they fall into a relationship in which they shed all responsibilities that come with commitment. Every day after school, the girl goes to the bachelor room. The girl's family discovers the affair, and though at first angry, they encourage her to continue because the Chinaman is wealthy and able to pay off some of their debts. Despite this added tension, the affair continues passionately. The Chinaman even goes so far as to beg his father for the allowance to be with the girl instead of entering into his arranged marriage, but his father would rather see him dead than with a ""white girl."" Though both devastated, the Chinaman marries his arranged bride, and the girl boards a ship days later to return to France. Decades later, the girl is a successful writer. The Chinaman telephones her, as he is visiting France with his wife. He assured her that he never stopped loving her, and that he would not stop for the rest of his life."

Stella, convinced that her husband is insane, leaves him and meets Ward. Phillip phones them and promises to grant her a divorce if Ward will talk with him in person. Despite Stella's misgivings, Ward agrees to see him. However, Phillip provokes a loud argument and Ward leaves. Afterwards, the madman kills himself, carefully framing Ward for the crime. Ward is arrested, convicted of murder and sentenced to be executed. A frantic Stella is unable to convince anyone of his innocence. The day before the execution, she is visited by Dr. Rameau , a psychiatrist who had been treating Phillip. He is convinced that Phillip committed suicide and that he would have left some message bragging about it. They go to the Monrell mansion and start searching. Mrs. Monrell  reveals that her son kept diaries; then, Clark , the butler, recalls that he mailed a package to Paris. They take a flight to France and find the book, which exonerates Ward.

Armed with two revolvers and a handful of grenades, they plan an unauthorised mission to occupied France. They write to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, explaining their intention to fight the Germans. After they finally succeed in getting to France, they stumble across a German radar station. They blow up what they take to be the main operations room, and then the entire compound unexpectedly erupts with gunfire and explosions. They narrowly evade the Germans and escape in a boat which is later blown up by a mine; the men are picked up by the British and interrogated as possible spies. Once their identities have been established, they are returned to barracks to be court-martialed as deserters. An aide of Winston Churchill had seen their letter, and knew of a commando raid on the radar facility which was facilitated by a diversion due to mysterious explosions in what they discover was actually the cookhouse. The aide intervenes in the court martial, establishes their presence at the enemy radar station and conveys an invitation to tea with the Prime Minister should they ever be in Whitehall. The court nevertheless demotes Sergeant King to the rank of corporal and remands Private Cuthbertson to military prison for 28 days, lenient sentences for desertion in wartime. A note on screen tells the viewer that the men never meet again.

She returns to America, but her friend and secretary, Sylvia Lockwood , impersonates her in a meeting with the managers of her fortune. After seeing how happy Sylvia is with her new husband, Phillip ([[Reginald Denny , she broaches the topic of setting a wedding date with Donald , her longtime fiancé.

However, it is too late to cancel the party in which she had planned to announce their wedding. At the party, Dorothy and Sylvia continue pretending to be each other. Dorothy meets Anthony ""Tony"" Travers  and, after winning $60 from him playing billiards, takes a great liking to him. However, stung by Donald's confession that he was never sure he was attracted to her or her money, Dorothy decides to see if Tony would prefer her to the woman Tony thinks is her. She does all in her power to encourage him to court ""Dorothy"", even lending him money to do so. Connors warns her that she is being foolish, that no man could resist choosing such a seemingly wealthy and beautiful woman, but Dorothy is adamant. Sylvia and Phillip reluctantly play along. Tony is invited to a weekend retreat. Connors, Sylvia, and Phillip arrive a day late, using the bad weather as an excuse to give Dorothy time alone with Tony .

Since the end of the war, he has been living with his family and father at the expense of his brother-in-law, Nando. One day he receives a letter that says he has been given a job as carrier in the town's markets, despite his request to join the local police. Unwilling to accept the new job, he manages to meet the town's Mayor  and get the position he sought for. As a policeman, Otello can finally take revenge on all who had been teasing him during the post-war period when he was a jobless man, but soon starts having trouble with his duties. Uncapable of directing the traffic properly at a rather busy crossing, he is moved to a peripheral area where his tasks are much easier and gets here the occasion he has always been waiting for: one day he is told by a man passing by that a car got stuck not far from there and that the car is no less than Sylva Koscina's . He hurries to the spot and makes friends with the actress, managing to invite her for a coffee at a near bar, and after repairing her car  asks Sylva to greet him on television at that night's broadcasting of the program Il Musichiere . Although the woman is missing her driving license and car documents, he lets her go, looking forward to the moment when she will make his name in front of 18 million viewers. At Il Musichiere, that night, Sylva greets Otello publicly and dedicates to him her performance of Adriano Celentano's Il tuo bacio è come un rock, but can't help saying whom Otello is and why she knows him, revealing also how he let her go when he should have fined or even arrested her. Otello is eventually called up by the Mayor and told how grave what he has done is, and that he is at risk of losing his job if he fails to fulfill his duties again: as a policeman, in fact, he must act according to law and make no distinctions. Some time after, Otello is in the workplace when a car passes by exceeding the 50 km/h speed limit in the area by 15 km/h. Driving the car is no less than the Mayor himself. Remembering what he had been told the day before and believing he is merely being tested by the Mayor, he gives him a speeding ticket and, as the Mayor drives away, follows him. He thus finds out the Mayor has a secret love story, despite being married. However, when he inspects the house where he thinks he will catch the man he is told by a woman  that he is wrong and that there is no Mayor in there. The day after, despite being advised by his superiors not to proceed and fine the Mayor, he does so, confident of being in the right, revealing also about the possible skeletons in the Mayor's closet. The Mayor decides therefore to punish Otello, who soon gets fired, and chooses to go on trial rather than paying the fine. The town is, however, close to elections, and the disappointed policeman, unemployed again, is made the candidate of the Monarchist National Party, which opposes the current Mayor and uses Otello's case as an evidence that the current government does not operate justly. Certain to have the whip hand, he threatens the Mayor, declaring he will cause his government to fall and get elected himself, to which the Mayor replies by showing Otello secret information about him that he and his party have collected. The information concerns his family, specifically his sister, who was thought to be a masseuse living in Milan and is instead a prostitute, his marriage, which is not a legal one for his wife's ex-husband is still alive, and his father, who shot the King during the war, an action that would be considered an outrage by the monarchists. Fearing for the consequences this information might cause if revealed to the public, Otello decides to finally give up, and on the next day's trial he admits, pretending, that he was wrong in fining the Mayor, a mistake that was caused by a broken Odometer, and that such a man as the Mayor himself can't but be always right. The final scene goes to show how common people are unable to compete with the powerful, and must, in the end, submit.

Nobody wants to play with him or to be his friend. Even the Grey Dogs avoid him. The Black Cat, a dodger and a faker, is the only one that feigns interest. Unexpectedly, the Pirate attacks the island and using the Black Cat, kidnaps the Blue Puppy. Along comes the Good Sailor, who always helps ones in trouble and does good things. As the Sailor sails the sea, the Black Cat tells him about the abduction of the Puppy. The Sailor decides to rescue the puppy and begins chasing the Pirate; the Pirate eventually attacks the Seaman with a saw-fish which sinks the Sailor's ship. The Pirate ties the Seaman and the Puppy together with shackles, but the Puppy manages to free both himself and the Sailor. Meanwhile, the Pirate and the Black Cat are celebrating their victory and sing a song about their spurious friendship. Their celebration is cut short, however, as the Seaman confronts and defeats the Pirate. He and the Puppy return to the island as heroes. Now, nobody tries to avoid the Puppy. More importantly, however, the Puppy now has a real friend. The moral of the story is that it is not so awful to be different from others, as long as one has friends, and the respect of one's peers.

Her best friend since college, Sylvie Fowler, is the editor of a prominent fashion magazine that dictates the latest in taste and style for New York City fashionistas. When Sylvie learns Steven is involved with Crystal Allen, a perfume salesgirl in Saks Fifth Avenue, from chatty manicurist Tanya, she confides in the ever-pregnant Edie Cohen but hesitates to tell Mary, who discovers the news herself from the same woman after getting a manicure herself. Despite her mother Catherine's exhortation to keep quiet about what she knows and a holiday away, Mary confronts Crystal first, in a department store, and then Steven, before asking for a divorce. Sylvie, Edie, and writer Alex Fisher join forces to support their spurned friend, but complications arise when Sylvie, facing the loss of her job, conspires with local gossip columnist Bailey Smith by confirming Mary's marital woes in exchange for Bailey contributing a celebrity profile to the magazine. Mary is stunned by Sylvie's betrayal and ends their friendship.

Mary is fired from her job by her father, has a makeover and decides to open her own clothing design firm with some financial assistance from Catherine. As she begins to get her life in order, she makes an effort to bond with Molly who reveals her father's relationship with Crystal is unraveling, and reunites with Sylvie who has quit her job.

Duca then goes to his long-time friend Isa's house, whom he secretly has feelings for, to tell her about the excitement. Soon after, his other friend Kid  arrives as well, and they explain the story to him as well. Duca sees Kid touch Isa's shoulder, though, and becomes jealous so he decides to return home. The following day, Duca talks with Isa  again, and his skill for detective work by spotting flaws in her story that she did not spend much time with Kid after Duca left; he does not mention this to her, though, and finds out the truth from Kid later while they are shopping for CDs. As the story develops, Duca continues to try to subtly keep Isa and Kid from getting together due to Isa's obvious attraction to Kid, while simultaneously looking into the murder. To this end, Duca asks permission to visit Eder in jail. Isa eagerly volunteers to go along on the adventure, and they set out the following day. When they meet Eder, he asks Duca to give a message to his lover. Eder asks Duca to tell her not to visit him while he is in jail, and to tell her that he is fine. On the way back, Isa remembers the Pokémon pen that was confiscated from her and they return to the jail to retrieve it. Since they took the bus through a dangerous part of town, they are forced to walk the distance. The two encounter a group of men who aggressively hit on Isa, causing her to run away. The next day at school, she brags about her adventure, embellishing the details greatly to her friends. Duca remains silent, but when pressed for details himself, he disagrees with Isa, and she storms away angrily. Attempting to get past the incident, he pretends it never happened, to the annoyance of Isa. Kid, however, is eager to have an adventure of his own and so agrees to travel to Eder's girlfriend's condo and relay the message. After locating Eder's Lover, Soraya , they are permitted up by the doorman. She answers her door scantily clad, and invites the boys in. They relay the message, to her general disinterest, and she requests that Duca repair her automatic pool cleaning device - a product of Eder's that failed to sell well. Out by her pool, Duca notices several items which lead him to believe another man is living with Soraya. Moving inside, his suspicions are confirmed when he sees a tattooed male arm answering a phone downstairs. While leaving, they accidentally track soil from a broken vase over the carpet downstairs to the fury of the doorman. They flee, giving Kid something to brag about at school the next day as well. Duca again visits his uncle, and this time asks him more questions. He decides that Eder is lying about his involvement and is covering for Soraya, who Duca believes is the true killer. Duca believes that his uncle is taking the fall for a woman who is being unfaithful to Eder and may be simply using Eder. He believes that Eder would never take Duca's word for it about the man living with Soraya, and so he goes about hiring a private investigator to obtain photographic evidence. Meanwhile, during the investigation, Duca is worried that an upcoming party will lead to Isa and Kid getting together at last, so he craftily plays matchmaker with Kid and another classmate. However, upon seeing how unhappy Isa becomes after watching the two dance, Duca helps to repair the situation and leaves the party with his two friends dancing closely together. When the investigator shows the photographs, Duca is surprised to find it showing Kid back at Soraya's condo. The series of pictures seems to suggest that the two had sex, and when Isa asks to see the photographs, Duca refuses to show them, causing yet another fight between the two friends. Duca mails the photographs to Eder, hoping it will convince him to tell the truth to the police, and he remains not on speaking terms with his two friends for nearly a week. Isa, hoping to make up, comes to his house and has lunch with Duca and his family. Eder shows up, having obtained Habeas corpus pending his trial. He has not yet opened the package containing the photographs Duca sent him, and becomes furious upon seeing them. He rushes from the house intent on killing both his girlfriend and her new lover. Isa also sees the pictures as well and is also crushed. Duca convinces her that they must go to Soraya's condo, though, to try to stop Eder from doing something foolish. Eder, meanwhile, attacks the man living with his girlfriend and discovers that it is Fabio, Soraya's brother. The man in the pictures, however, is Kid . Soraya explains the series of photographs with an innocent story; but Duca can see that she is lying. As usual, though, he does not mention it to anyone. Eder and his girlfriend make up, and Duca decides to keep Soraya's secret seeing Eder so happy. Isa and Kid also break up, though Kid tells Duca privately that he had misread the situation and never had sex with Soraya. Isa informs Duca that she and Kid broke up, to which Duca offers condolences. Isa asks him if that is really how he feels and Duca admits that he is happy they are no longer together. The film ends with the two friends kissing and Eder's fate still unknown.

It then cuts to the present, where a 17-year-old Lakota named Shane Chasing Horse is living on the Pine Ridge reservation. He is in trouble because he owes some money to a local gang -- money he used to buy a beautiful ring for Mae Little Wounded, a girl he likes. Meanwhile, his mother asks him to drive his grandfather, Pete Chasing Horse, a storyteller, down to the powwow. Shane is reluctant. However, when the gang comes after him, Shane changes his mind and heads out to the powwow with his grandfather, who agrees to give him his truck once they reach the powwow. Grandfather tells Shane the story of a young Lakota man who tries to win the hand of Bluebird Woman. He also tells the story of how a thunder spirit falls in love with a Mohawk woman and brings her up into the ethereal world of Sky Woman, and of how she raised their son back in her village until he was struck by one of the villagers and brought back to live with his father. Later, when a young redheaded man who is eager to learn about Native culture and hoping to be adopted by a Native American family asks to ride with them to the powwow, Shane says no. His grandfather then tells him the Kiowa story of Tehan, a white man who lived among the Kiowa and fought bravely alongside them, and Shane relents and lets the redhead ride with them. Shane’s grandfather then tells how Eagle Boy follows the advice of a shining spirit elk, and seeks out an old woman who can give him weapons with which to slay the mighty serpent Unceliga. He is repulsed when the ugly old woman embraces him, but reacts quite differently when she transforms into a beautiful younger woman. She reproaches him, but gives him what he needs. Eagle Boy slays Unceliga, whose heart instructs him and grants him great power and prophetic visions. Eventually, the gang members who are after Shane catch up with them, but accidentally drive their car off a cliff and into a lake while chasing him. Shane dives in and saves them, and his struggle is contrasted with Eagle Boy’s underwater battle with Unceliga. The gang members ride with them for a ways, until they and the redheaded hitchhiker leave them in order to travel with a group of attractive young women who are also headed to the powwow. As they travel, Shane’s grandfather tells Shane many other stories: several are about the trickster Coyote and Iktomi the spider. Another is about a young Pawnee man and his mother who are scorned by the rest of their tribe until the young man finds an unwanted dun pony who brings them good medicine. As Shane and his grandfather look up at the stars, the grandfather tells the story of the Quillwork Girl and her seven star brothers, which is about a Cheyenne girl who puts her faith in a dream and searches for seven brothers, but who must then contend with the Buffalo nation. The next story is about a young Chinook woman who sacrifices herself in order to cure her village of a terrible sickness, and the next is about a young Blackfoot hunter who cannot let go of the memory of his father. Shane and his grandfather continue their journey, losing their truck along the way and continuing on horseback and on foot. The two become closer. However, it then turns out that Shane’s grandfather has led them not to the powwow but to Shane’s father’s  trailer home. Shane is disgusted, but is persuaded to stay the night. The next morning Shane finally makes peace with his father. However, he then becomes grief-stricken when he discovers that his grandfather has died in his sleep. Shane decides to continue on to the powwow on horseback, and his father says that when Shane comes home he’ll be there too. The ending of Eagle Boy’s story is revealed: Eagle Boy decides that he wants to live like other men, and disobeys the heart by revealing it to the entire tribe . At the powwow, Shane takes on the role of a storyteller, and children gather around him.

Charlie and her circle are given special privileges by Edna and it is suggested that Charlie and Edna enjoy a more intimate relationship.

Only his first crush Gretchen ever treated him with kindness. But this all ended when he was goaded into performing a balancing act, whereupon a malicious prank backfired and Johnny ended up plunging down a dried up well to greet a rock floor. Since then he has been in Oakhurst State mental hospital for over a decade. Left semi-comatose, with only his now distorted memories and nightmarish flashbacks for comfort. One night the continual flood of harsh images is too much for his psyche, and he comes to finding himself badly disfigured and severely brain damaged , who will ever care for  Johnny now? No one, he  knows, which is why he suffers a complete psychotic break, and after venting his fury on a nurse, turns his rage towards those who left him this way. Bursting out of his temporary accommodation he storms off into the night, dead set on disposing of his old childhood tormentors, whose body parts he intends to offer up to the only person in his life who ever gave a damn about him - a certain girl called Gretchen!

However, as an illiterate, Inocencio has no idea of the contents of the letter. While waiting for the local druggist to wait on him so he can have the letter read to him, Inocencio is embarrassed to see that a customer's young daughter is already able to read while he, a grown man, cannot. He leaves without telling the druggist his problem, resolved to go to school and to wait to learn the letter's contents until he can read them for himself, so that never again will he have to share private matters with others because of his own ignorance. After registering at school, he stops by the local bank to ask for a job, having quit his previous employment that morning. Leaving the bank, he meets Blanca, an attractive young woman newly arrived in town, and shows her the way to her new place of employment, partly to avoid admitting he cannot read the written address. The daughter of Blanca's employer is entertaining her fiancé, Aníbal, who finds Blanca appealing and begins to make advances on her almost immediately. These advances are spurned each time; the final time, Aníbal warns her she will regret her refusals. Over the course of the film, Inocencio gradually learns to read, courts Blanca, and makes both friends and enemies at the bank. He foils a robbery and then a plot to make him look guilty; the bank manager is so pleased with his honesty that he gives Inocencio a 1000-peso reward, which the grateful man proceeds to spend on a new dress for his godmother, a traditional regional dress for Blanca to wear in a beauty contest, and new shoes for himself. While going about his cleaning work in the bank, Inocencio unwittingly drops the lawyer's letter &mdash; which he still has yet to read &mdash; and a fellow employee with a grudge against him finds the item on the floor. On the day of the contest, Aníbal and the bank employee conspire to make it appear that Blanca has stolen her employer's jewels and passed them to Inocencio. Though both are arrested, the trial is cut short when the bank employee discovers Aníbal has betrayed him and gone alone to claim the inheritance, leaving the employee to reveal the whole plot. Inocencio and his friends rush to Mexico City to thwart the attempt and denounce Aníbal, who is arrested at the lawyer's office after he arrives to claim the funds. The film concludes with Inocencio's and Blanca's wedding.

She is bright and beautiful. She is also rebellious as a consequence of her turbulent home life. She arms herself with sarcasm that barely disguises her hurt. Pushed aside by her mother, Karen , who is on her third marriage and counting, Greta is shipped off to her grandparents for the summer. She is not happy about it and neither are her grandparents. In fact, she tells them that she fully intends to kill herself before the summer is over and compiles a notebook of suicide methods. Greta's snarky ways result in her being offered a job as a waitress at a local seafood restaurant. While working there, her odd sense of humour makes her attractive to many customers. Greta falls for a charismatic short-order cook named Julie . When he reveals to her that he was once incarcerated in a juvenile correctional facility for stealing cars, Greta is even more attracted to him because of his ambitions. Jule tells her that his experience made him determined to do something positive with his life and he attempts to convince Greta to not give up on hers. He is alarmed when he sees Greta's'suicide list.' Although Greta's grandparents Katherine  and Joseph ([[Michael Murphy  are initially concerned about her boyfriend's criminal past, Julie proves himself worthy of their trust and demonstrates that he truly does care for Greta. Joseph shows Julie how much he does trust in him, by telling him about Greta's father, who had committed suicide in front of Greta when she was very young. Julie also showcases his respect for Greta when she attempts to lose her virginity to Julie. She does not succeed because he tells her he will not be one of the thing she checks off of her 'To Do List' and that it has to be another time. While the four are out sailing in Joseph's boat, Greta tries to drown herself. When Julie rescues her, the fright causes Katherine to have a mild heart attack. Katherine is given a positive prognosis by a doctor and she and her husband stay the night at the local hospital. Julie is mad at Greta, telling her that she should appreciate the life she has. The near catastrophe gives Greta a wake-up call and shows her how deeply her own actions impact those around her. Once Katherine gets back from the hospital, Greta is determined to show her how sorry she is, which she does by engaging in gardening duties. Katherine, however, is still furious at her, telling Greta she does not even know what she is sorry about. She and Greta have a heart to heart conversation, although they are interrupted by Greta's mother, Karen, and her current husband, who have come to take Greta to a summer boot camp. The Grandparents are schocked at Karen's abrasive behaviour. Greta runs away to talk to Julie who tells her that she is indeed, very messed up, but a boot camp will never help her if she doesn't want to help herself. Julie's advice calms Greta and she returns to the house to find her mother has already packed up her things. In a struggle to stay  and a struggle to leave , Joseph arrives and interrupts them all telling Karen that Greta does not need a bootcamp, she needs love, and that both Greta and Karen will be staying with them. The three women bond looking at old pictures and the film ends with Greta leaving her suicide notebook in the ocean and in a voice over  thanking her for letting her stay for the rest of the summer with her Grandparents.

Katherine is given a positive prognosis by a doctor and she and her husband stay the night at the local hospital. Julie is mad at Greta, telling her that she should appreciate the life she has. The near catastrophe gives Greta a wake-up call and shows her how deeply her own actions impact those around her. Once Katherine gets back from the hospital, Greta is determined to show her how sorry she is, which she does by engaging in gardening duties. Katherine, however, is still furious at her, telling Greta she does not even know what she is sorry about. She and Greta have a heart to heart conversation, although they are interrupted by Greta's mother, Karen, and her current husband, who have come to take Greta to a summer boot camp. The Grandparents are schocked at Karen's abrasive behaviour. Greta runs away to talk to Julie who tells her that she is indeed, very messed up, but a boot camp will never help her if she doesn't want to help herself. Julie's advice calms Greta and she returns to the house to find her mother has already packed up her things. In a struggle to stay  and a struggle to leave , Joseph arrives and interrupts them all telling Karen that Greta does not need a bootcamp, she needs love, and that both Greta and Karen will be staying with them. The three women bond looking at old pictures and the film ends with Greta leaving her suicide notebook in the ocean and in a voice over  thanking her for letting her stay for the rest of the summer with her Grandparents.

Forced to stay overnight in the town, Liz meets Sarah Austin , a reporter for a tabloid newspaper, who is in town to investigate legends of living scarecrows. The townspeople of Hope once sacrificed people by nailing them to crosses in the cornfields until a young girl alerted residents of the nearby town of Liberty. Horrified to learn of the murders going on in Hope, the townspeople of Liberty nailed the local preacher who spearheaded the sacrifices to a cross. Legend contends that one day he will be reborn. Sarah persuades Liz to accompany her to the cornfield. At the cornfield, Sarah takes photos of a scarecrow that she and Liz construct and hang on a cross, intending to use the photograph for the newspaper's front page. Sarah is later attacked and killed by the scarecrow, which comes to life. The scarecrow tries to kill Liz as well but she manages to escape in the squad car of a deputy, who is killed upon arriving at the scene. She drives to the sheriff's office, where she tells her tale. When the deputy is unable to reach anyone by radio or phone, he leaves Liz alone while he goes to find out the problem. Liz is able to fend off the scarecrow when it arrives, stalking her. She tries to flee in her car but sees that that the engine has been removed. She takes refuge with the town's preacher, but discovers that the preacher is the leader of the townspeople, who worship the spirit of the founding preacher. The preacher intends to bring the spirit back to life by fathering a child with Liz, whom the spirit can possess. The sheriff arrives in time to stop the townspeople, but loses consciousness in a car crash. When the clergyman tries to rape Liz, she fends him off and escapes. As she flees, she finds Sabrina , a child hiding in an underground shelter. Their parents were killed by the scarecrow, but they had escaped. Meanwhile, the townspeople set out in search of Liz. Liz hides Sabrina in a hole in the cornfield while she goes for help. She makes it to the next town only to find everyone dead. She is picked up by the sheriff, who escaped, and Liz tells him about Sabrina and jokes that the townspeople think she is a virgin. When they return to the cornfield, Liz discovers that the sheriff has been possessed by the spirit of the evil preacher. The preacher now goes in search of Sabrina as Liz is not pure. Sabrina sneaks into the farmhouse and sets it on fire. The townspeople let Liz and Sabrina escape while they burn the body of the preacher, as the prophecy tells them to. Liz flees with the child, but the spirit of the preacher possesses the body of Sabrina's father, who they encounter hanging on one of the crosses in the cornfield. Vines ensnare Liz as the animated corpse appeals to Sabrina. A murder of crows appear and the townspeople believe it is a good omen, until the crows attack and kill them, as well as attacking Sabrina's father, allowing Liz to extract herself from the vines. Liz and Sabrina escape, hitching a ride from a truck driver who is passing through the area. He turns on the radio, and a song comes on that reminds Liz and Sabrine of their ordeal. Liz turns the radio off, and they continue down the road, leaving Hope behind."

They reach the mansion and the uncle plays a series of tricks to make the house appear haunted. A series of people appear in white sheets and covered in flour until the prank is uncovered. In a more unusual prank a pair of trousers walk on their own, having a little black boy inside. We see Harold's hair stand on end then fall.

At the same time easy-going carpenter Jack Fuller  is fired from his job by his father, Jack, Sr. . Both become emotionally distraught and, with best friends Toni ""Tipper"" , a bartender, and Jeff ""Hater"" , a lawyer, take a debauched trip to Las Vegas. Joy and Jack meet by chance when they are given the same hotel room because of a computer error. After clearing up the misunderstanding and receiving upgraded rooms and coupons to various clubs, they party and drink together and end up getting married. The next morning, they realize it was a mistake and decide to divorce. Before they do so, Jack uses a quarter Joy gives him in a slot machine. He hits a three million dollar jackpot and Joy reminds Jack that they are married and hence, she is entitled to half of the money. The couple return to New York, where they attempt to divorce. Their judge  declares that the couple cannot divorce until they attempt to co-exist for six months, while attending weekly sessions with a marriage counselor . If they work at the marriage but still want to divorce after six months, each will be permitted to keep half the winnings. If either party does not cooperate, the money will be tied up in litigation by the judge. The newlyweds devise more and more cunning schemes to undermine each other, such as Jack telling Joy that their counseling session is canceled to prove she's not committed, and Joy inviting girls to their apartment to try to get Jack to cheat on her. Jack gives Joy's ex-fiancé Mason , her engagement ring back without Joy knowing. At Joy's job retreat, Jack and Joy ironically find themselves developing an unexpected attraction to one another and they soon realize that being with each other has brought out the best in both of them.{{cite web}}. After they get back from the retreat, it's time for the judge to decide what happens to the money. On her way to the hearing, Joy sees her ex-fiancé Mason and he tells her that he wants her back. He gives her back the engagement ring and tells her that she is good enough for him. Joy realizes that Jack set her up to get back with him, therefore cheating on him and letting Jack keep the money. Joy walks away from Mason and goes to the hearing. At the hearing, their marriage counselor testifies that the couple truly tried to work on their marriage. The judge decides that they will split the remaining 1.4 million dollars . Joy tells the judge she doesn't want any money, and gives the engagement ring to Jack, telling him she officially doesn't want anything from him. Jack realizes she knows that he talked to Mason. Joy gets the promotion she'd been working for, but tells her boss that she would rather be happy doing nothing than doing something she hated and being miserable. The next scene is of Jack talking to his parents, and them telling him that it looked like he and Joy were actually in love. Realizing his mistake, he goes to her friend Tipper to find out where she is. Tipper tells Jack that she quit her job – a fact she seems quite disgruntled by – and that nobody knows where she is. He has a suspicion that she has gone to a beach  that she told him about, the only place that makes her feel truly happy. Jack asks her to be his wife  and she says yes. As the two embrace, Joy says that she quit her job and has no idea what she's going to do. Jack reminds her that they have a lot of money between them. Joy states that they hit the jackpot, to which Jack replies that he certainly did . In the credits it shows a clip of what happened between Tipper and Hater the day Jack and Joy got married. It also shows Tipper and Hater subsequently enacting a plan of revenge on Mason, devised by Tipper earlier in the film. Tipper and Hater ring Mason's doorbell, and when he answers, Tipper slugs him in his testicles. He moans in agony and drops to his knees asking why, and she responds that he knows why, and Tipper leaves with Hater. In a post-credits scene, Dave is telling Hater about a party that evening, but Hater no longer wants to associate with Dave, citing Jack as being ""the glue"" that held the two of them together as friends. With that, Hater simply leaves. The movie ends with Dave randomly asking a random guy on the street if he likes to party."

These top executives seem more content with chanting Indian style noises rather than listen to how they can make money through sound investments. When Evan finally discovers that his daughter, Olivia , is somehow able to tell the future within the financial world by using her 'goo-gaa' comfort blanket and her imaginary friends , he discovers he has an invaluable upper hand now at the office. In order for Evan to ask these imaginary friends any question he must travel through the imaginary world, through a dense forest, past a dragon, through caves, and even walk through France. Before, Evan who is a part-time father really had no time for his daughter, now is forced to play with her and by her rules. After only a couple of days with her, he rediscovers the inner child within himself and genuinely has a lot of fun playing these imaginary games with Olivia.

Much of his opening commentary is done as he is walking or lying on a busy sidewalk, with people walking on him and providing an occasional kick, one of which sends him to the front of the Moonbeam Rocket Company  as he declares that he wants to go to the moon. In the showroom of Moonbeam Rocket Company are rockets to Mars, Venus, Palm Springs , and a ""Moon Special,"" which the cat enters. He pushes the start button , and the flight begins as buildings duck out of the way, ""no vacancy"" signs appear on planets as he passes them, and a succession of space-related sight gags ensue. Stars move out of the way of the rocket, which subsequently punches a hole in the Big Dipper before the Little Dipper moves to catch the leakage; the rocket then bounces pinball-style from star to star  until it registers ""Tilt"" upon lunar impact. After the crash, the cat revels in his newfound solitude, but the silence was only momentary as he discovers his new neighbors: *A bicycle horn tooting itself *A steam whistle blowing *Disembodied mouth and hands repeatedly saying ""Mammy, Mammy, Mammy"" in the style of Al Jolson *A self-playing accordion *A yo-yo going up and down with the sound of a slide whistle *A manual fire engine siren operating itself *A tire repeatedly having blowouts by running over nails *A claw hammer chasing a nail, then pounding the cat into the group before pulling him out *A tube of lipstick chasing a pair of giggling lips  *A hand and scissors chasing a piece of paper  *An invisible dog chasing a fire hydrant *A diaper, a safety pin, and a bottle of baby powder  *A daisy-like flower running away from a shovel  *A pencil chased by a pencil sharpener, which subsequently sharpens the cat's tail  The cat realizes that his original home was much preferable to his new surroundings; he pulls down a golf course backdrop, places himself on a tee and sends himself back to Earth with one swing of the golf club. He returns to ""The good ol' U.S. of A."" (on the corner of 45th Street and [[Broadway  and expresses his newfound appreciation of his home and the people who continue to walk over him."

Ali's son Nejat , a professor of German literature, does not have time to respond to the prospect of living with a woman of ""easy virtue"" before Ali is stricken with a heart attack. He softens to her: he learns that she sends shoes to Turkey for her 27-year-old daughter and wishes that her daughter receive an education like his. Back home from the hospital, Ali suspects that the other two may have become lovers. When his drunken demands of Yeter make her threaten to leave, he strikes her and she dies from the blow. Ali is sent to prison. Nejat travels to Istanbul to search for Yeter's daughter, Ayten , and assume responsibility for her education.

A hooded figure scoops it up and is pursued on foot by a battalion of uniformed officers, barely managing to hide the contraband on a random rooftop. This is Ayten, a member of a Turkish Communist resistance group. When her cell is raided, she flees Turkey and takes up a new identity with political allies in Bremen, Germany. However, even there, she has a falling out when she is unable to pay her debts, and thus finds herself on the street with barely a euro to her name. Her mother's number is lost, so she lives illegally and searches for her in local shoe shops. Lotte, a university student, offers to help her with food, clothes, and a place to stay—a gesture which is not particularly welcomed by her mother, Susanne. Ayten and Lotte become lovers and Lotte decides to help Ayten search for her mother. The quest is cut short when a traffic stop exposes Ayten's illegal status and she attempts a claim of political asylum. Despite Susanne's financial support, Germany rules that Ayten has no legitimate fear of political persecution. She's deported and immediately imprisoned. Lotte is devastated. She travels to Turkey to try to free Ayten, but quickly realizes how little hope there is, as she is facing 15 to 20 years in jail. Susanne pleads with her to think of her future and return home. When Lotte refuses, her mother refuses to assist her further. Lotte gravitates to Nejat's bookstore and ends up renting a spare room from him. Finally granted a prison visit with Ayten, Lotte follows her imprisoned lover's request and retrieves the handgun Ayten grabbed in the riot. But Lotte's bag, with the gun inside, is snatched by a crew of boys that she then chases through their neighborhood. When finally she finds them in a vacant lot, one of them is inspecting the gun. She demands he return it, but he points it at her and fires, killing her instantly. ;The Edge of Heaven  Upon his release, Ali is deported to Turkey, returning to his property in Trabzon on the Black Sea coast. After her daughter's death, Susanne goes to Istanbul to see where her daughter had been living the past few months. She meets Nejat and reads her daughter's diary; she decides to take on her daughter's mission of freeing Ayten from prison. Susanne's visit to Ayten—an offer of forgiveness and support—leads the younger woman to exercise her right of repentance. As a result, she wins her freedom. Susanne asks Nejat about the story behind a Bayram they notice, learning that it commemorates Ibrahim's sacrifice of his son Ishmael. She comments that there is the same story in the Bible, where Abraham is asked to sacrifice his son Isaac. Nejat reminisces about being scared by the story as a child and asking his father if he would sacrifice him if God told him to. When asked by Susanne what his father's answer was, Nejat tells her that his father said ""He would make God his enemy in order to protect me"". Nejat removes the poster of Yeter from the shop's noticeboard. He asks Susanne to look after his shop while he is gone, and drives to Trabzon where his father is living. Susanne offers Ayten a place to stay with her at Nejat's house. When Nejat arrives in Trabzon, his father is out fishing, so he waits for him on the beach."

José is a man romantically possessed and obsessed by his childhood in Granada during the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in the spring of 1936. Now in his fifties, José returns to Granada and relives his childhood there. A time when he fell in love with Garcia Lorca and had a youthful affair with one of Lorca's own lovers. Memories come flooding back to the mature José, of youthful sexual conquest, of Lorca's murder at the hands of Franco's agents, and his own early homosexual affairs. José's entire life is colored by his obsessions with Garcia Lorca, his unknown God, to whom the film is dedicated. José travels twice to Granada. First, he revisits a woman who is also obsessed with Garcia Lorca's memory, and steals a photograph of the boy with whom he had his first sexual encounter; later, José returns to Madrid, to a party in search of his youth, and meets a pianist with whom he had sexual relations many years before but now does not remember. When José returns to Madrid, he is a man tormented by his past, and in search of peace. Listening to a taped recording of Garcia Lorca's famous ""Ode to Walt Whitman"", he desires nothing more than to face the rest of his life in loneliness, although his recent lover, Miguel has returned to his bed and wants to continue their affair. José realizes that he is really all alone in their world, alone with his God."

He loves ice hockey but lives for his girlfriend, Jenny Walker. Late one night while driving home from a painful loss on the ice, Ian comes across a bewildering discovery; what looks like a dead body near the railroad tracks. Investigating the grisly discovery, Ian is attacked by the ""corpse"", forced onto the tracks and subsequently barreled over by an oncoming train. He wakes up in an office cubicle. He's still alive, but older and shacked up with a beautiful, but eerily mysterious woman by the name of Medea. Jenny is still there, but she's not his girlfriend, just a co-worker and one of a number of apparently familiar faces. Ian meets a strange old man who implies he is in danger. From this old man he learns that he is being hunted by the Harvesters; a group of mind-controlling vampire-like characters who cannot be killed and feed off human fear. He explains that everyday, at different times and different places, the clocks stop and they come after him to kill him. The only problem is that Ian won't stay dead. He wakes in a new life, a new place, only for the cycle to repeat itself. Suddenly one of the Harvesters attacks the old man and Ian runs. They chase Ian mercilessly, all the way back to his apartment where Medea, who is clearly one of them, is waiting. Once again, Ian is killed. He wakes to find he's a junkie in a rundown apartment, with Jenny living a few doors down. He implores her to remember him, desperately reaching out and searching for someone to help him make sense of what's going on. When the Harvesters come again Jenny and Ian have no choice but to run. As they seek refuge on a subway train heading out-of-town, Jenny confesses to her memories of Ian's former lives. Later on, the old man meets Ian in the train again while Jenny sleeps. It is then that the old man reveals that he is one of the Harvesters, and hints at Ian's involvement with them. When they disembark they are again confronted by a group of Harvesters, a seething mass of pulsating veins, pitch-black muscles and midnight flesh. We recognize some of the barely human faces from Ian's previous lives including Medea who reveals a shocking truth: That Ian was one of these monsters until he rebelled against the colony and managed to kill one other Harvester, and Medea used to be his ""mate"". Medea tries to force Ian to feed again with fear and pain and return back to the ""fold"", but Ian decides against this. Medea and the Harvesters attack once more, and she explains that his rebellion came after his first encounter with Jenny. So moved was he by the girl, that he wished to live a mortal life with her. Before Medea can harm Jenny, however, a final change comes over Ian with the help of Gray, the Harvester who had helped him before. Apparently Ian found a sustenance that was far superior to fear or pain, and so did the old man: Love. Making this connection to a human being changes the specific nature of a Harvester, which allowed the old man  to kill the members of their kind. Gray had beseeched Ian to protect Jenny out of experience; having lost his love to the Harvesters, he could only feed on fear once again and spent what remained of his life slowly starving himself while trying to find love another time. Imploring Ian to feed off him and tap into those emotions of affection and kinship, Gray passes while restoring Ian. In doing so, Ian regains his true power: His Harvester-self is finally born out of his human flesh, uniquely exuding goodness rather than malevolence. He now has the capacity to turn the tables on these creatures and to feed on their fear and to give life. He then goes after Jenny, who is being actively stalked by his former clan. After saving Jenny, Ian creates a new life for them, with Ian as a successful professional hockey player with Jenny at his side. While Jenny has no recollection of their harrowing adventure, Ian, having realized his abilities, will begin to take the fight to the Harvesters."

István does not want to believe the allegations and succumbs once more to the countess. Only when he and one of his companions discovers evidence of her crime he can arrest the Countess. During the trial, Erzsébet is found guilty and due to her noble origin, she is convicted to spend the rest of her life walled into her room in castle Čachtice, in total isolation. Her staff is also found guilty and executed. All her property were awarded to the Count Thurzó, with the exception of Čachtice that is given to her children. Driven by desperation, Erzsébet Báthory kills herself, after being walled in, and is then buried without a coffin and funeral ceremony in a humble grave. One is led to doubt the sentence, and it remains unsure how much of the happenings have been manipulated by Istvan's father.

What is homelessness? Today in all societies the problem of homelessness can be observed. In modern countries like Britain, homeless people can be seen in big cities such as London. Despite the British government’s efforts to tackle this problem, there are about 250,000 homeless people in this country. This documentary film is emphasizing from one side, on the homelessness as an odd element in the modern society, and from another side to the homeless person himself, who represents the sufferings of mankind of our time. Many reasons contribute to becoming homeless, these include unavailability of employment opportunities, which becomes a vicious circle due to the initial problem of being homeless, domestic violence, poverty, caused by many factors including unemployment and underemployment. Increased wealth disparity and income inequality causes distortions in the housing market that push rent burdens higher, making housing unaffordable. This documentary film analyses many of these issues and problems.

Sunny Chopra  is a 28-year-old writer who has carved a name for himself as a popular agony uncle, named Gyan Guru, writing for the Times of Hindustan. Sunny also managed to bag a prestigious screenplay writing project for the most happening film director, Karan Johar. A bit of a cynic, he believes he is a self-made man and that whatever he has achieved in life is due to his own hard work and nobody else's. His cynicism is extended to his views about marriage to his fiancée Jenny  and to the festival of Diwali too. Just as Sunny is cynical about life, Michael Burnett  is optimistic about it. 51-year-old Michael is a simple-minded man, almost childlike and has recently landed job as a pizza delivery boy at Mummy's Pizza. Michael has sort of an inclination to lose every job he has ever had in two days flat. This time, however, he vows to keep this one no matter what. On the eve of Diwali, Sunny has loads of stuff to do and very little time to do it. He has to meet his screenplay deadline, he has to get rid of Pandey , his irritatingly intrusive next door neighbor, and he's got to avoid his editor's telephone calls who is livid that he's bunking work. But more importantly he needs to get Jenny out of the way because he has a date with Maya , a South Indian superstar who he has been in love with since as long as he can remember. In this confusion, Sunny forgets that there is no food in his bachelor pad and orders a pizza that Michael is given the task of delivering. And what Michael delivers to Sunny is so much more than just a pizza. Sunny is home delivered life's simple lessons – right to his doorstep.

Wang Yao , a thirty-four-year-old cook is despondent when his blind date, Li Chuan , is seriously injured in a natural gas explosion. Meanwhile, a fellow subway passenger, a health food saleswoman  who hawks her goods every day on the same subway car, discovers her boyfriend has been cheating on her and has decided to leave her. The unlikely pair of the cook and the saleswoman eventually find love and become engaged to be married. Another relationship also begins in the subway between Da Ming , a young man, and a photo-development salesgirl, Tian Ai . The man, painfully shy, takes pictures of himself with a note asking to meet the girl, but he flees at the last moment. When Tian Ai finally finds and confronts him, he is too ashamed to speak, but manages to communicate to her his cell phone number as the train pulls away. As for Jianbin, his life seems to spiral more out of control. Unable to pay the rent, and quickly running out of money, he also becomes aware that his wife may be having an affair, though Xiaohui keeps her relationship with Lao Hu strictly platonic. Jianbin, however, tells his wife that his ""work"" has decided to send him to France for training, and he begins to contemplate leaving Xiaohui while he visits the blinded schoolteacher after learning about her from Wang Yao. Pretending to be the cook, the two begin a close friendship. After Jianbin decides to confront Lao Hu in a scene where he lights the latter man's newspaper on fire, Jianbin and Xiaohui's relationship seems to be on the brink of self-destruction, as neither is willing to reveal the truth about themselves. Xiaohui, however, finally learns that Jianbin has lost his job and has been riding the subway for the past six months from Wang Yao, just as Jianbin leaves for his ""trip."" Instead of heading to the airport, Jianbin heads to the hospital to see Li Chuan's bandages to come off. But he leaves before she can see him, as Jianbin realizes that he still loves his wife. Xiaohui and Jianbin then meet in the same subway station where they first arrived in Beijing seven years ago as the film ends."

He describes a series of murders that had plagued the world-famous Las Vegas Strip. All of the victims had their blood drained, and Kolchak comes to suspect that the killer believes himself to be a vampire, much to the chagrin of his cantankerous boss Anthony  Vincenzo, portrayed by actor Simon Oakland. Kolchak also has a girlfriend named Gail Foster  who earns her living as a dancer. During the movie, Kolchak attempts to get her to give up her night job, though he does not offer her a proposal of marriage, or other commitment. At the urging of this girlfriend, Kolchak begins to look into vampire lore, but is skeptical. Inexplicable events lead Kolchak to begin to believe that something supernatural is occurring, and the evidence of his own eyes eventually persuades him that this is in fact a real vampire. Kolchak is able to convince the police that they are fighting a vampire, but it is he who ultimately takes the vampire down and unlike subsequent productions, he does so with the help of his friend in the FBI . In the end, Kolchak relates that his deal with the police for an exclusive was not honored. Kolchak finds himself out of a job once again, and blackmailed by the Las Vegas police never to return to Las Vegas. Kolchak is told that his girlfriend Gail has also been ""asked to leave town"" for engaging in unsavory activities. Carl exhausts his savings placing personal advertisements across the country in an attempt to find her but is unsuccessful."

One night when she is attending two weddings almost simultaneously, she meets Kevin Doyle , who helps her home but disgusts her with his cynical views of marriage. He finds her day planner which she'd forgotten in the cab they shared. Meanwhile, Jane's sister Tess  falls in love with Jane's boss George . Tess pretends to like the same things that George does so that she can get him to like her. Despite loving George herself, Jane does not reveal the truth and the courtship progresses rapidly. Soon the new couple announce that they intend to marry in only three weeks. The reporter who agrees to cover their wedding for the society page turns out to be Kevin, who writes wedding announcements under a pseudonym. Having looked at the contents of Jane's planner before returning it, he then decides to use the contents as material for a piece on the ""perennial bridesmaid"" and hopefully be promoted to writing investigative pieces about ""real"" news. Jane is unaware of Kevin's intentions, and when he asks to interview her for his column on Tess, gets her to try on all 27 bridesmaids dresses in her closet. He takes pictures of her in all of them and sends them with the completed article to his boss. As they get to know each other because of Tess's wedding, Kevin begins to think that Jane is not as one-dimensional as he thought, and asks his editor to hold his article so he can ""fix"" it. His editor runs the article anyway on the front page of the Commitments section, and Jane is furious at him. Tess then gets angry at Jane for giving Kevin material about her, whom he describes as a bridezilla. The fight escalates when Jane realizes that Tess destroyed their late mother's wedding dress to make her own gown. Despite the fight, Tess still asks Jane to make a slideshow to show at her engagement party. Jane decides that George should know the truth about Tess and instead runs pictures of Tess with other men, eating ribs, and holding a cat by the tail - in short, doing all the things she had told George that she never did. After Pedro, the young Hispanic child that George mentors, tells the crowd that Tess had him cleaning George's apartment for money, George breaks off the engagement. Later at work, George tells Jane that he appreciates her because she never says no. Remembering that Kevin once said the same thing as a criticism, Jane quits and admits she only stayed at the job because she was in love with George. She discovers after an experimental kiss that she no longer loves him and decides to meet Kevin. She announces in front of the entire crowd at a wedding that he is covering that she is in love with him. One year later at Jane and Kevin's wedding, George and Tess meet again. All 27 brides she helped, as well as Tess and Casey, her best friend, are her bridesmaids."

The reporter who agrees to cover their wedding for the society page turns out to be Kevin, who writes wedding announcements under a pseudonym. Having looked at the contents of Jane's planner before returning it, he then decides to use the contents as material for a piece on the ""perennial bridesmaid"" and hopefully be promoted to writing investigative pieces about ""real"" news. Jane is unaware of Kevin's intentions, and when he asks to interview her for his column on Tess, gets her to try on all 27 bridesmaids dresses in her closet. He takes pictures of her in all of them and sends them with the completed article to his boss. As they get to know each other because of Tess's wedding, Kevin begins to think that Jane is not as one-dimensional as he thought, and asks his editor to hold his article so he can ""fix"" it. His editor runs the article anyway on the front page of the Commitments section, and Jane is furious at him. Tess then gets angry at Jane for giving Kevin material about her, whom he describes as a bridezilla. The fight escalates when Jane realizes that Tess destroyed their late mother's wedding dress to make her own gown. Despite the fight, Tess still asks Jane to make a slideshow to show at her engagement party. Jane decides that George should know the truth about Tess and instead runs pictures of Tess with other men, eating ribs, and holding a cat by the tail - in short, doing all the things she had told George that she never did. After Pedro, the young Hispanic child that George mentors, tells the crowd that Tess had him cleaning George's apartment for money, George breaks off the engagement. Later at work, George tells Jane that he appreciates her because she never says no. Remembering that Kevin once said the same thing as a criticism, Jane quits and admits she only stayed at the job because she was in love with George. She discovers after an experimental kiss that she no longer loves him and decides to meet Kevin. She announces in front of the entire crowd at a wedding that he is covering that she is in love with him. One year later at Jane and Kevin's wedding, George and Tess meet again. All 27 brides she helped, as well as Tess and Casey, her best friend, are her bridesmaids."

Maek is ordered to kill Iht, but because he only kills scum and has discovered that Iht isn't bad, he refuses, turning the gun on the enforcers who had hired him to murder Iht. A gun battle ensues during which Maek is wounded, but Iht grabs Maek's gun and shoots their way out of the mobsters' headquarters. The two men then escape on Maek's motorcycle. Maek tells Iht to leave at gun point but he won't and takes Maek back to his rooftop hide-out. There, over a period of time, Iht tends to Maek's wound and finds himself attracted to him. In fact, Maek is also attracted to Iht, but keeps it hidden, while Iht cares for his former would-be killer with great tenderness. While giving Maek a bath one day, Iht kisses him on the mouth. Maek reciprocates and the two men engage in a passionate sexual experience. The next day, however, a conflicted Maek demands that Iht go away and leave him alone. Iht returns home to his fiancee, Sai, but is no longer interested in continuing a relationship with her. Iht spends his days pining over Maek, and tracks down Maek's brother, Mhok, and their mother. Mhok is HIV positive, as the result of sexual abuse by his and Maek's stepfather, and their mother is dying of AIDS. Maek remains elusive, hiding from Iht when he visits the hideout, but leaving signs that he's there so Iht will return. Though Maek avoids making contact with Iht, eventually he goes to visit his mother and brother, and Iht corners him at the entrance to the building, declaring his love for Maek and stressing how much he misses him. They kiss passionately. They are unfortunately covertly observed by Sai, Iht's live-in fiancee. Maek's dream is to take his mother and brother away from Bangkok to the mountains of Mae Hong Son Province. But after Maek's mother overhears that Mhok has prostituted himself to survive after contracting AIDS from his stepfather, she commits suicide by hanging herself. The brothers take her down, and as they are rushing her from the apartment, she is killed by a gunshot fired by an unseen sniper. The bullet is presumably intended for Maek. Maek's former mobster employers are gunning for him and Iht. Maek decides to hunt them down first, and he succeeds in killing them. After Mohk informs Iht what Maek is doing, Iht goes to the capo's house to try to stop Maek, but he is too late and misses Maek by a second. Iht is injured when the capo's wife shoots at a clock that shatters in Iht's face. Maek, meanwhile meets his brother at the railway station to leave Bangkok for good. But before he can board the train, he is apprehended by the police and taken away. Mhok breaks down. He's the sole witness to his brother being apprehended. Years pass by. Iht visits Maek in prison and reveals that he was left blind in the final gunbattle with Maek's ex-boss.

Bugs asks ""What ya got in the bag, doc?"", prompting Wile E. Coyote's long-winded explanation about how he is a genius. The bunny replaces himself with dynamite, and it isn't long before Wile E. Coyote is the victim of a pair of explosions, the second coming when he runs to the elevator. The determined coyote then builds his latest contraption: A do-it-yourself UNIVAC Electronic Brain, which he consults for suggestions in capturing Bugs. The machine provides the recommendations after Wile E. supplies key words. Wile E. Coyote's efforts include the following: * ""Rabbit,"" ""in hole,"" and ""combination lock.""

Coyote is looking for, as the live stick is vacuumed up. However, Wile E. Coyote doesn't count on Bugs Bunny emptying the vacuum bag into a garbage can that he is hiding in. * ""Well, how about trying a booby trap in the carrot patch?"" Wile E. Coyote places a boulder above Bugs Bunny's carrot patch. Bugs, wearing a bonnet and bow tie, nonchalantly singing  harvests the carrot meant to trigger the trap, without setting off the trap. However, when Wile E. Coyote pulls at the trap, it is triggered. A panicked Wile E. Coyote desperately asks the UNIVAC, ""Rock,"" ""falling."" ""What'll,""I,"" ""do?"" The answer provides no solace: ""Go back and take your medicine."" Wile E. goes back and is flattened by the boulder, once and for all. The UNIVAC's intelligence is then revealed to be Bugs Bunny when the computer screen slides open. Bugs then quotes: ""Of course the real beauty of this machine is that it has only one moving part."""

Hoping to escape Paris but needing cash, Alex, Tom, Farid, the pregnant Yasmine, and her brother Sami take advantage of the chaos to pull off a robbery. Sami is shot and the group splits up: Alex and Yasmine take Sami to a hospital, and Tom and Farid take the money to a family-run inn near the border. Innkeepers Gilberte and Klaudia claim their rooms are free and seduce the two men. At the hospital, the emergency room staff report Sami's injury to the police. Sami insists Yasmine run before the police catch her. His dying wish is that Yasmine not have an abortion. Alex and Yasmine flee, phoning their friends for directions to the inn. Tom and Farid give them directions but soon after are brutally attacked by Gilberte, Klaudia, and Goetz. When Tom and Farid try to escape, Goetz runs their car off a cliff. The injured men wander into a mine shaft, where Tom is quickly recaptured. Farid must fend for himself in the mine with the family's rejected children. Unaware of the danger, Alex and Yasmine arrive at the inn and are captured by the family. Alex and Yasmine are chained in a muddy floored pig pen. Alex breaks Yasmine's chains and allows her to escape. When the captors discover Yasmine's escape, the father of the family, von Geisler, cut Alex's achilles tendons. Meanwhile in the mine, Farid finds the storage area for the victims. The family realizes something is amiss in the mine, and Hans chases Farid into a boiler where Farid is cooked alive. Yasmine flees from the inn but is quickly picked back up by Goetz. Back in the pig pen, von Geisler personally grants Alex's last wish, which is to be put down quickly. Initially, von Geisler wishes for Karl to ""wed"" Yasmine to carry on the family lineage, but when von Geisler learns she is already pregnant, he entrusts her to the meek Eva. Eva tells Yasmine that she came to the family in a very similar manner and that she is obedient because the family promised her that her parents would return for her some day. Eva also tells Yasmine of the rejected children she and Hans care for in the mine. Eventually, Eva leads Yasmine down to dinner, where the family awaits her.

In a voiceover, he expresses his disgust over the ramshackle, broken down state of things, and, with trepidation, recalls ""the summer I unwillingly grew up."" That summer kicked off with the arrival of Eli , as witnessed by preteen Philip  and best friend Jackson . The two boys stare in awe as Eli tumbles out of his ancient-looking car and invite the townsfolk over to look at his amazing model circus. It's not long before Eli convinces the mayor to pay him to create a scale model of the town for the upcoming bisesquicentennial. Philip and Jackson, both dealing with troubles at home, glom onto Eli, using his old camera to take pictures of the town for Eli to use as inspiration. Despite its picture-perfect surface, Philip's town is anything but idyllic. His father is a minister, but not exactly the heroic kind—more the philandering kind. Jackson's blind father drinks his life away, mourning the loss of Jackson's mother to a car crash. Both boys are lost in a sea of adult emotions, with neither the maturity nor the resources to cope. As the boys take pictures for Eli, they watch the lives of those they love unraveling around them, and struggle to hang onto their dream of an uncomplicated life where the sun is always high and the river is filled with fish..."

He is accompanied by his sikh mafia associates, Julie , Mika , Pankaj Udaas , Raftaar , Dilbaugh Singh  and Guruji Gurbaksh Singh . In a small village in Punjab, the birthplace of Lucky, lives another Sikh man more notorious than Lucky himself—Happy Singh . Happy has caused many problems and disastrous situations in the village, and the villagers are fed up with him. They decide to send Happy on a long trip to Australia with his friend Rangeela  to bring Lucky back to Punjab, which will keep Happy out of the village for some time and bring peace to the village. But at the airport, Happy's and Rangeela's tickets to Australia are accidentally exchanged with that of a man named Puneet  who was hoping to use them to fly to Egypt. In Egypt, Happy helps Sonia  and falls deeply in love with her. But he does not express his love to her. Leaving her behind, he heads to Australia to meet Lucky. Lucky refuses to return to his hometown and throws Happy and Rangeela out of his house. Penniless, Happy finds warmth and affection in an elderly sikh lady  who provides him with food in spite of being a stranger. Lucky winds up in hospital, paralyzed, after a series of violent incidents that Happy causes.  Happy unexpectedly receives the title of Kinng—thereby becoming the other ""Singh Is Kinng"" of the film's title. Alas, Happy is not proud of his rank and is kind-hearted. The lady who helped Happy is really worried and depressed as her daughter is returning from Egypt with her wealthy boyfriend, Puneet. The daughter does not know that after the death of her father years ago, her mother became poverty-stricken and was reduced to work as a flower seller. Happy gives the flower-seller Lucky's spacious house and makes all his mafia associates work under her. The lady's daughter arrives—and to Happy's horror, she is none other than Sonia. Happy, heart-broken, is forced to make a show of happiness to Sonia. Puneet says that he too would have had a good time with Happy and Sonia in Egypt had his ticket to Egypt not been exchanged in the airport, because of which he had ended up in Australia. Puneet had always been jealous of Sonia being with Happy. However, he doubts anything is going on between them. He and Sonia squabble about this topic; it is Happy who handles it. Meanwhile, after spending so much time with the kindhearted Happy, most of Lucky's gang members find themselves reformed and decide to become good. In spite of herself, Sonia falls in love with Happy—and the truth becomes difficult to hide. Sonia becomes aware of her poverty. Puneet sets his heart to marry Sonia. Sonia gets trapped in an emotional tug-of-war between Puneet, who loves her, and Happy, whom she loves. Puneet meets Mika, who is also the brother of the Kinng, and who agrees to kill Happy. Puneet's motives to kill Happy, however, differ from Mika's: Puneet wants to kill Happy to keep Sonia away from him, whereas Mika wants to kill Happy to make himself Kinng. The wedding day dawns and there is firing . Puneet hides while the pandit chants the mantras, his head totally covered by a pot, amidst gunfire all around. Meanwhile Happy takes Sonia's hand in order to save her and unknowingly both run around the fire seven times essentially getting married.  Suddenly, Mika turns up on the spot, ready to kill Happy, armed with a gang and his new special glasses and hearing aid. As he is about to shoot, Lucky steps up and stops him. Then a dialogue ensues between Mika, Happy, Lucky and the associates of the kinng . Then Happy tells him that being the ""king"" is no great thing and explains him the characteristics of a true Sikh. Lucky confesses that he always found sadness being Kinng, because a true king does not fight for himself, but for others. Overcome with remorse, Mika drops his revolver. The movie ends happily, with Happy and Sonia's marriage."

Will is forbidden to watch films or television and is made to leave his classroom when the teacher puts on a documentary. In the corridor, he meets Lee Carter , the worst-behaved boy in school, thrown out of another class for bad behaviour. They accidentally break a fish bowl in the corridor; Lee volunteers to take the blame, pretending that the punishment is torture, in exchange for Will's watch, which belonged to his dead father. Moreover Lee demands that Will performs the stunts in a film Lee is making with home video equipment owned by his bullying older brother, Lawrence , which Lawrence uses in his video pirating enterprise. He intends to enter the Screen Test Young Film-Makers' Competition. Will accepts, after accidentally seeing the film First Blood at Lee's house while hiding from Lawrence. He becomes very enthusiastic, and plays several dangerous action scenes, culminating in the two boys becoming 'blood brothers' after Lee saves Will from drowning. Lee finds Will's sketch book, full of colourful and glorious ideas, and starts to incorporate some of them into his film script. The two become best friends, but Will has to keep it secret from his family and the increasingly interfering Brother Joshua of the Brethren, who clearly has designs on his mother. French exchange students arrive, of whom the suave Didier Revol  becomes very popular. After finding Will's sketch book, he asks Will if he and his acolytes can play in the film, and Will agrees. Didier reveals that he has always wanted to be an actor. This mushrooms into the whole school being part of the production, and Will being included with the cool sixth-formers. Lee does not like this, as he is no longer in control, and finally quits after a fight with Will during filming of the last sequence, which takes place at a disused power station. After Will becomes trapped when part of the unstable structure collapses due to Didier's carelessness, and the entire school/crew run away, Lee returns to rescue his friend, but uses the excuse that he has come to collect his brother's camera. He too gets hurt, and has to go to hospital. Lawrence visits him, but is angry about the fact that the camera is broken. Will's mother , from whom he has struggled to hide his activities, finally realises that her son must be allowed to be himself and her family leaves the Brethren. The film is never submitted to the competition as they miss the deadline. The French students leave, and while Didier was popular and worshiped in England, his own school-mates mock him, and he is actually lonely and isolated. When Lawrence looks at Lee's footage he is impressed, and he sees Lee's rant at Will defending Lawrence's neglect and bullying, which was accidentally filmed. With Will's help, he adds a part in which he acts himself — including a reply message for his brother.

Héctor looks at the forest behind their house with binoculars, when he sees someone who turns out to be a young woman undressing. His wife leaves to go shopping so he investigates, only to be stabbed and chased by a mysterious man wearing pink bandages on his face. After fleeing and breaking into a mysterious building, Héctor is contacted by a scientist , who warns him of the bandaged man and guides him to his location, promising safety. The scientist convinces Héctor to hide from the bandaged man in a large mechanical device. However, when he leaves the machine, he discovers that he has traveled several hours back in time. The scientist explains that the machine is an experimental time travel device, and dubs Héctor ""Héctor 2"". The scientist tells him that they need to stay where they are and let the events unfold as normal. Despite the scientist's objections, Héctor 2 eventually flees in the scientist's car, only to be run off the road by a truck, cutting his head which he wraps in the bandage from his arm wound. After being rescued by the young girl whom he earlier viewed in the forest, he proceeds to try to replicate the events that he previously witnessed as Héctor 1. The girl escapes, and Héctor 2 returns to his home where he hears a scream, ending up chasing a woman through his house and onto the roof. When he attempts to grab her, she slips and falls to her death. Seeing the body from the roof, Héctor believes he has accidentally killed his wife. Héctor then contacts the scientist over a walkie-talkie and, remembering Héctor 1, convinces the scientist to lure his past self to the lab with warnings that he is being pursued. After driving to the lab, Héctor 2 insists that he must travel one more time, much to the objections of the scientist, who reveals that there is a Héctor 3, who not only dictated the events of the film but also stated that he must stop Héctor 2. After removing his bandages, Héctor 3 convinces the scientist to send him back several seconds before Héctor 2 appears. On arriving, he takes another vehicle, and follows Héctor 2. He runs Héctor 2 off the road, but crashes his own vehicle, knocking himself unconscious. On waking several hours later, he contacts the scientist by walkie-talkie and tells him he has failed, and to stop Héctor 2 by any means. He accidentally surprises the girl, causing her to scream. Since Héctor 2 is following the noise, Héctor 3 and the young girl take refuge in Héctor's house. Upon finding his wife, who is startled by Héctor 2 approaching the house, Héctor 3 hides his wife in his shed before setting up the events that lead to the roof accident; most notably, he finds the young girl, cuts her ponytail off and gives her his wife's coat, and tells her to run upstairs. Whilst the events on the roof unfold, Héctor 3 sits on his lawn with his wife; while Héctor 2 accidentally kills the young girl and drives off in the wife's car, Héctor 3 prevents his wife from interfering as emergency vehicles are heard approaching in the distance."

A car narrowly misses colliding into them on the road, brakes and then continues on towards a house with iron gates. A man in a jacket gets out from the car, opens the garage door and is shot from behind multiple times. The entire movie is then shown as a flashback, building up to the present shooting, a tool used numerous times in the film when the story goes back and forth between the flashback and flashbacks within the flashback. The story is about a gang of five that run a gambling club and conduct other underhand deals. The five members are Vikram , Seshadri , Shardul ([[Zakir Hussain , Prakash  and Shiva . When one of Seshadri's police contacts from Bangalore, Kalyan  promises him ""French furniture""  worth Rs. 5 crores for Rs. 2.5 crores, Seshadri calls for all 5 members to contribute Rs. 50 Lakh each to set the deal in motion. Based on Shardul's promise of being able to sell the furniture for more than Rs. 5 crore, each member anticipates a profit of a further Rs. 50 lakh each, at least. Shiva is to take the money to Bangalore by train. Vikram plans to take all the money by making Shiva unconscious using Chloroform poison. In the pretext of going to Goa for business work, he goes about his plot, driving to Pune where he uses the name Johnny G. But plans go wrong and Vikram has to kill Shiva who has just seen his face before going unconscious. Now Sheshadri, Kalyan, Prakash, Shardul, in turn and individually, find out Vikram's crime and are killed by him. Finally, Vikram is killed by Prakash's wife who mistakes him for Shardul, who she believed was Prakash's killer."

While his brother becomes drawn into left-wing politics, Accio, the hotheaded younger brother, is taken under the wing of a market trader and while under his influence, joins the Fascist party. Accio  is a nickname he is proud of because it makes him seem tough. Manrico and their sister Violetta are alarmed to hear their brother listening to Benito Mussolini's speeches in his room. Manrico often physically torments his brother, including stuffing his head in the barrel under the drain pipe of their house. Accio once runs away from home because his mother voted for the Houses Party. Their house is falling apart and she thinks the Houses Party will help them rebuild it. As Accio and Manrico get older they start demonstrating as members of the Fascist party and the Communist movement respectively.  The film is relatively even handed in its treatment of politics. If the young fascists seem absurd with their chanting of 'Duce! Duce!', and their actions constantly tending to violence, the communists are hardly less so: Schiller's words in the final movement of Beethoven's choral symphony are replaced by a hymn in praise of Mao Zedong, Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin; a meeting of activists consists of a room full of bearded men all shouting at once and only agreeing when the time comes to shout a slogan. Francesca, Manrico's girlfriend, becomes Accio's friend. Accio secretly likes her and thinks that she should not stay with Manrico because ""he can't be depended on"". The viewer is in little doubt that Accio is also attracted to Francesca himself. At the same time, he has himself become sexually involved with the wife of his fascist friend, the market trader, who has been imprisoned for his violent political activities. She buys him a car through an installment plan. Eventually Accio ends up leaving the Fascist party and tearing up his membership card when party members burn his brother's car. He also breaks up with his older lover, telling her that he cares for someone else, but not replying when asked if he is loved in return. But while Accio largely pulls out of political activism, his brother is drawn deeper into revolutionary violence. After disappearing for two years, he calls home. Accio travels to meet him and telephones Francesca, who twice quickly hangs up on him. When they meet in a cafe, Manrico sees Francesca arriving unexpectedly, but also the police who have perhaps been tailing her or tapping her telephone. He flees but dies in an exchange of  fire with the pursuing police. Accio then breaks into the corrupt and inefficient housing office to seize the waiting keys and the records of the homeless. He distributes keys and a party of homeless families take possession in the middle of the same night. The film ends with Accio living with his family, including his brother's small son."

James searches for a summer job, but can only find an unappealing one at Adventureland, a local amusement park in his hometown of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where his immature childhood friend Tommy Frigo ([[Matt Bush  works. James is hired by assistant manager Bobby  and is assigned to the games area. He meets his co-workers: the sarcastic Joel , Bobby's wife and park manager Paulette , Sue O'Malley , Mark , the alluring Lisa P. , and the park's technician Mike Connell , a part-time musician. Another games worker, Emily ""Em"" Lewin , saves James from being stabbed by a disgruntled customer. While her father and stepmother are away, Em has a party where she and James get to know each other. After the party, Connell, who has been having an affair with Em, comes over to further pursue the affair. Later that week, James goes for a drink with Em and she is surprised to learn James has never had sex. After leaving, James and Em share their first kiss. The following day, James tells Connell about his strong feelings for Em, which Connell reports to her. Em later tells James that she wants to take things slow due to problems in her life, leaving James feeling confused and upset. Sue drunkenly makes out with Joel, but rejects him the next day, saying that her Catholic parents would not allow her to date a Jew; outraged, Em calls her an anti-Semite in front of the entire staff. Lisa P. asks James out on a date, but he has mixed feelings because of his relationship with Em. After Connell talks him into going, presumably to sabotage James' relationship with Em, he decides to accept her offer to go out. After the date, during which Lisa and James kiss, James learns Em had called to tell him that she regrets having rejected his feelings. James gives Em some of his marijuana to bake pot cookies to cheer her up. Joel later sees James and Em walking together and, irritated by the whole chain of events, decides to quit. James tries to talk him out of quitting, but Joel has had enough of it all. He also tells James he is angry at him for dating Lisa P. when he is already in love with Em. Wanting to be honest, James tells Em about going out with Lisa P. After hearing of this, Em goes to Connell's mother's home to end their affair.

James goes to Connell's mother's house, which is where Lisa P. told him that Connell takes girls to have sex, and sees Em leaving. Shocked to see James, Em becomes tongue-tied and cannot explain. James leaves angrily, leaving a broken-hearted, crying Em by herself. James tells Lisa P. about the affair and asks her not to tell anyone, but not long after, she tells her friend Kelly. Upon noticing that all the park employees know, Em quits and moves back to New York. James chastises Lisa P. for dismissing Em as a ""homewrecker"" while seeing Connell as blameless. Heartbroken, he drunkenly crashes his dad's car into a tree and passes out. The next morning, his mother angrily wakes him up and tells him that he has to pay using his summer earnings to fix the damage. Because he must pay for the car, James doesn't have enough money to go to graduate school.

Such a simple story of love is entertaining as well as inspiring. Moreover, the blend of the pre-Independence political backdrop with the simple love life of the newlywed is excellently portrayed. On one hand you have the caricature of a typical Babu, who’s hell-bent on getting the ‘Raibahadur’ title from the British rulers played excellently by non other than Utpal Dutt, and on the other hand you have Biswajit, a Swadeshi who is out to teach the British rulers a lesson. The main focus is on Ayan, a notorious boy. To curb him, his parents get him married to Utpal Dutt’s daughter, Mohua. But he creates havoc in his in-laws’ house as well. The interplay between the two, their becoming friends, missing each other, understanding responsibilities towards each other all make for a charming love story. This is essentially a comedy with Tom Sawyeresque leanings laced elegantly into the fabric of Bengal of the late 19th or early 20th century. In the subtle backdrop of the Indian freedom movement, it is the story of the transformation of a young boy's innocent but naughty childhood to an appreciation of the Swadeshi movement and the growth of adolescent love for a girl even younger than him. The comedy is exceedingly natural and free-flowing. It includes a number of beautifully rendered traditional Bengali songs and is punctuated by a series of stand-offs faced by the young boy, mostly with unfavourable results for the opposing party. At heart, it is a beautiful pre-pubescent/adolescent love story. It was a huge box-office success when it came out and is an oft-watched movie even today.

Humbug  obviously a word play on Scrooge's catch phrase, ""bah humbug"". Scrooge  is portrayed as the tightwad Charles Dickens intended him to be with his consistent resistance to assist the poor or even have Christmas dinner with his nephew Fred, performed by Dennis Day and his family. In hopes of resuscitating the goodness of his one-time friend, the ghost of Jacob Marley , Scrooge's former business partner, visits Scrooge in his mansion, exhorting him to change his ways. Scrooge deems this to be madness and soon prepares for bed. Nevertheless, Scrooge's attitude soon changes after a fateful night wherein three ghosts also visit him and take him through his past and present, and show him what his future would be like if he does not change. Scrooge sees a younger caricature of himself, voiced by Robert Morse and realizes how greedy and miserly he has become. The Ghost of Christmas Present  proceeds to take Scrooge to the home of his diligent employee Bob Cratchit and discovers just how much poverty Cratchit and his family wallow in. Cratchit's crippled son Tiny Tim  touches Scrooge's heart and instigates a transformation within his personality. The production concludes with Scrooge assisting those less fortunate than himself."

Chand approaches her new life and land with equanimity and grace, and at times the wide-eyed optimism of hope—her first snowfall is a tiny miracle of beauty, and the roar of Niagara Falls creates the excitement of new beginnings. But soon optimism turns to isolation as the family she has inherited struggles beneath the weight of unspoken words, their collective frustration becoming palpable. No one feels the pressure more than Rocky, weighed down by familial obligations. A controlling mother who can’t let him go, a sweet but ineffectual father, and a sister whose two children and unemployed husband are also a burden. All live with Rocky and Chand in a two-bedroom house in the suburbs of Toronto. To make matters worse, Rocky is expected to find the money to bring his extended family to Canada. Unable to express his anger, he finds other ways to release it and it’s Chand who bears the brunt of his repressed rage.

Rosa sees past the make-up that covers Chand’s bruised face. Realizing Chand has nowhere to turn, Rosa gives her a magical root advising her “to put it in whatever the bastard drinks.” The root is supposed to seduce the one who takes it, making them fall hopelessly in love with the person who gives it to them.

Everything is new and unfamiliar to Chand including the quiet and shy Rocky who she meets for the first time at the Arrivals level of Pearson Airport. Chand approaches her new life and land with equanimity and grace, and at times the wide-eyed optimism of hope—her first snowfall is a tiny miracle of beauty, and the roar of Niagara Falls creates the excitement of new beginnings. But soon optimism turns to isolation as the family she has inherited struggles beneath the weight of unspoken words, their collective frustration becoming palpable. No one feels the pressure more than Rocky, weighed down by familial obligations. A controlling mother who can’t let him go, a sweet but ineffectual father, and a sister whose two children and unemployed husband are also a burden. All live with Rocky and Chand in a two-bedroom house in the suburbs of Toronto. To make matters worse, Rocky is expected to find the money to bring his extended family to Canada. Unable to express his anger, he finds other ways to release it and it’s Chand who bears the brunt of his repressed rage. Trapped in a world she cannot comprehend and unable to please her husband, Chand is desperate.

Rosa sees past the make-up that covers Chand’s bruised face. Realizing Chand has nowhere to turn, Rosa gives her a magical root advising her “to put it in whatever the bastard drinks.” The root is supposed to seduce the one who takes it, making them fall hopelessly in love with the person who gives it to them. Chand’s attempts with the magic root lead to surreal incidents and her life gradually begins to mirror an Indian fable involving a King Cobra.

At first, he is not satisfied with the arrangement, and continues to express his rebellious behavior. Already on his first day, he plans on running away, but crossing a harness racing track convinces him to stay in Indiana. The owner, Godaw Boole  welcomes Sparke, and introduces him to Char Bruce , a tomboyish girl who loves to race horses. Through a colored servant  informs him that his uncle Thunder Bolt  was once part of harness horse racing as a respected sulky driver. Returning home, Sparke informs his family about his love for horses, but Thunder orders him to put his focus on school instead. The next day, he ignores his uncle's demands and visits the racing track, where his instinctive rapport of a stallion impresses Godaw's seductive daughter, Cri-Cri . She convinces Jed Bruce  to help Sparke learn how to drive. Even though he performs poorly during his first trainings, Sparke is allowed to come back due to his humility. While bonding with Char and Cri-Cri, he learns how to successfully guide a harness horse. One night, Thunder becomes drunk and reacts violently towards Sparke. Due to his confusion, Thunder's wife Penny  explains that Thunder was once partners with Boole, until Boole's harsh treatment of a mare led to a quarrel. Thunder has retired from horseback riding ever since, but still feels an urge to return. Moved by the story, Sparke becomes desperate to help out his uncle and starts collecting documents that helps Thunder's only remaining horse with her delivery. Thunder is initially furious at Sparke for intefering, but he is grateful for the outcome. Meanwhile, Sparke's growing infatuation with Cri-Cri causes him to shift away from the track regularly.

Sparke is not aware that Char is madly in love with him, and instead considers her as 'one of the guys'. Meanwhile, he continues to train the horse's foal, who, during her first race, is seriously injured. Shortly after her recovery, Sparke realizes how Char feels about him and responds to her love. Thunder has since found out that the foal is going blind, but nevertheless allows Sparke to race her. Through determination and skills, he wins the race.

At first, he is not satisfied with the arrangement, and continues to express his rebellious behavior. Already on his first day, he plans on running away, but crossing a harness racing track convinces him to stay in Indiana. The owner, Godaw Boole  welcomes Sparke, and introduces him to Char Bruce , a tomboyish girl who loves to race horses. Through a colored servant  informs him that his uncle Thunder Bolt  was once part of harness horse racing as a respected sulky driver. Returning home, Sparke informs his family about his love for horses, but Thunder orders him to put his focus on school instead. The next day, he ignores his uncle's demands and visits the racing track, where his instinctive rapport of a stallion impresses Godaw's seductive daughter, Cri-Cri . She convinces Jed Bruce  to help Sparke learn how to drive. Even though he performs poorly during his first trainings, Sparke is allowed to come back due to his humility. While bonding with Char and Cri-Cri, he learns how to successfully guide a harness horse. One night, Thunder becomes drunk and reacts violently towards Sparke. Due to his confusion, Thunder's wife Penny  explains that Thunder was once partners with Boole, until Boole's harsh treatment of a mare led to a quarrel. Thunder has retired from horseback riding ever since, but still feels an urge to return. Moved by the story, Sparke becomes desperate to help out his uncle and starts collecting documents that helps Thunder's only remaining horse with her delivery. Thunder is initially furious at Sparke for intefering, but he is grateful for the outcome. Meanwhile, Sparke's growing infatuation with Cri-Cri causes him to shift away from the track regularly. Cri-Cri feels that he is too young to take seriously, though, and prefers the attention of Gordon Bradley . Sparke is not aware that Char is madly in love with him, and instead considers her as 'one of the guys'. Meanwhile, he continues to train the horse's foal, who, during her first race, is seriously injured. Shortly after her recovery, Sparke realizes how Char feels about him and responds to her love.

Their antics get them carried away, as they stray over Soviet airspace. As they are being escorted back into U.S. airspace, one of the Soviet planes has Doug on missile-lock. Doug requests to break formation and engage the Soviet aircraft, but is denied by flight control. He is immediately shot down, but safely ejects and lands on Soviet land, where he is promptly captured by nearby soldiers. Several years have passed since that incident and Doug is still haunted by his days as a prisoner. He works as a crop duster, but is shortly recruited by retired Gen. Charles ""Chappy"" Sinclair to be an instructor at his flight school. Chappy needs Doug's help, as his school is overrun by juvenile delinquents who fly his T-6 Texans with no regard for safety. These students were taken in by Chappy as a means of rehabilitating them. Doug is not happy to be an instructor to the delinquents, but Chappy assures him that he will see results from them in a week. Still, he shows no interest in training them. During an exhibition show where the delinquents face off children from the Air Force, Wheeler, one of the female delinquents, cons a drug dealer out of $2,000 by handing him a bag of sugar disguised as cocaine. She attempts to take her training plane and fly out to Mexico, but Doug pursues her and tells her to land on an abandoned Air Force base and stay there until further orders. Upon landing the plane, Wheeler and her co-pilot Rudy Marlowe encounter a platoon that is ordered to kill them. Doug intervenes, allowing the teens to leave the air base. Chappy is told of the incident, and he and Maj. Gen. Brad Kettle head to the base that night to investigate on that platoon's activity on a storage bunker. After they are escorted out of the base by Air Force Intelligence, Doug describes to Chappy his eyewitness account of the soldiers carrying marked canisters, which are revealed to be chemical weapons. Doug leaves the school, frustrated that his life came apart when he was imprisoned and Chappy was not there to save him that time. Chappy is given a notice by the State Patrol that his flight program is terminated immediately and his students are returned to juvenile hall. Wheeler, however, avoids capture and steals a trainer plane, creating a diversion that allows the students to hijack the bus and head back to the school. Chappy and the students relocate their planes to Doug's former job site; Doug meets up with them afterward. Chappy then organizes the students to infiltrate the airbase and acquire enough resources for their operation to stop the convoy carrying the chemical weapons. Upon entering the airbase, Kitty Shaw uses her computer hacking skills to gain access to classified data. She and Chappy discover Operation Pandora, in which the chemical weapons are to be used on countries with regimes deemed hostile. They print out the data before leaving the premises and handing it to Kettle. Meanwhile, Dana Osborne and Rudy attempt to stop the convoy, but are shot down. As they attempt to escape on foot, Rudy is shot, but Doug and the others arrive at the scene and capture one of the soldiers. Chappy and his team accompany Kettle to Craig Air Force Base, only to realize that Kettle is part of the entire operation. Using a swarm of wasps as a means of psychological interrogation, Doug gets the captured soldier to reveal the location of the convoy. He then phones Chappy, but discovers that his team has been apprehended by Kettle. At one of the chemical weapon chambers, Chappy is told by Kettle that the first target of Operation Pandora is Cuba. After Kettle leaves the chamber, Kitty hacks the computer to set off the fire extinguishing units, giving Chappy's team time to escape. A stray shot from one of the soldiers ruptures the canister, contaminating the chamber and killing Dr. Francis Gully and everyone inside. As Kitty and Peter sneak into the cargo plane carrying the chemical weapon, Chappy sends a radio message, warning everyone of a hostile aircraft heading to Cuba. Shortly after recapturing Chappy, Kettle orders his fighter squadron to shoot down the trainer planes. The squadron of two fighters attacks the trainers, only to be confronted by Doug, who has commandeered a fighter plane. Doug and the students shoot down the attackers promptly. He then plays the cassette tape Chappy recorded for him before killing ace pilot Maj. Miles Pierce in a dogfight. The students approach the cargo plane and attack it. Inside, Peter creates a diversion by opening the cargo door, causing the soldiers aboard to fall out. This leads to a fist fight between Peter and the plane's captain, who is ejected when Kitty assumes the controls. Peter then jettisons all of the canisters into the ocean. Seeing his mission as a failure, Kettle prepares to kill Chappy when Doug suddenly attacks the airbase, giving Chappy time to escape. As police arrive at the scene, Kettle enters the contaminated chamber - his fate unknown. Days later, Wheeler tells Doug she is heading to Mexico for a new start, but he convinces her to stay. The Iron Eagle Flight School then prepares for a new batch of students fresh out of juvenile hall."

Too bad his future in-laws are anything but.{{imdb title}} Dalen, now a college professor of Mormon mythology, has almost given up on finding an eternal companion in his current singles ward, as scores of his friends around him get married or already have several children. His hopes are renewed when Christine moves into the ward, and they fall in love; love at first sight in Dalen's case. Christine's parents are very wealthy non-members who have each been married a few times. Trouble arises when they tell Christine's parents about their marriage plans because Christine's parents can't understand why they're not permitted to attend their daughter's wedding in the LDS Temple. Dalen actually withdraws his proposal to Christine in order to avoid causing a rift in her family. Later on, however, Dalen visits Christine's father and explains to him the importance of temple marriage, and he gives Dalen his blessing. Christine and Dalen's wedding goes as planned. During the film, Jonathan  is making a film based on their experience in the Singles Ward. When Jonathan's friends visit the set, they each see the actor playing them. Dalen is played by, ""Some guy who's been in every LDS movie ever made,"" who looks exactly like Dalen . While discussing making a movie about Dalen's experience in getting married, Jonathan says that franchises must be made in trilogies, but with everyone married the next one would have to be The Family Ward. Dalen even mentioned this dream that he had where he was a return missionary and the problems he and Jonathan encountered."

He starts with the transportation system and then moves onto industry. He demands tribute from railroad magnates and other captains of industry. Richard Wentworth , an amateur criminologist who is friendly with the police, is secretly ""The Spider,"" a masked vigilante equally determined to wipe the Octopus and his gang off the face of the earth. Pleasant and smiling in civilian life, Wentworth is often ruthless as the Spider, slinging two guns against the public enemies who attack him. Wentworth also masquerades as affable underworld lowlife Blinky McQuade. Disguised as McQuade, Wentworth can infiltrate gangland at the hired-gun level and keep current on the gang's plans. The only people who know Wentworth's other identities are his assistants Jackson  and Ram Singh , his butler Jenkins , and his fiancée Nita . The Octopus was a villain in a single issue pulp believed to have been written by Norvell Page who wrote most of The Spider pulp stories. He is garbed completely in white and is only ever seen sitting in a chair. Unlike the pulps, The Spider is garbed in a lightweight full length costume with web-like markings on it which resemble Spiderman's costume. The serial follows the standard formula of fights, shoot-outs, Wentworth's friends being kidnapped at various times and having to be rescued. Each chapter ends with The Spider or his friends in deep trouble, often about to be killed, but the effect is spoiled by a trailer for the next episode which shows them in full health and fighting the villains. The HQ of The Octopus is found by The Spider in the last episode. He has unwittingly given himself away to Wentworth and realises that only Wentworth could know, so of course he must die. The Spider uses his line  a number of times to get out of trouble. Commissioner Kirk  suspects that Wentworth is The Spider in one episode. The Octopus's gang wore robes too . He ruthlessly executed all who failed him and in case of trouble, used a false arm, so concealing a gun hidden by his robes, held by his real arm.
1339563{{Plot}} In the last days of December 1999, Los Angeles has become a dangerously volatile war zone. As a group of criminals rob a Chinese restaurant, the event is recorded by a robber wearing a 'SQUID', or ""Superconducting Quantum Interference Device"", which records events directly from the wearer's cerebral cortex, and when played back through a MiniDisc-like device allow a user to experience the recorder's memory as if was his or her own. Lenny Nero  is a former LAPD officer turned black marketeer who deals in bootleg SQUID recordings. His main supplier, Tick , tries to sell the robbery clip to him. Lenny initially refuses, due to the recording ending with the wearer's death, but eventually agrees to buy it at a reduced price, intending to edit it. Meanwhile, a call girl named Iris  is being chased by two police officers as she flees to the subway, jumping aboard one of the trains. As the train departs, one of the officers shatters a window and grabs Iris; her wig is pulled off as she struggles, revealing a SQUID recorder headset inside. While Lenny acts smooth with his clients, in private he pines for his ex-girlfriend Faith , while relying on his two best friends, bodyguard Lornette ""Mace"" Mason  and private investigator Max Peltier , for emotional support. Mace's relationship with Lenny is strained, due to her unrequited feelings for him and her disapproval of his SQUID-dealing business. While the three are drinking together at a bar, Iris arrives, drops a disc through the sunroof of Lenny's car and attempts to explain her predicament to him, but flees when she sees police nearby. Lenny's illegally-parked car is towed away before Lenny can find the disc. Hours later, Lenny receives a ""blackjack""  SQUID from an anonymous sender, and watches in horror as Iris gets brutally raped and strangled to death. Disturbed by the recording and Iris's warnings about Faith's safety, Lenny tries to get Faith away from her new boyfriend, music industry mogul Philo Gant , but to no avail. Lenny later receives more snuff tapes. He and Mace discover that the deaths are tied to a cover-up of the murder of rapper and social commentator Jeriko One  and one of his band mates by two renegade LAPD officers. As they are hunted by the two policemen, Burton Steckler and Dwayne Engelman , Lenny discovers that Iris witnessed  the murders. Lenny, Mace, and Max meet at Tick's on New Year's Eve, only to discover that Tick has been rendered brain-dead from exposure to highly amplified SQUID recordings. Mace insists that the truth behind Jeriko's murder go public, but Max insinuates that if it did, the city would destroy itself from within. Lenny concludes that the assault on Tick was committed by the same person that killed Iris and fears Faith will be next. Lenny and Mace confront Faith about the truth behind Jeriko's death. Faith mentions that Philo has been monitoring his inner circle. Concerned that Jeriko might be looking for a new manager, Philo hired Iris to spy on him. Realizing that Philo must have ordered the killer to murder Iris, Lenny convinces Faith to escape with them, but Philo's henchmen stop them. As midnight approaches, Lenny and Mace sneak into a private New Year's party at the Bonaventure Hotel that Philo is hosting for the city's wealthy elite. Lenny gives the disk to Mace so she can deliver it to Deputy Police Commissioner Palmer Strickland . Upon entering Philo's penthouse suite, Lenny finds another SQUID disk which shows Faith apparently being raped and killed. Refusing to watch anymore, Lenny finds a body covered in bedsheets and pulls the sheets aside to find Philo, whose brain has been overwhelmed in the same manner as Tick's. Lenny watches the remainder of the clip and discovers the killer is Max. He only pretended to kill Faith and it becomes apparent that the two have become lovers. In the clip, Philo enters the room and Max forces him to run the amplified recording. After the clip ends, Max and Faith enter the room. Max disarms Lenny and shoots Philo with Lenny's gun, explaining that he set Philo up because he wanted to have Faith killed for what she knew about Jeriko One's death, and that he now intends to frame Lenny for Philo's murder. As Max is about to shoot Lenny, Faith has a change of heart and attacks Max. In the ensuing fight, Lenny tries to throw Max off the balcony and Max grabs Lenny's necktie, leaving both of them dangling from the railing over the street below. Lenny manages to pull Max's knife out of his shoulder  and cut his tie off, and Max falls to his death. Outside the hotel, Mace is pursued by Steckler and Engelman. She manages to subdue both of them, cuffing them to a scaffold, only for other nearby police officers to brutally beat her, triggering a riot in the crowd. Commissioner Strickland appears and restores order, having watched the recording of the murders, and orders the two officers arrested. As they are read their rights, Engelman grabs a pistol from one of the officers and commits suicide, and Steckler is gunned down by the police when he tries to shoot Mace. As Lenny and Mace are being treated for their wounds, Faith is arrested for Philo's murder. At the stroke of midnight , Lenny and Mace share a passionate kiss.

10811554Dolores Claiborne , a strong-willed and sarcastic woman, works as a domestic servant in a coastal town in Maine. The film opens with Dolores having an argument with her elderly, paralyzed employer Vera Donovan , after which Vera falls down the stairs. Dolores ransacks the kitchen and is then caught by a mailman as she stands over Vera with a rolling pin, apparently intending to kill Vera. Vera dies and the police begin an investigation, believing Dolores murdered Vera. The police, however, do not charge Dolores with a crime. Dolores' daughter, Selena St. George , a successful but depressed and alcoholic journalist, arrives in town to support her mother. Dolores insists that she did not kill her wealthy employer, but she finds little sympathy, as the entire town believes she murdered her husband, Joe St. George  almost 20 years earlier. some of the town's inhabitants harass her by vandalising her home, taunting her in the street and driving by her house, screaming at her. Detective John Mackey , who was the chief detective in her husband's murder case, is determined to put Dolores away for life. Selena also believes that Dolores killed her father, and so has not spoken to her mother in over a decade. Selena did not witness Dolores killing her father. As the film develops, it is revealed that Joe was an abusive alcoholic, and that one night Dolores had threatened to kill him if he ever harmed her again. The film's flashbacks also reveal that Dolores started to suspect Joe of molesting Selena. Dolores went to work for Vera Donovan as a housemaid in order to raise enough money to pay for Selena's education, but upon realizing that Joe had been molesting Selena, she goes to the bank to withdraw her money so she and Selena can flee Joe's wrath. The plan backfired, however, when the bank notifies Dolores that Joe stole the money from Selena's savings account. Back in the present, Dolores says that Vera had thrown herself down the staircase and, tired of her disabled life, begged Dolores to put her out of her misery, something Mackey refuses to believe; he reveals that Vera has left her entire fortune to Dolores. Mackey informs them that the will is eight years old, which nearly convinces Selena that her mother is guilty. After a fierce argument, Selena storms out, leaving her mother to fend for herself. Dolores finally decides that it is time to reveal the truth to Selena: She did in fact kill Joe, and it was actually Vera who suggested the plan to her. Dolores says that she had been pushed to the breaking point upon realizing that Joe had been molesting Selena, which Selena furiously denies. In a flashback to a scene some 20 years before, Vera engages in her regular ritual of berating Dolores, who breaks down crying and confesses her troubled home life. An unusually sympathetic Vera implies that she killed her late husband Jack, and engineered it to look like an accident. Vera's confession forms a bond between the two women and allows Dolores to take control of her own situation and future. As a total solar eclipse approaches, Dolores and Selena have an argument about Dolores' suspicions regarding Joe's sexual abuse of Selena. Selena flees home for the weekend to work at a hotel to raise money from the high number of tourists coming to watch the eclipse. Joe soon returns from working on a fishing boat, and as a treat, Dolores has bought him a bottle of Scotch. After Joe gets drunk, Dolores reveals that she knows that Joe has stolen from Selena's account and molested his own daughter. Dolores intentionally insults Joe and lures him into falling down an old well, leaving him to die as he plunges to the stone bottom. Selena hears the story on a tape left for her by Dolores, who had foreseen her departure. While on the ferry, Selena suddenly uncovers a repressed memory of her father forcing her to give him a handjob. She rushes back to her mother, who is attending the coroner's inquest, in which Mackey makes a case she be sent to a grand jury in an attempt to indict her for murder. Selena tells the police they have no evidence and that despite an often-stormy relationship, Vera and Dolores loved each other. Knowing that he has no admissible evidence, Mackey reluctantly drops the case. The film ends with Dolores and Selena making amends on the ferry wharf before Selena returns to New York.

3565940Nick Venizelos , a prosperous small-town barber, provides his customers with gambling in his back room. He is so lucky that one suggests he go to the big city to take on famous gambler named Hickory Short. Not lacking in self-confidence, Nick puts up half of the $10,000 stake himself, while the others raise the rest. He leaves the shop under the supervision of his assistant, Jack , and takes the train into the city. He learns from Marie, the pretty blonde working at the hotel cigar stand, where Hickory is holding his illegal, high stakes poker game. Nick sits down at the game, but loses all his money. Later, however, he sees a newspaper article reporting that the real Hickory Short has just been released from prison far away in Florida.

When Nick foolishly tries to get his money back, Sleepy Sam and the other fake poker players beat him up. After he gets out of the hospital, he vows to get revenge. Nick goes back to barbering and raises another stake. Six months later, he tracks down Sleepy Sam and his gang in another city. He proposes a one-on-one game, each man putting up $50,000 and playing until one man has all the money. Sam accepts. Nick insists on sending out for fresh decks of cards, just to be safe.

Andaz was one of the last movies for which the great music directors duo, Shankar- Jaikishan composed music together. Jaikishan died of cirrhosis of the liver on 12 September 1971 at the young age of 42. One of the most popular songs from this film - ""Zindagi Ek Safar Hai Suhana""  turned out to be the last song that Jaikishan recorded before his death. Andaz also proved to be the last hit for Shammi Kapoor as a lead hero. The success of this movie is credited to the Rajesh Khanna Mania of the 70's, as Rajesh Khanna only appeared for few minutes in the movie, and still created a stir. However, Shammi Kapoor's performance was well received and it is considered to have been one of the most uncharacteristic roles he undertook during his acting career.

8969561The pre-title scene shows Joshua , the main character, in a psychiatrist's office. Joshua is clearly refusing to cooperate with the shrink, who seems to favor repressive in place of persuasive approach. The brief dialogue in this scene is mainly filled with rather cheesy joke exchanges about transsexual brothers. The title screen is then shown. In the next scene, a huge number of police officers, including SWAT teams and snipers, is deploying around Joshua's school. Joshua has got a gun and has barricaded himself in the school counselor's office along with six students as hostages. Most of the film consist of flashbacks, depicting the events leading to the current situation. Some of these include Joshua being beaten by the school gang and his own father, being hanged by his collar from the school gate, and having his face shoved down the toilet. The flashbacks also show his brief relationship with Cathy , a popular student, and Sabina , a beautiful but introverted girl who sympathized with him. The police attempts to negotiate, aided by Mrs. Miranda, the school counselor, and Joshua's parents. During negotiations, Joshua tells about his frustration to everyone listening, including the press which is broadcasting the crisis nationally. Eventually he releases the female hostages, which includes Cathy, but keeps the males which consist of the gang members which have tormented him for so long. Announcing to them ""It's judgement time,"" he returns what they did to him. He makes them shove their leader's head into a toilet at gunpoint, and after demanding all the school students to come and watch, he hangs Jerry from the school roof. Again, Mrs. Miranda pleads Joshua to let the hostages go. Joshua refuses, claiming they deserve to die. However, the police have arrested the man who sold Joshua his gun, and he told them that Joshua only has one bullet. Mrs. Miranda uses this information to force Joshua into surrendering, since he won't be able to shoot all three hostages. However, that is not really his plan all along. As a squad of police officers move up to the roof to apprehend him, he points the gun to his head and kills himself.

1688060During the winter of 1943-44, Julien Quentin, a student at a Carmelite boarding school in occupied France, is returning to school from vacation. He acts tough to the students at the school, but he is actually a pampered mother's boy who still wets his bed. Saddened to be returning to the tedium of boarding school, Julien's classes seem uneventful until Père Jean, the headmaster, introduces three new pupils. One of them, Jean Bonnet, is the same age as Julien. Like the other students, Julien at first despises Bonnet, a socially awkward boy with a talent for arithmetic and playing the piano. One night, Julien wakes up and discovers that Bonnet is wearing a kippah and is praying in the Hebrew language. After digging through his new friend's locker, Julien learns the truth. His new friend's name is not Bonnet, but Jean Kippelstein. Père Jean, a compassionate, sacrificing priest of the old school, had agreed to grant a secret asylum to hunted Jews. After a game of treasure hunt, however, Julien and Jean bond and a close friendship develops between them. When Julien's mother visits on Parents' Day, Julien asks his mother if Bonnet, whose parents could not come, could accompany them to lunch at a gourmet restaurant. As they sit around the table, the talk turns to Julien's father, a factory owner. When Julien's brother asks if he is still for Marshal Pétain, Madame Quentin responds, ""No one is anymore."" However, the Milice arrive and attempt to expel a Jewish diner. When Julien's brother calls them, ""Collabos,"" the Milice commander is enraged and tells Madam Quentin, ""We serve France, madam. He insulted us."" However, when a Wehrmacht officer coldly orders them to leave, the Milice officers grudgingly obey. Julien's mother comments that the Jewish diner appears to be a very distinguished gentleman. She insists that she has nothing against Jews, but would not object if the socialist politician Léon Blum were hanged. Shortly thereafter, Joseph, the school's assistant cook, is exposed for selling the school's food supplies on the black market. He implicates several students as accomplices, including Julien and his brother, François. Although Père Jean is visibly distressed by the injustice, he fires Joseph but does not expel the students for fear of offending their wealthy and influential parents. On a cold morning in January 1944, the Gestapo raid the school. As his classroom is being searched, Julien unintentionally gives away Bonnet by looking in his direction. As the other two Jewish boys are hunted down, Julien encounters the person who denounced them, Joseph the kitchen hand. Trying to justify his betrayal in the face of Julien's mute disbelief, Joseph tells him, ""Don't act so pious. There's a war on, kid."" As the students are lined up in the school courtyard, a Gestapo officer denounces the illegal nature of Père Jean's actions. He further accuses all French people of being weak and undisciplined. Meanwhile, Père Jean and the three Jewish students are led away by the officers. Heartbroken, the children call out, ""Au revoir, mon père!"" Père Jean responds, ""Au revoir, les enfants! À bientôt!"" In a voiceover epilogue, an older Julien reveals that the passage of forty years still has not dimmed his memory of that horrible day. The children, he states, died at Auschwitz. Père Jean was imprisoned with other anti-Nazi priests at Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp, where he died shortly after being liberated.

Spotting his ex-wife in a bar one night, Rick gets into a fight with the man she's with, culminating in his beating the hapless man's car with a baseball bat. The board of education finds that Rick's behavior is reflecting poorly on the school district's image. They unanimously decide to transfer him to another school, in another district; Brandel High, a crime-ridden and gang-dominated institution, where he is made the new principal. Believing he can repair his image by cleaning up the school, Rick attempts to have an assembly to declare his intentions: ""No more."" No more drugs, running in the hallways or being late to class. While he's giving his speech, Victor Duncan , the leader of the main gang in the school, walks in, derides Rick in front of everyone, then walks out, which eventually results in a small riot, which earns Rick the enmity of not only the teachers but also school custodian Jake . Eventually, Rick manages to enforce his policy of getting rid of the drugs being dealt in the bathrooms and clearing out the hallways — but not always with success. Because the students are now forced to go to class, some of the more unruly students become increasingly disruptive, including White Zac , who eventually attempts to rape one of the teachers, Ms. Orozco , with whom Rick is beginning to form a close friendship. Victor, meanwhile, continues to assert his influence on the school, going so far as to brutally beat a former member of his gang and hang him by his ankles when the member warms to Rick and actually starts learning. The clash between Rick and Victor eventually leads to a showdown in the school halls, where Jake is temporarily locked inside a supply closet while Victor and his gang hunt Rick down. In the end, Victor and Rick fight each other with their fists, with Victor seemingly having the upper hand until Rick overpowers him. Rick beats Victor, much to the shock of the rest of the school who witness the beating. Several students cheer Rick on, much to the chagrin of Victor's gang members. After a small fight breaks out Rick again declares, ""No more!"" Victor is taken away in a police car, and as a student derisively asks, ""Hey man, who the hell do you think you are?"", Rick responds ""I'm the principal, man!"" and rides away on his motorcycle.

15352210In 1966, George W. Bush  endures an alcohol-fueled initiation by his fellow Yale University students as a Delta Kappa Epsilon pledge. During the hazing, Bush successfully recalls the names and nicknames of many of the fraternity members, and states that his family's political legacy is one in which he has no interest. A little later, after Bush is jailed in New Jersey for rowdiness following a football game, his father, George H. W. Bush , states that he will help Bush, but for the last time. Following his graduation from Yale, Bush takes a job at an oil patch back in his home state of Texas, but he quits after only a few weeks. Shortly after this, ""Junior"" reveals his real aspirations in a father-son talk: working in professional baseball, in some capacity. Soon afterwards, Bush is accepted into Harvard Business School with the help of his father. Later that night after drinking heavily, Bush crashes his car into his family estate and challenges his father to a fistfight. His brother, Jeb  intervenes and stops the fight. In 1977, Bush announces he will run for Congress in Texas. At a barbecue, Bush meets his future wife, Laura Lane Welch . During his congressional debate, Bush is criticized by his Democratic opponent, Kent Hance , who says that Bush is not a ""real Texan"" and has spent campaign contributions to throw an alcohol-fueled party for underage Texas Tech University students. Bush does poorly in the debate and loses the election, but with the highest number of votes for a Republican candidate in the state's history. Angered by his loss, Bush declares that he will ""never be out-Texas'd or out-Christianed again"". In 1986, Bush becomes a born-again Christian, gives up alcohol, and somewhat mends his relationship with his father. The elder Bush invites him to assist with what becomes his successful 1988 presidential campaign, although Bush himself suspects that he only was asked because Jeb was busy. Bush's political advisor, Karl Rove , tells him that he has the potential to make a name for himself, but has not yet done anything with his life.

Following the September 11 attacks in 2001, Bush labels three of America's enemies – specifically Iran, Iraq, and North Korea — as the ""axis of evil"". In 2002, Bush begins searching for evidence that Saddam was creating nuclear weapons, and has the army prepared. All of Bush's White House staff supports him except Secretary of State Colin Powell ([[Jeffrey Wright , who states that planning to invade Iraq would destabilize the country. Powell is generally is overruled by Vice President Dick Cheney  and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , who insist that the war – deliberately waged without an exit strategy — would secure the United States' status as sole global superpower while spreading democracy throughout the Middle East. In his State of the Union Address in 2003, Bush states that: ""Either you're with us, or you're with the terrorists."" In March of that year, the U.S. invades Iraq and at first, the war appears to be a success, and Bush gives his infamous ""Mission Accomplished"" speech on an aircraft carrier. When it becomes clear that there are no weapons of mass destruction within Iraq, Bush learns that the responsibility for finding them had been relegated far down the chain of command. Bush also discovers that Saddam gambled his regime and his life on the assumption that Bush was bluffing. Bush is asked in a White House press conference what mistakes he made as President, a question that leaves him flustered and speechless. That night, Bush has a nightmare in which his father accuses him of ruining his family's legacy, which the elder Bush claims was intended for Jeb. In the final scene of the film, Bush dreams of playing center field at a baseball game. Bush attempts to catch a pop fly, but it quickly disappears.

12155366{{Plot}} This cartoon is fairly simple, involving various antics that Jerry  pulls on Tom during his sleep and Jerry's subsequent efforts to stop them by staying awake. Tom is having his beauty sleep during the wee hours. 1:59 AM: Jerry sleepwalks out of his hole and pulls Tom's whiskers such that they align themselves on one side of his face. Tom wakes up in puzzlement and pushes his whiskers back to even lengths. He spots Jerry and holds him down with one finger and crouches angrily in front of the mouse. Jerry punches his jaw such that his lips cover Tom's face. Jerry laughs and walks away. Tom snaps his fingers and wakes Jerry up. Jerry turns around slowly in a ""hypnotic"" way and Tom flips his head such that it twists incessantly like an exercise wheel. Tom then hits him into his hole with a pool cue. Jerry recovers from running into his own wall and cluelessly shrugs. 2:25 AM: Jerry walks out and pulls Tom's tail so that it transforms into an umbrella. Tom wakes up, folds his tail back up, and starts to chase after Jerry, but his tail unfolds back into umbrella-form. Jerry laughs in the same banal-sounding voice used earlier and is woken up a second time. Tom angrily picks him up and ties him up with string. Tom unwinds the string and Jerry is thrown around the room like a top, bouncing off legs of chairs and walls in a way similar to his previous humiliation, and then falls into his hole, completely exhausted. 3:07 AM: Jerry walks out with a steak knife in order to start stabbing the cat, but sneezes and wakes up. Jerry gasps and guiltily returns the knife to his hole. 3:26 AM: Following from the previous sleepwalk mishap, Jerry gulps 11 or more cups of coffee in an attempt to stay awake. Jerry sits on a spool and his features droop, but he shakes them off twice. Jerry tries to open his eyelids, but they close all by themselves. He shakes this off, then dozes off and gets back up again, but his features droop a third time and he cannot keep from entering the world of dreams. Jerry then walks out and throws a brick at the cat, but sneezes and wakes up a second time. Jerry gasps in fear and opens the cat's eyes. Tom sees the brick coming straight at him, opens his mouth in panic, and thus swallows the red brick. Jerry waves at him and Tom throws him back into his hole and boards it up. 3:40 AM: Jerry pushes all 4 nails off the board covering his hole and opens it up. He is carrying a ball of yarn. Jerry ties one end to Tom's tail, spreads the yarn around the entire house and outside as well. Then, he ties the other end to an anvil and pushes it down the chimney. Tom is woken up with a start and is pulled around the house, squeezed through the tiniest gaps, and pulled up to the chimney before hitting his head on the anvil at the bottom of the chimney. The camera flips over and Tom cries and packs up. He leaves in the morning, where he is sweating to the Egyptian brim. Jerry follows, but he is still sleepwalking.
23160762The film opens with two top U.N.C.L.E. agents Napoleon Solo  and Illya Kuryakin  being attacked with missiles from small, personal helicopters while on their way to see Dr. Simon True. The attackers are with THRUSH and, though they fail to stop the agents, are the titular “Karate Killers”. Dr. True has discovered a process to extract gold from sea water. Fearing theft he hid the formula, and says that someone would have to “hunt down the four winds” to find it. But during his presentation of the process to U.N.C.L.E. he dies from apparently natural causes , and his dying words are that his daughter is the key to finding the formula. As the head of U.N.C.L.E., Alexander Waverly later informs Solo and Kuryakin that Dr. True has four step-daughters and one biological daughter . The consensus from his final words is that Dr. True sent each of his four step-daughters something that, when assembled, will mean something to Sandy and from which the formula can be discovered. So the two agents begin the search for each of the daughters to keep THRUSH from getting an unlimited supply of gold. Dr. True’s widow was having an affair with THRUSH operative Randolph, but he was only using her to get closer to Dr. True’s notes and formula. With no further use for her, Randolph orders her killed by the Karate Killers. Finding both her body and Dr. True’s biological daughter Sandy in his home at the start of their investigation, the agents recruit Sandy to come with them as they find her step-sisters. First, they visit Rome in search of Margo, who has married Count Valeriano De Fanzini. The Count is keeping Margo naked and captive in his ancestral home as he had married her for money but she had none. Solo and Kuryakin rescue Margo, fight with Randolph and the Karate Killers - who have followed them to Rome - and are saved by Sandy’s quick thinking. The Count and Margo make up after Sandy’s discovery of a hidden treasure and give the U.N.C.L.E. team the only thing that Dr. True has sent Margo of late: a photograph of himself with an obvious formula in the picture. Analysis by U.N.C.L.E. shows the formula to be nonsense, and so the agents conclude that it is one-quarter of the full formula. They next head to London to search for Sandy’s step-sister Imogen. They find Imogen arrested by a constable for indecent exposure , and Solo posts bail so they can talk to her. They all go to Imogen’s nightclub, fight with Randolph and the Karate Killers - who have now followed them to London - and are saved by constables who arrive at the last minute. Sandy discovers a similar photo of her father in Imogen’s dressing room, but with a different formula in the background. The agents leave as Imogen and the original constable are flirting. Armed with two of the four photos, the team heads to the Swiss Alps, where step-sister Yvonne lives in a hotel but is behind in her bill. Randolph, having gotten there before U.N.C.L.E., pays her debt and requests that she give him the photo of her step-father. Solo and Kuryakin have a fight with Karate Killers on skis, and Sandy saves the day be discovering the photograph before anyone else can. Yvonne and her wealthy boyfriend Carl thereafter resolve an argument and make up. Following this Randolph intercepts the team when they are leaving the Alps on an U.N.C.L.E. private jet, takes the three photos, and parachutes out leaving the rest to die. Sandy is able to escape her bonds, frees the two agents, and the plane is landed safely at the last minute. They avoid another trip as the fourth photo of Dr True has been published in a magazine. Having copies now of all four photos, U.N.C.L.E. determines that scientifically they are still nonsense. However, when the letters in the formulas are extracted and rearranged they spell “Japanese Lullaby”. Sandy has no clue what this means, but they take her to Japan anyway. Randolph, having determined the same thing, follows. The U.N.C.L.E. team is assaulted several times in Japan by the Karate Killers, Sandy is kidnapped and rescued by geishas, and she finally remembers a Japanese man who sang her lullabies as a child on a business trip. U.N.C.L.E. resources find the man, who gives Sandy the formula that her father sent him for safekeeping. At that moment Randolph and the Karate Killers, who have followed them again, overpower the team and take the formula. Randolph then takes the three of them to the THRUSH central facility at the pole , which serves as their main research and manufacturing station. By the time they get there the facility has been reconfigured to use Dr. True’s process and manufacture gold from sea water. Randolph wants to keep them alive long enough for them to see THRUSH’s success, but Solo and Kuryakin escape from their cell using explosives hidden in Solo’s shoelaces, sabotage the plant, and destroy the gold-making machinery. Randolph is killed in the process and covered in a film of gold dust. Solo, Kuryakin, Sandy, one of the geishas, and Mr. Waverly all then travel to London to see the double wedding of Imogen and the constable, and Yvonne and Carl. The Count and Contessa are also in attendance and it becomes clear that, absent a father, the girls’ “U.N.C.L.E.” has paid for the weddings.

At his sister's gynecology office, he answers the phone and speaks briefly with a young woman named Mavi Luppis  who is looking to make an appointment. She recognized his name and something sparks his imagination. He notes her name and address, and a few days later invites her to his Rome apartment where they make love. Sometime later, Niccolò receives a mysterious phone call from a man wanting to meet about a ""delicate matter"" at Fassi's ice cream parlor. Niccolò meets with the stranger who warns him about continuing his relationship with Mavi if he values his ""peace of mind"". Later at his apartment, Niccolò tells Mavi about the ""stooge"" who threatened him on behalf of one of her suitors. Mavi doesn't know who it could be. Wondering who is behind the threats, Niccolò asks Mavi to introduce him to some of her old aristocratic friends. They go to Dandini's restaurant where she's greeted by several old friends, including an older gentleman who stops her on the stairs and talks with her. Afterwards Mavi informs Niccolò that she feels uncomfortable and asks to leave. Mavi takes Niccolò to a dinner party given by some of her wealthy friends. Niccolò finds the aristo crowd cold and cliquish. Mavi makes the rounds talking to her friends, including a beautiful young blonde woman. Niccolò grows suspicious of Mavi, believing she knows the identity of her mysterious suitor. Mavi assures him that she is no longer with this crowd, and that she is now with him. Later she reveals that the man she met on the stairs at Dandini's was a ""family friend"" who she recently discovered was her father. With tears in her eyes, she recounts how she avoided him for years not knowing who he was, and all the time he was unable to show his love to his daughter. After Niccolò's sister is passed over for a promotion, Niccolò suspects that the jealous suitor is now trying to get to him through his family. When he notices someone watching his house, Niccolò and Mavi drive out to the country where he's rented a farmhouse. Along the way they encounter thick fog on the road. At a caution light near a bridge, Niccolò stops and gets out to investigate. Mavi calls out to Niccolò and he returns to the car. She feels they are being watched. Niccolò drives off speeding through the countryside shrouded in fog. They get into an argument about his driving and Niccolò stops the car. Mavi gets out and walks away, disappearing into the fog. Niccolò goes out looking for her, but she's nowhere to be found. He returns to the car and finds her waiting inside. Later that night they arrive at the country farmhouse, which Niccolò notes is slowing sinking into the ancient Roman ruins beneath it. They explore the ruins and disturb a large owl that flies off. That night they argue about their relationship and his inability to tell her he loves her; later they make passionate love. The next morning, Niccolò finds that Mavi has disappeared. Back in Rome he is unable to find her. Passing a newstand, Niccolò recognizes the young blonde woman on the cover of a swimming magazine from the dinner party. He goes to the public pool where he approaches her and learns that she once slept with Mavi, but hasn't seen her lately. Sometime later, Niccolò meets a beautiful actress named Ida  at a theater and drives her home. Niccolò is attracted to Ida's openness, warmth, and sincerity. After spending the night, he watches her the next morning riding a horse on the farm where she's staying. That evening Ida comes to Niccolò's home, and while they talk a floral arrangement of Japanese gardenias arrives for Mavi. Niccolò is still upset over her disappearance and her mystery suitor. The next day Niccolò notices the stooge following him and confronts him while a group of priests look on. Unfortunately, Niccolò is unable to press charges, and the stooge doesn't reveal the name of the secret suitor. In an effort to help him, Ida goes off on her own looking for Mavi, and the next day she shows up with a copy of Time magazine with Mavi's picture in an article titled ""Europe's Woman Today"". Niccolò suspects that her father is behind the threats. He tracks down Mavi's address through the publisher and waits at the apartment. That night he sees her entering a woman's apartment and listens as they talk about hiding from him. Mavi watches from her window as Niccolò walks off into the night. Sometime later, Niccolò takes Ida to Venice to an open lagoon just outside the islands. As they drift through the solitary seascape, Ida observes, ""It's very beautiful, but sad."" Niccolò asks her to marry him and they embrace. Later they return to their hotel on the Grand Canal where Ida receives a phone call from her doctor notifying her that she is pregnant—apparently with someone else's child. Although she tells Niccolò, ""You're my love,"" she knows she will return to the father of her baby. Niccolò looks out at the seagulls flying over the canal. Back in Rome Niccolò sits on his windowsill looking up at the sun through a pair of sunglasses. He closes his eyes and imagines a science fiction film about a spaceship moving toward the sun. He recalls telling his nephew about space travel, saying, ""The day mankind understands what the sun is made of and its power, perhaps we'll understand the entire universe and the reasons behind so many things."" His nephew responds, ""And then?"""

As it grows closer to midnight  on David's 21st birthday, Sarah, Matt, and David, with the help of a local psychic's niece named Yolanda Lopez , uncover a ritual that may save David's life. At midnight, they begin the ritual, and when Matt and Sarah return to Mrs. Shaw's house, they find out that Mrs. Shaw is the person who was possessed by the spirit of Ben Woods. The two teens race back to the Bakers' home, with Mrs. Shaw/Ben in close pursuit. Just as the possessed woman is about to kill David, Justin van Kamp appears, and it is revealed that he is actually the reincarnation of Ben's son, Johnny. Johnny convinces his father not to kill David, and Ben's spirit moves on. Later that day, Sarah returns home to San Diego, saying that this adventure was only the beginning of strange occurrences in Pine Valley, hinting at a possible sequel.

Meanwhile back in the forest, the mother Panda steps into a bear trap as her newborn cub who is rare and priceless looks on helplessly. Back at the reserve, Michael and the staff recognize the weakness of the signal and lack of movement in the collar, which leads them to believing the panda is in danger. Just as Michael, Ling and Chu set out to visit the panda, Ryan arrives at the reserve but Michael is in a hurry, shows Ryan to his room, and forbids him to come with him into the forest. Ryan watches his dad leave, and with disgust, runs out after his father's tractor, scolding him for leaving him so fast. Michael claims he would be back as soon as he could and Ryan replies saying that is what he had said two years ago when he and his mother divorced and she left. This causes Michael to stop the tractor, and realizing his mistake, lets Ryan come for the mission. While they are on their way to the panda and her cub, two poachers, who had set up the trap, beat the others to them. The poacher with the gun fires at the mother panda, but the other poacher pushes the gun away, stating in Chinese that he takes the cub first and then he can shoot the mother. Meanwhile Michael, Ryan, Ling, and Chu all hear this gunshot, and Michael sets out into the forest with the blow gun. He catches the poacher ready to shoot the mother panda, shouts ""NO! DON'T SHOOT!"" and sprints through the bushes toward the poacher. The poacher, terrified, blindly shoots at Michael's ankle, knocking him down, and runs away with the other poacher and the cub. Ryan, Ling, and Chu run over, and see Michael down and wounded in the ankle. While Chu and Michael set the mother panda loose from the trap, Ling runs back to the tractor and radios the helicopter from the reserve to bring the cub and the injured Michael back to the reserve. When the helicopter arrives, the pilot Chang states there is only room for Michael, the panda, and himself, and Ryan would have to wait at the site for Chang to come back to pick him up. While Ling and Chu set off to find the stolen cub, Ryan is waiting at the rock, muttering to himself to keep entertained. When he sees a snake in the bush, he immediately takes off through the trees, frightened, and in search of Ling. Ryan encounters Ling and Chu, and together they set out to the poachers' home to recover the cub. The poachers, having discovered the panda was missing, catch Ryan and Ling escaping on the bridge, and shoot the bridge in order to stop them. This causes Ling to fall, just barely hanging on, leaving Ryan to try and help her up. As the poachers approach, the cub pushes both of them in, thus all 3 of them landing in the river to float downstream. Later when they tried to return the panda to the reserve, they fell into a river and down a waterfall. When they surface and get out of the water, Ryan and Ling find themselves covered with leeches so they frantically strip off their clothes and jump into the river. Ryan soon realizes that he can use the batteries in his watch to power the collar and enable his father to locate them. Attempting to make their way back to the reserve with the cub, whom Ryan decides to name Johnny, they come upon a local village that grants them hospitality for protecting Johnny. However, the poachers have also arrived and begin searching the village for Johnny. The villagers help the trio escape, but as they make their way across the mountains, the poachers follow and attempt to take Johnny. Luckily, Michael arrives and subdues the poachers. They then drive back to the reserve just as Chinese officials are about to close it. Upon seeing Ryan bring Johnny back to his mother, the officials decide let the reserve remain open."

While Ling and Chu set off to find the stolen cub, Ryan is waiting at the rock, muttering to himself to keep entertained. When he sees a snake in the bush, he immediately takes off through the trees, frightened, and in search of Ling. Ryan encounters Ling and Chu, and together they set out to the poachers' home to recover the cub. The poachers, having discovered the panda was missing, catch Ryan and Ling escaping on the bridge, and shoot the bridge in order to stop them. This causes Ling to fall, just barely hanging on, leaving Ryan to try and help her up. As the poachers approach, the cub pushes both of them in, thus all 3 of them landing in the river to float downstream. Later when they tried to return the panda to the reserve, they fell into a river and down a waterfall. When they surface and get out of the water, Ryan and Ling find themselves covered with leeches so they frantically strip off their clothes and jump into the river. Ryan soon realizes that he can use the batteries in his watch to power the collar and enable his father to locate them. Attempting to make their way back to the reserve with the cub, whom Ryan decides to name Johnny, they come upon a local village that grants them hospitality for protecting Johnny. However, the poachers have also arrived and begin searching the village for Johnny. The villagers help the trio escape, but as they make their way across the mountains, the poachers follow and attempt to take Johnny. Luckily, Michael arrives and subdues the poachers. They then drive back to the reserve just as Chinese officials are about to close it. Upon seeing Ryan bring Johnny back to his mother, the officials decide let the reserve remain open."

Despite Blake's success as a writer, poet, and critic, his father - a rural general practitioner - never accepted his decision to pursue a literary career nor was he willing to acknowledge his achievements in his field. Bullying, blustery, and boorish, Arthur blunders his way through fatherhood, regularly calling his son a fathead and intruding into the boy's private moments with a sense of entitlement. He has a penchant for exaggeration when he's not telling outright lies, and he publicly humiliates his long-suffering but passively complacent wife Kim with his shameless flirting with various women and an affair with Beaty, a friend of the family. At other times, he seems genuinely interested in bonding with his son, taking him camping so they can test supposedly waterproof sleeping bags he has made or allowing him to drive in the family's Alvis convertible on a wide expanse of deserted beach with reckless abandon. As a result, Blake is left with mixed feelings for the man, ranging from deeply-rooted anger to compassionate acceptance. Only after Arthur's death is he able to set aside his resentment and recognize him as a father whose flaws ultimately helped mold his son into the better man he is.

He produces a needle from his pocket and administers its contents to his assailant. She falls to the ground, apparently dead. The scene shifts to the coroner’s inquest into the death of Paula Dupree , allegedly at the hands of Dr. Carl Fletcher . Induced to reluctantly tell his story by the coroner  and district attorney , Flether admits that he killed Paula. Yet, he also offers that there is more to the tale than what is on the surface. Via flashbacks, it is learned that Fletcher was present on the opening night of the Whipple Circus and witnessed Cheela the Gorilla's heroic act that saved the life of Fred Mason . After her supposed demise, the doctor acquires the body of the beast. He detects a heartbeat, and revives the animal. Fascinated by the creature, he purchases the late Dr. Walters’ estate, hoping to find the records of his experiments. Apparently having no need of more glandular material or another brain, Cheela returns to human form. She is at first unable to speak and Fletcher diagnoses her condition as being due to shock. However, upon the arrival of his daughter Joan  and her fiancée Bob Whitney , the girl suddenly becomes verbal identifying herself as Paula. Enamored with Bob, Paula’s jealous streak resurfaces. During a moonlight canoe ride, an unseen attacker capsizes Joan and Bob. Discussing the episode with Dr. Fletcher, they believe that one of the other patients Willie  is responsible. Unbeknownst to them, Willie has already paid the supreme price for his constant harassment of Paula. Later, meeting with Bob in private, Paula shows him bruises on her shoulder, injuries she claims were inflicted by Dr. Fletcher. Meanwhile, the caretaker for the estate has made the doctor aware of the vicious killing of his dog and a flock of chickens. Armed with the broken lock to the henhouse, Dr. Fletcher confiscates Paula’s perfume bottle as well. After he returns to his study, Paula makes an attempt on his life. Just as he pushes her to the floor, Bob enters the room. Misunderstanding what he has seen, he takes Paula to another doctor for an examination. Dr. Fletcher has the lock and perfume bottle analyzed by a fingerprint expert, learning that although different in size, the prints do indeed match. He is now convinced that Paula and Cheela are one and the same. Bob has Paula examined by Dr. Meredith , who does detect mental instability and extreme physical strength. When told she is already under the care of a doctor, he admonishes the young man to return her at once to her attending physician. Arriving back at Crestview, Dr. Fletcher is met with the news that Willie’s mangled body has been found. He confides in Joan what he knows about Paula, and expresses his concern for Bob. Paula and Bob return as well, and the latter finally tells her that he is going to marry Joan, which visibly angers her. Joan rushes to meet him as Paula disappears in the shadows. Learning the truth about the girl, he sends his fiancée to her cabin while he goes to the aid Dr. Fletcher. After a search of Paula’s room fails, Dr. Fletcher tells Bob to check the rest of the house. Brandishing a hypodermic needle filled with a sedative, the physician heads outside to continue his search. Paula pursues Joan through the woods to the cottage. Attempting to gain entrance, she hears the approaching Dr. Fletcher. She attacks him, and in the struggle, he accidentally administers a fatal overdose. The flashbacks conclude and the D.A. expresses his disbelief. The Coroner parades the group, including the jury, to the morgue to re-examine the body of Paula Dupree. She is found to have reverted in death to the form of a half-human, half-ape monster. Dr. Fletcher is exonerated.

He produces a needle from his pocket and administers its contents to his assailant. She falls to the ground, apparently dead. The scene shifts to the coroner’s inquest into the death of Paula Dupree , allegedly at the hands of Dr. Carl Fletcher . Induced to reluctantly tell his story by the coroner  and district attorney , Flether admits that he killed Paula. Yet, he also offers that there is more to the tale than what is on the surface. Via flashbacks, it is learned that Fletcher was present on the opening night of the Whipple Circus and witnessed Cheela the Gorilla's heroic act that saved the life of Fred Mason . After her supposed demise, the doctor acquires the body of the beast. He detects a heartbeat, and revives the animal. Fascinated by the creature, he purchases the late Dr. Walters’ estate, hoping to find the records of his experiments. Apparently having no need of more glandular material or another brain, Cheela returns to human form. She is at first unable to speak and Fletcher diagnoses her condition as being due to shock. However, upon the arrival of his daughter Joan  and her fiancée Bob Whitney , the girl suddenly becomes verbal identifying herself as Paula. Enamored with Bob, Paula’s jealous streak resurfaces. During a moonlight canoe ride, an unseen attacker capsizes Joan and Bob. Discussing the episode with Dr. Fletcher, they believe that one of the other patients Willie  is responsible. Unbeknownst to them, Willie has already paid the supreme price for his constant harassment of Paula. Later, meeting with Bob in private, Paula shows him bruises on her shoulder, injuries she claims were inflicted by Dr. Fletcher. Meanwhile, the caretaker for the estate has made the doctor aware of the vicious killing of his dog and a flock of chickens. Armed with the broken lock to the henhouse, Dr. Fletcher confiscates Paula’s perfume bottle as well. After he returns to his study, Paula makes an attempt on his life. Just as he pushes her to the floor, Bob enters the room. Misunderstanding what he has seen, he takes Paula to another doctor for an examination. Dr. Fletcher has the lock and perfume bottle analyzed by a fingerprint expert, learning that although different in size, the prints do indeed match. He is now convinced that Paula and Cheela are one and the same. Bob has Paula examined by Dr. Meredith , who does detect mental instability and extreme physical strength. When told she is already under the care of a doctor, he admonishes the young man to return her at once to her attending physician. Arriving back at Crestview, Dr. Fletcher is met with the news that Willie’s mangled body has been found. He confides in Joan what he knows about Paula, and expresses his concern for Bob. Paula and Bob return as well, and the latter finally tells her that he is going to marry Joan, which visibly angers her. Joan rushes to meet him as Paula disappears in the shadows. Learning the truth about the girl, he sends his fiancée to her cabin while he goes to the aid Dr. Fletcher. After a search of Paula’s room fails, Dr. Fletcher tells Bob to check the rest of the house.

Two young twins from the tribe, Kutchek and Gore, bite off two of Kadar's fingers. In retaliation, Kadar has them taken prisoner as well, but agrees to spare their lives if Canary becomes his bride. Kutchek and Gore are separated and work as slaves for several years, and grow up as amazingly strong adults. Once they have become of age, Kadar sets them up to fight each other to the death in the arena, their faces masked by metal helmets. But as they struggle, Gore knocks open Kutchek's helmet, revealing his face; after recognizing each other, and after seeing Canary as a prisoner by Kadar's side, the twins escape from Kadar's fortress.

Surfers compete in a “Battle of the Bands” charity event benefiting Little Kids Rock, a nonprofit organization that provides free instruments and lessons to kids in low-income cities. Rosalina starts to fall for the L.A. Surfers lead singer, Bobby Love . Nat and Alex learned his false intentions while in the bathroom as Nat is trying to wash out the orange hair dye that he put on as part of his latte-drinking bad boy image that he attempts to pull off to impress Rosalina. Nat did this after seeing a picture of Bobby Love and worrying whether she prefers bad boys. Nat then says he will try to get along with Bobby, but as he enters Nat and Alex hide in a stall. It turns out that Bobby is just hitting on Rosalina to get to the Naked Brothers Band, and is lying about everything . Bobby even tells Matt Pinfield that Nat doesn't write his own songs, but he says that he didn't. Nat wants Bobby to confess about his lies and he won't. At the concert for Little Kid's Rock, Nat asks Bobby to confess once again, and he doesn't, and he continues to hit on Rosalina and call Nat ""Nate"" which angers Nat, and Alex stands up to Bobby and steps on his foot, causing a huge fight. During that fight, Nat declares that the benefit concert is now a battle of the bands, and whoever loses has to give all of their profits from their next CD to the charity. Cooper and the band apologize for their bad behavior, and Cooper apologizes on his own behalf because he had a dentist appointment to get head gear, and couldn't have stopped the fight before it started. Cooper asks the representative of Little Kids Rock, Patty Scoggins , if a “huge band in Old Europe” called “The Honey Bunnies” , could be the opening act for the event. She says that she could see what she could do. They actually perform, and a European producer actually gets impressed by what they did. Bobby and his band later try to come up with new songs for the concert. Since Bobby doesn't write his own songs, this is very challenging. He comes up with mediocre songs called “My Feet Are So Nice” and “I Love My Hair”. His bandmate's girlfriend, Rita, tells him how silly the songs are, and he just continues to tell her that she's not the boss of the feet or the hair song and that she's not in the band. Later Nat fails to get Rosalina to believe the truth about Bobby, and while practicing their song for the battle, he and the band make fun of Bobby twice, and she quits, telling Nat that she ""expects more from him"". She tells Bobby that the band thinks that he's a liar and he doesn't care about the charity Bobby tries to use words of encouragement like ""Have you ever noticed that the word ""lousy"" is in the word ""jealousy""? That's because jealousy... makes you feel lousy""; Rosalina tells him that he said that to her already. Rosalina asks if he was the one who told Matt Pinfield that Nat doesn't write his own songs and what part of England is he from. Bobby is stuck, because he is not from Britain. In a moment of confusion, he said “Hogwarts,” which is in Harry Potter. Bobby quickly dismisses the problem by asking Rosalina if what she's holding is the music from the Naked Brothers Band. She said that she won't be needing it since she quit the band, and Bobby throws it in the garbage. He then attempts to kiss Rosalina, but she refused, stating that she is confused and she ran away. After Rosalina leaves, Bobby takes her sheet music out of the garbage. At the concert, Bobby talks to Nat, saying he is sorry that Rosalina left the band and she was a good kisser, and Nat lost control of himself and attacks Bobby. Nat is losing but fortunately, Alex scared Bobby away with a mere balloon that a little girl gave to him. She gave it to Alex after Bobby refused the gift and said “I hope your band kicks Bobby's band's butts!” Soon after, Bobby's band plays Nat's new song he stole from Rosalina  and she realizes Bobby is fake, and she runs over to the Naked Brothers and says that Bobby stole it from her and she should have listened. She then hugs Nat and apologizes while crying. Nat forgives her, but the rest of the band thinks that she is an idiot, but he yells at them and says not to say anything because she feels badly enough. There is a net of balloons above the stage, and Rosalina wishes that “all of the balloons were made of cement” and they would fall on Bobby Love's big, fat, phony head. Then, Alex reminds Nat that he's afraid of balloons. Rosalina pulls the rope, releasing the balloons. Balloons fall all over of Bobby's band, which causes him to panic and constantly yell in fear  for his mom and jumping on his bandmate, Pork, screaming: “I'm not playing games! They're touching my face!!” Bobby Love and his band are booed off of the stage and gather at the dressing room. He expresses his anger because the band will have to dedicate all of the money from the next CD to the charity. Rita says that after this performance there won't be a next CD. Bobby Love hides his face in his hands in defeat and depression. Cooper and Patty show the Naked Brothers Band music video “L.A.” that Nat originally wrote on a screen in the wall. Seeing this, Matt Pinfield, who previously supported the L.A. Surfers, gives an explanation of what just happened: The L.A. surfers stole the song from the Naked Brothers and Bobby Love is really ""balloon fearing surfer dude Robert Love from California. I repeat, Bobby Love is afraid of balloons, and is from San Diego"". Meanwhile backstage, Nat instructed Rosalina on how to play his new song, ""Girl Of My Dreams"". Nat and the band come out on to the stage, and tell the audience to give a round of applause for the Honey Bunnies and the LA Surfers; nobody cheers at all. Then, Nat introduces the song, which is dedicated to a “very special person”  and notes that he wrote this when he was in pain and now that he's happy, he can actually enjoy it. The band performs the song, ""Girl Of My Dreams "" and win the battle of the bands."

They await the return of Chuanbao, the village militia Sergent, and the village elder. The twosome arrive with Chuanbao carrying the village elder on his back. The village elder explains that they were attacked by Japanese forces in the middle of a meeting and has been seriously wounded as a result. With a few parting words instructing his successor, Laozhong, to ""keep holding on"", he dies.  The movie then cuts to a fighting scene between large numbers of Japanese and Chinese forces. Against superior firepower, the main Chinese army retreats while leaving local resistance militias in place to harass the enemy. Local villagers hide in tunnels below the surface of the village in order to escape the Japanese attackers. The Japanese seem to have some familiarity with this tactic as they search for and attempt to kill the occupants of these tunnels. The attack concludes with capture of a number of villagers and a flaming village being burnt as a result of raiding by the Japanese. Some time afterward, Chuanbao and a few militia are shown discussing their next course of action against the Japanese. One of the soldiers complain about having ""too few people and too few weapons"" but Brother Gao manages to restore the confidence of his men by rallying them for an attack. However, he is stopped by a middle aged woman, Xialin, who seems to hold authority over him. She tells them to meet back in the village for a village meeting. After reading aloud a strategy/propaganda literature by Maozedong, the villagers decide to begin digging extensive tunnels beneath the village in preparation for more fighting against the Japanese. Meanwhile, the Japanese hear of these resistance plans and plan a night raid on the village. The Japanese are almost able to sneak in completely undetected, but were accidentally discovered by Laozhong while he was outside for a stroll. Laozhong is able to ring the village bell, sounding the alarm, allowing the rest of the villagers to enter into the safety of the tunnels. The Japanese raiders surround Laozhong and the Japanese General Tian Shan shoots Laozhong. Before he dies, Laozhong is able to use a grenade to kill several Japanese soldiers. The Japanese are initially unable to find anymore villager so they begin to look for the tunnels by digging into the ground. Upon finding the tunnels, they pour water, spew smoke and potentially poison gas into the tunnels. After trying to plug up the smoke and gas, the Chuanbao realizes that they can't hold out forever. In consultation with Xialin, he decides to go to the surface through a secret tunnel in order to draw away the Japanese. He secretly fires a bullet into the Shan Tian's leg, wounding him. Meanwhile, other nearby villages come to give aid by setting off fireworks which mimic the sounds of gunfire in order to intimidate the Japanese. Collaborationist Chinese Army General Binghui suggests that the Japanese retreat and Tian Shan grudgingly agrees.  Some days later, the Chuanbao is shown to be surveying the damage done to his village by the Japanese raid. Chuanbao despairs at the destruction but meets Uncle Pingyuan and is comforted by him. After conversing with Uncle Pingyuan, Chuanbao resolves to see the conflict through to the end and is advised by Pingyuan to read more of Maozedong's strategy literature. As Chuanbao reads the literature, he is inspired by a quote ""To protect yourself is to better destroy the enemy. To destroy the enemy is to better protect yourself."" He brings this concept before the rest of village and receives unanimous support. They decide to try making the tunnels into an offensive option against the Japanese soldiers instead of only using them as hiding places. Over at least one winter season, the tunnels develop defensive sophistication meant to defend against flooding, poison gas and infiltrators. Additionally, there are offensive capabilities devised in order to attack Japanese soldiers on the surface. The tunnel design is taken on by several neighboring villages. Additionally, the villagers are told that communist reinforcements are also returning to the area. The Japanese hear of this and use the opportunity to send in spies posing as the communist reinforcements in order learn more about the tunnel defenses. The impostor reinforcements plan to gather all the local resistance leaders and then capture them all by surprise. However, before they are able to initiate the plan, Chuanbao realizes their plot. He tricks some of them to split up and enter the tunnels and kills the spies one by one in the enclosed space. During this time, the real Communist forces arrive and apprehend the remaining spies. Japanese troops arrive to facilitate the capture, but are swiftly repelled by the Communist's reinforcement regiment. With all the major elements of the Chinese forces present, the Chinese forces prepare for an imminent counter attack by the Japanese. The ensuing engagement between 300 Japanese forces and local militia result in a total victory for the Chinese. Initially, the Chinese militia are overwhelmed by Japanese artillery, but the Japanese infantry take heavy casualties when trying to finally take the village and are forced to retreat.  In the aftermath of the previous victory, the militia continue expanding the tunnel network. They begin to expand outside the village and eventually reach the vicinity of the Japanese villages; all the resistance villages are also interconnected. Chuanbao makes a joke about ""undermining"" the entire Japanese base. Meanwhile, the Japanese forces have fortified and reinforced their base positions making direct assault by the Chinese forces extremely difficult. The Chinese try to draw out the dug in Japanese with a diversionary attack on a lesser defended base. However, General Shan Tian of the Japanese sees through the plot and, hoping they'll score an easy victory at the village, directly attack the militia village, The communist command realizes the Japanese plan, but is confident that the forces stationed in the village are sufficient for defense. They instead use the absence of the Japanese main force as an opportunity to assault the previously fortified Japanese base. In preparation for the inevitable Japanese retreat, the Chinese prepared troops to ambush the Japanese on the way. In the tunnels beneath the Japanese base, the Chinese militia place explosives to take out key defensive positions. With preparations complete, the primary Chinese army commences with the assault. As predicted, the Japanese main force begins to retreat upon hearing of the Chinese assault and are caught directly in the ambush in the open fields. Hundreds of armed Chinese militia are shown to be attacking the surprised Japanese forces. By the end, General Shan Tian is shown to be trapped in the remains of a Japanese defensive installation. Surrounded by Chinese forces and all alone, it is implied that the Japanese forces have been completely routed. The movie concludes with a festive celebration by the victorious Chinese.  *Village Elder Successor; Character Name: Laozhong Gao <高老忠>; Played by Bingyu Wang <王炳彧> *Communist Lieutenant; Character Name: Uncle Pingyuan Zhao<赵平原>; Played by Yongshou Zhang <张勇手> *Japanese General; Character Name: Tian Shan <山田>; Played by Xiaozhong Wang <王孝忠>"

Umar , king of Umarkot, is looking for a bride but finds none to his liking. Phog  mentions the unmatchable beauty of Marvi , a village girl from Malir whom he loves but who is engaged to a fellow villager, Khet. Umar decides to check out Marvi for himself and immediately falls under her spell. After unsuccessfully asking for her hand from her father, he resolves to abduct her. Confined in Umar's palace, Marvi stubbornly refuses to become his wife, faithful to her pledge to Khet. Turning down silks and jewelry, she longs for her people, the Marus. When Marvi seems about to surrender, having lost hope of being rescued, a wet-nurse reveals that they are milk siblings, thus ruling out any possibility of marriage between them. Umar then hands Marvi back to her people, but Khet and the Marus suspect her chastity. Upon hearing the news, Umar goes for Malir to defend Marvi's honor. Both have to undergo a trial to prove their innocence by walking through a fire holding a red-hot iron rod. Umar and Marvi come out of the pyre unhurt. In the end, Umar accepts his mistake and blesses Marvi and Khet as they finally marry.

The film follows two young migrant workers. Young innocent Dong Zi  is a pole carrier or coolie eking out a meager existence carrying heavy loads from place to place. His friend and roommate Gao Ping ([[Guo Tao  is from the same home village, but unlike Dong Zi, is older, more cynical, and has fallen into a life of petty crime. As the film begins, Gao has been cheated out of a small amount of money from a local gangster Su Wu ([[Wu Tao . Enraged, Gao drags his friend into Wuhan's underworld. Their first stop is a local bar, the Li Li Club where they go looking for Ruan Hong , a Vietnamese singer who is said to know Su Wu. After speaking with her, Gao and Dong kidnap the young woman and drag her to their apartment. Gao asks Dong to leave the room after which he proceeds to rape her, while Dong peers through a crack in the door. Soon afterwards, however, Gao and Ruan suddenly become lovers, much to Dong Zi's surprise and consternation. As Gao and Ruan continue their relationship, Dong Zi becomes sullen and seemingly jealous, though it is unclear of whom. Later Ruan and Gao appear to get in a fight as Gao Ping continues to obsess over the small amount of money he has lost. Enraged, Ruan leaves the apartment with a curious Dong Zi in tow. The two talk throughout the night and Ruan reveals that she only wants to become a professional singer, though such dreams seem out of reach. She eventually returns to the apartment, but only to leave the phone number of Su Wu. Upon finding Su Wu, Gao beats and imprisons Su in a cellar before releasing him, after Su agrees to take him to his boss. What happens next is not shown on screen, though Dong Zi narrating explains that Gao Ping somehow became caught up in a scheme with Su Wu and his boss, leading to Gao murdering an unknown person. Tensions rise, however, when it is discovered that Ruan Hong is the kept woman of Su Wu's boss. Realizing the danger, Gao Ping disappears just as the boss and the police begin to close in on him. Secretly communicating with Ruan, Gao promises to take her away but fails to show up on the appointed day. Ruan is subsequently arrested when the Li Li Club is seized as a den of prostitution. When Gao finally comes back to his apartment, he is caught by the Boss whose men beat him to death. The film then ends as Ruan, now released from prison, returns to the apartment of Dong Zi and Gao Ping. For Dong Zi, she is the only person he knows in the city. They reminisce of the dead Gao, and Ruan thanks Dong Zi for ""kidnapping"" her that night. Before she leaves, Dong Zi gives her a walkman with a tape of one of her songs."

Her only clues are a battered trunk with a broken nameplate  and a shredded flag with a white rose. Ten years later, a handsome prince named Antonio discovers Ro's island. She saves his life when crocodiles attack him and his friend Frazer. Grateful for her help, Antonio asks Ro if she would like to return with him to his kingdom, Apollonia. Hoping to discover her past, Ro agrees as long as her animal family can come. During the voyage back, Ro and Antonio begin to fall in love. When they return, Antonio introduces Ro to his parents, King Peter and Queen Danielle as well as Antonio's younger sisters; the triplets Rita, Gina and Sofia. While the little girls immediately love Ro and her animals, Danielle is unsure what to think about Ro while Peter doesn't approve of her at all. The king becomes even more disturbed by his son's obvious affection towards the ""uncivilized island girl"". Ro does, however, succeed in earning the friendship of Danielle’s pet monkey, Tallulah. Peter is determined to have his adventurous son settle down and marry. While away, he arranged for Antonio to wed Luciana, a princess from a neighboring kingdom. Like the prince, Luciana doesn't want to marry someone she doesn't love, but is forced to be a puppet in her mother’s schemes. Unknown to all, Queen Ariana  is plotting to kill Antonio's family at the wedding and overthrow their kingdom, although Luciana is not wanting to help her mother, as she is much too kind and also befriends Ro. Queen Ariana's motive is revenge for her parents, who were banished and reduced to pig farmers for the attempted murder of Antonio's parents years ago. The queen sees Ro as a threat to her plans and quickly plots to dispose of her. Over the next few days, Ro repeatedly tries to please Antonio's parents, but due to Ariana's interference, they all end in disaster, which further increases Peter's dislike of her. By now, Ro feels like she doesn't belong in Apollonia and thinks about returning to her island, but her love for Antonio and determination to find out about herself convinces her to stay. Trying to cheer her up, Ro’s animals and Tallulah help her dress for Antonio and Luciana's engagement party. Thanks to their efforts, Ro arrives in a stunning gown while her grace leaves all the guests impressed, including Peter. When Antonio confesses to Ro that he loves her, Ro reminds him of his pledge to Luciana. After a dance together, she leaves and spots a carriage outside the castle bearing the same design as the flag found back on the island. Ro discovers that the flag belongs to another neighboring kingdom called Paladia, but the duke and duchess  only had sons; no daughters. Fed up with his father's attempts to push him into marriage, Antonio writes a note for Ro, saying that he wants to run away with her instead of marrying Luciana. Tika witnesses this and decides to hide the note from Ro, fearing that Ro will leave her. As part of her plan to get rid of Ro, Ariana has her three pet rats put a deadly sleeping herb called “sunset herb” into the food of all the animals in the kingdom. The next day, animals all over the kingdom are unable to wake up, and Ro is blamed for the epidemic. Peter has Ro locked away in the dungeon, and during that time, the ""Prisoner food"" that Azul eats also contains the Sunset Herb, and he too falls into a deep sleep. When Antonio begs for her release, Peter makes his son a deal, if he marries Luciana, Ro will be freed. Ro is banished from Apollonia and placed on a boat that will take her back to her island. On the journey, Tika confesses how she hid Antonio's note, and Ro forgives her. The entire group are then thrown overboard, as Ariana had paid a man to sabotage the boat. When Ro almost drowns and Sagi attempts to call her to come near him, her memory is triggered of how she was lost at sea as a child, and of a man yelling her real name: ""Rosella"". Tika nearly succumbs to hypothermia and drowns, but Ro manages to call dolphins for help just in time, and they bring the group back to shore. As Antonio and Luciana's wedding starts, Ariana sneaks some of the sunset herb into the wedding cake. Ro arrives and quickly starts to make a rose tonic antidote for the poison. She almost completes her task when the king's guards discover her. Sagi escapes and takes the antidote to Tallulah, who has been poisoned as well. One of the guards chase after him, but Tika takes him down. The other guard is about to lead Ro back to the dungeons. Hearing about the commotion from Tika, who enters the wedding room just as it is about to start, Antonio, Luciana, Antonio's parents, Ariana and their guests hurry to the greenhouse, disrupting the wedding. Antonio is ecstatic to see Ro again, while Peter demands that she be thrown in prison for daring to return. She tries to explain the animals have really been poisoned and that she can cure them. The king is hesitant at first, but then a cured Tallulah appears with Sagi, showing that Ro is telling the truth. Ro then exposes Ariana's plot to everyone. Ariana denies it, but a shocked Luciana confirms Ro's story by saying that her mother had told her not to eat any wedding food. Exposed, Ariana tries to make a getaway in the wedding carriage, but after a long chase scene, is eventually stopped and captured by falling into the pigs' pen. Peter apologizes to Ro and his son. He gives the couple his blessing and embraces Ro. She tells the royal family that her real name is Rosella. A guest behind them, Queen Marissa from Paladia, overhears Ro and comes forward. She tells them that she had a daughter named Rosella. Ro pauses and then starts to sing a lullaby she knew since she was little. Marissa joins in to complete the song, realizing that Ro is indeed her long-lost daughter and that Rosella is princess of Paladia. Antonio, his parents and Ro's animal friends  watch as the reunited mother and daughter embrace. Ro and Antonio are promptly married. Luciana also attends the wedding and meets a handsome young prince. The happy couple  wave goodbye to everyone as they set sail on a honeymoon voyage with Sagi, Azul, Tika and Tallulah in tow."

While the little girls immediately love Ro and her animals, Danielle is unsure what to think about Ro while Peter doesn't approve of her at all. The king becomes even more disturbed by his son's obvious affection towards the ""uncivilized island girl"". Ro does, however, succeed in earning the friendship of Danielle’s pet monkey, Tallulah. Peter is determined to have his adventurous son settle down and marry. While away, he arranged for Antonio to wed Luciana, a princess from a neighboring kingdom. Like the prince, Luciana doesn't want to marry someone she doesn't love, but is forced to be a puppet in her mother’s schemes. Unknown to all, Queen Ariana  is plotting to kill Antonio's family at the wedding and overthrow their kingdom, although Luciana is not wanting to help her mother, as she is much too kind and also befriends Ro. Queen Ariana's motive is revenge for her parents, who were banished and reduced to pig farmers for the attempted murder of Antonio's parents years ago. The queen sees Ro as a threat to her plans and quickly plots to dispose of her. Over the next few days, Ro repeatedly tries to please Antonio's parents, but due to Ariana's interference, they all end in disaster, which further increases Peter's dislike of her. By now, Ro feels like she doesn't belong in Apollonia and thinks about returning to her island, but her love for Antonio and determination to find out about herself convinces her to stay. Trying to cheer her up, Ro’s animals and Tallulah help her dress for Antonio and Luciana's engagement party. Thanks to their efforts, Ro arrives in a stunning gown while her grace leaves all the guests impressed, including Peter. When Antonio confesses to Ro that he loves her, Ro reminds him of his pledge to Luciana. After a dance together, she leaves and spots a carriage outside the castle bearing the same design as the flag found back on the island. Ro discovers that the flag belongs to another neighboring kingdom called Paladia, but the duke and duchess  only had sons; no daughters. Fed up with his father's attempts to push him into marriage, Antonio writes a note for Ro, saying that he wants to run away with her instead of marrying Luciana. Tika witnesses this and decides to hide the note from Ro, fearing that Ro will leave her. As part of her plan to get rid of Ro, Ariana has her three pet rats put a deadly sleeping herb called “sunset herb” into the food of all the animals in the kingdom. The next day, animals all over the kingdom are unable to wake up, and Ro is blamed for the epidemic. Peter has Ro locked away in the dungeon, and during that time, the ""Prisoner food"" that Azul eats also contains the Sunset Herb, and he too falls into a deep sleep. When Antonio begs for her release, Peter makes his son a deal, if he marries Luciana, Ro will be freed. Ro is banished from Apollonia and placed on a boat that will take her back to her island. On the journey, Tika confesses how she hid Antonio's note, and Ro forgives her. The entire group are then thrown overboard, as Ariana had paid a man to sabotage the boat. When Ro almost drowns and Sagi attempts to call her to come near him, her memory is triggered of how she was lost at sea as a child, and of a man yelling her real name: ""Rosella"". Tika nearly succumbs to hypothermia and drowns, but Ro manages to call dolphins for help just in time, and they bring the group back to shore. As Antonio and Luciana's wedding starts, Ariana sneaks some of the sunset herb into the wedding cake. Ro arrives and quickly starts to make a rose tonic antidote for the poison. She almost completes her task when the king's guards discover her. Sagi escapes and takes the antidote to Tallulah, who has been poisoned as well. One of the guards chase after him, but Tika takes him down. The other guard is about to lead Ro back to the dungeons. Hearing about the commotion from Tika, who enters the wedding room just as it is about to start, Antonio, Luciana, Antonio's parents, Ariana and their guests hurry to the greenhouse, disrupting the wedding. Antonio is ecstatic to see Ro again, while Peter demands that she be thrown in prison for daring to return. She tries to explain the animals have really been poisoned and that she can cure them. The king is hesitant at first, but then a cured Tallulah appears with Sagi, showing that Ro is telling the truth. Ro then exposes Ariana's plot to everyone. Ariana denies it, but a shocked Luciana confirms Ro's story by saying that her mother had told her not to eat any wedding food. Exposed, Ariana tries to make a getaway in the wedding carriage, but after a long chase scene, is eventually stopped and captured by falling into the pigs' pen. Peter apologizes to Ro and his son. He gives the couple his blessing and embraces Ro. She tells the royal family that her real name is Rosella. A guest behind them, Queen Marissa from Paladia, overhears Ro and comes forward. She tells them that she had a daughter named Rosella. Ro pauses and then starts to sing a lullaby she knew since she was little. Marissa joins in to complete the song, realizing that Ro is indeed her long-lost daughter and that Rosella is princess of Paladia. Antonio, his parents and Ro's animal friends  watch as the reunited mother and daughter embrace. Ro and Antonio are promptly married. Luciana also attends the wedding and meets a handsome young prince. The happy couple  wave goodbye to everyone as they set sail on a honeymoon voyage with Sagi, Azul, Tika and Tallulah in tow."

The movie follows various children and teachers at school and at home showing the viewers among other things, that 1) Someone has drawn Kuchisake onna pictures on a blackboard, 2) Three boys go to a park where the Kuchisake onna apparently likes to show up at 5 pm, hoping to catch sight of her and 3) A young student Mika does not have the best home life as her mother tells her she hopes the Kuchisake onna gets her, before she proceeds to smack Mika around. A teacher goes to the backboard to erase the Kuchisake onna pictures and hears “Am I pretty?” An earthquake then breaks out and a dead woman comes out of the closet. The earthquake ends and we go back to the boys in the park. It’s 5 pm and Kuchisake onna shows up with a huge pair of scissors, grabs one of the boys and disappears. The next day, rumors are really flying as the news is reporting a boy was kidnapped by a woman dressed as Kuchisake onna. After school the teachers walk students to where their parents can pick them up as a safety measure but Mika doesn't want to go home with her mom. Mika's teacher Kyoko agrees to stay with her and goes on a walk with her, asking if she had a fight with her mom and offering to help them make up. Mika reveals her mom’s been beating her by showing Kyoko her bruises. Kyoko tries to defend Mika's abusive mother and gets upset, screaming at Mika when Mika says she “hates her mother.” Mika runs off with Kyoko following, and the Kuchisake onna shows up and grabs Mika. She struggles, knocking off the Kuchisake onna's mask and revealing her hideously disfigured face. Then the Kuchisake onna walks off with Mika, right past Kyoko who is too terrified to even try and save her student. Later after the police have been called and don't believe Kyoko's claim that the kidnapper really is the Kuchisake onna, Kyoko goes home and calls her ex husband, asking to speak with their daughter. He lies saying the little girl is asleep. We find out Kyoko herself is an abusive mom as we see her in a flash back, accusing her little girl of loving her father more and the daughter answering that she does, “because she hates her mommy for hitting her,” to which Kyoko hits her. Kyoko is approached by the teacher, Noboru, who erased the Kuchisake onna picture earlier and heard “Am I pretty?” He shows Kyoko a picture of a woman who looks just like the Kuchisake onna only without the disfigurement, and Kyoko demands that they go to the police with the picture. Noboru tells her it wouldn't help – that the picture is 30 years old – and that he heard the Kuchisake onna voice when the unnamed boy and Mika were attacked, and is going to follow the voice when he hears it again to try and prevent another kidnapping. Hearing this, Kyoko demands to go with him. Kyoko and Noboru do manage to save a boy from the Kuchisake onna and then Kyoko stabs her repeatedly, only to learn that the she possess innocent people to interact with the living, and they have just killed a poor house wife and mother of two girls the Kuchisake onna was possessing. Leaving the Kuchisake onna free to take another host. Noboru eventually reveals to Kyoko that the Kuchisake onna is the spirit of his mother and that she was abusive to him and his siblings. They then follow clues they’ve gathered from the gossip the children of the area are spreading about the Kuchisake onna until they manage to find where the Kuchisake onna is keeping Mika which is Noboru's childhood home. As they walk into the house, Noboru sees a knife on the floor, and we learn through a flashback that Noboru's mother was bipolar, one minute sweet and the next crazy, and that she begs Noboru to ""Aim at my neck"", or next time she goes crazy she might kill him. Noboru slits her mouth when she becomes crazy instead and stabs her in the stomach. Looking down at his dead and horryifying looking mother, young Noboru puts a surgical mask over her slit mouth and a long coat over her stab wound, then hides her in a closet. Noboru then looks inside the closet to see a big hole, which leads to a cellar where Mika, and all the other victims, were being held. They then have a big final battle at that includes Mika's mother who's also Kuchisake onna. Kyoko and Mika make it out alive, but Noboru dies by Kuchisake onna.

The movie follows various children and teachers at school and at home showing the viewers among other things, that 1) Someone has drawn Kuchisake onna pictures on a blackboard, 2) Three boys go to a park where the Kuchisake onna apparently likes to show up at 5 pm, hoping to catch sight of her and 3) A young student Mika does not have the best home life as her mother tells her she hopes the Kuchisake onna gets her, before she proceeds to smack Mika around. A teacher goes to the backboard to erase the Kuchisake onna pictures and hears “Am I pretty?” An earthquake then breaks out and a dead woman comes out of the closet. The earthquake ends and we go back to the boys in the park. It’s 5 pm and Kuchisake onna shows up with a huge pair of scissors, grabs one of the boys and disappears. The next day, rumors are really flying as the news is reporting a boy was kidnapped by a woman dressed as Kuchisake onna. After school the teachers walk students to where their parents can pick them up as a safety measure but Mika doesn't want to go home with her mom. Mika's teacher Kyoko agrees to stay with her and goes on a walk with her, asking if she had a fight with her mom and offering to help them make up. Mika reveals her mom’s been beating her by showing Kyoko her bruises. Kyoko tries to defend Mika's abusive mother and gets upset, screaming at Mika when Mika says she “hates her mother.” Mika runs off with Kyoko following, and the Kuchisake onna shows up and grabs Mika. She struggles, knocking off the Kuchisake onna's mask and revealing her hideously disfigured face. Then the Kuchisake onna walks off with Mika, right past Kyoko who is too terrified to even try and save her student. Later after the police have been called and don't believe Kyoko's claim that the kidnapper really is the Kuchisake onna, Kyoko goes home and calls her ex husband, asking to speak with their daughter. He lies saying the little girl is asleep. We find out Kyoko herself is an abusive mom as we see her in a flash back, accusing her little girl of loving her father more and the daughter answering that she does, “because she hates her mommy for hitting her,” to which Kyoko hits her.

The movie starts by showing what Maggie goes through every day at school. We discover that her best friend Casey  is not as unpopular as Maggie due to her relationship with one of the popular guys. Casey is invited to a party by the boy and accepts the invite on the premise that Maggie is allowed to come as well. The popular boys cringe but don't say anything. At the party Casey is dragged away by her sort of boyfriend, leaving Maggie alone to be laughed at by the preppy clique, including Liz , a very hated but feared girl at school. Maggie gets food down the front of her shirt and retreats to the kitchen to clean it off . From the kitchen she can see Casey and her boyfriend making out in the adjacent hallway before her friend Louis  greets her. It is clear that Louis has a thing for Maggie and vice-versa. Louis leaves and Casey appears at the same time as Tara  the sweet Queen Bee at school to wipe food off her shirt as well. Tara asks if Maggie is as klutzy as she is which Maggie confirms that she is, saying ""No, my blouse was just hungry."" After she leaves Casey makes a remark about how Tara is only nice so she can win Homecoming Queen to which Maggie replies that it would be nice if she herself were to win Homecoming Queen and not somebody like Tara or her friends. Liz overhears and decides to nominate Maggie as a joke. The joke is on her though as many students get excited about Maggie being the queen, including Tara, who is, of course, nominated herself. Maggie easily collects 150 signatures to put her on the ballot  and becomes an official nominee. Maggie starts campaigning but gets upset one day when she sees Tara's posters out in the hallway and imagines her mom praising Tara's thinness and beauty. She runs home to find comfort food. Meanwhile, Liz vandalizes Tara's posters so the principal will think it's Maggie and take her out of the race. The plan does not work and Tara begins to suspect that her best friend is trying to sabotage Maggie. At voting time, Maggie wins Homecoming Queen, and the popular clique is shocked and rudely sit and glare at Maggie, but Tara looks genuinely happy for the plus-sized beauty queen. It is later revealed that Tara voted for Maggie and not herself. Maggie is bombarded with offers from the press who wish to discuss the experience with her. However, the popular kids are not ready to accept Maggie's win without a fight and plan to get her to resign. Tara's boyfriend Trip  and Liz plot to ruin Maggie's homecoming float. When Maggie sits on it the float busts, making it look like Maggie's weight broke it. Tara is outraged and breaks up with Trip. She also discovers that Liz only hangs out with her because she's popular and ends their friendship. The other popular girls stop speaking to Liz as well. Maggie goes on television to discuss her win but comes off sounding rude and ungrateful towards her friends and supporters. She has also been ignoring Casey who has been trying to ask Maggie for advice on whether or not she should consummate her relationship with her now boyfriend. Angry, Casey spews out some harsh insults and Maggie shoves her into a row of bikes, getting herself suspended. Maggie has alienated from her friends and no longer wishes to be Homecoming Queen although the school tells her she can. Maggie realizes that she plays the victim and that her harshest critic is herself. She decides to go through being Homecoming Queen even though the reception will most likely be bad and asks Louis to be her King. She reconciles with both her mom and Casey who eagerly cheer her on at the game. Although many people boo her a lot of people cheer for her too. Maggie realizes that she not only won Homecoming Queen but she changed herself as well."

Among them is François Laurin, a man of jealous and violent temperament, who is married to Édith, the daughter of an upright veteran soldier Maria Lazare. François suspects, correctly, that Édith is conducting an affair with the poet Jean Diaz who lives in the village with his mother, and he sends Édith to stay with his parents in Lorraine - where she is subsequently captured and raped by German soldiers. François and Jean find themselves serving in the same battalion at the front, where the initial tensions between them give way to a close friendship which acknowledges that they both love Édith. In 1918 Jean is discharged through ill-health and returns to the village, to find his mother dying. Édith reappears from captivity, now with a young half-German daughter Angèle. Her father, Maria Lazare, immediately leaves to avenge the shame to the family name. When François comes home on leave, Jean and Édith fear his reaction to the illegitimate child and try to conceal her from him, which merely revives his jealous suspicions of Jean, and the two men fight. When the truth is revealed, François and Jean agree to seek their vengeance in battle and both return to the front. In a great battle, in which a mythical figure of Le Gaulois leads on the French forces, François is wounded and dies in the field hospital. Jean, meanwhile, is so shell-shocked that he becomes insane. He returns to the village and gathers the inhabitants together to tell them of his vision on the battlefield: from the graves of the dead, soldiers arise and gather in a great cohort that marches through the land, back to their homes. Jean challenges the villagers to say whether they have been worthy of the men's sacrifices, and they watch in horror as their dead family and friends appear on the threshold. The soldiers return to their rest, and Jean goes back to his mother's house. There he finds a book of his own poems which he tears up in disgust, until one of them, his Ode to the Sun, drives him to denounce the sun for its complicity in the crimes of war. As the sunlight fades from the room, Jean dies.

While not doing their work, they hear a recording session as Alice Van Doren  sings ""Voices of Spring"". She is recording this song under a pseudonym  to audition for a radio show, an endeavor to which her father  objects. Impressed by the operatic virtuosity of this stunningly beautiful soprano, Curly lip syncs, as the other stooges adorn him as a woman. Curly  is ""heard"" by the radio host Mrs. Bixby . Moe dubs Curly ""Señorita Cucaracha,"" and the trio are hired to sing professionally on the radio, but must also appear at the home of the radio show’s sponsor for a party. Before they leave the studio, they have a run-in with an Italian baritone singer/violinist , and end up destroying his glasses and violin before the encounter is over. Little do the Stooges know the irate singer/violinist is also slated to perform at Mrs. Bixby's home that evening. After sabotaging the baritone's vocal performance by tossing cherries into his mouth as he croons, the trio get ready for Curly to ""perform."" Moe's idea is to play ""Voices of Spring"" on the nearby, out-of-view phonograph while Curly mimes the words, just as he did convincingly at the recording studio. All is well at the party until Moe angrily breaks the record over Curly’s head, leaving the trio with no song. Larry spots a collection of records, hastily selects the ""Lucia Sextet,"" and announces it as the ""Sextet by Lucy"". This song, however, requires pantomime by all three. This works well until the baritone recognizes them, and unplugs the phonograph midway through the ""Lucia Sextet"", leaving the trio groaning out loud. To prevent Curly from having to sing, Moe ""concludes"" that the Señorita has lost her voice.  Alice Van Doran is also present at the party, and catches onto the boys' scheme. To help them out of their jam, she hides behind a curtain and sings ""Voices of Spring"" live as Curly again mimics his way through. This works well until the baritone, wondering how Curly is ""singing"" without the aid of the phonograph, discovers Alice behind the curtain. The baritone quickly yanks off Curly's wig, and reveals the trio as a bunch of fakes. Alice's father, however, sees that his daughter has genuine talent, and decides she should indeed pursue her singing career. As for the Stooges, they are pelted with records and make a quick exit from the party."

A veteran of the Third Crusade and Richard's war against Phillip II of France, he now takes part in the siege against Chalus Castle. Disillusioned and war-weary, he believes the King when he invites him to give an honest view of the war and the King's conduct. After Robin gives a frank but unflattering appraisal, Richard breaks his promise and has Robin and comrades taken prisoner to be judged after ending the siege. The betrayed men decide to free themselves and desert. Following Richard's death, Robin and two other common archers, Allan A'Dayle , Will Scarlett , as well as soldier Little John , attempt to secretly return to their homeland after fighting abroad for the past 10 years. Along the way they come across an ambush of the Royal guard by Sir Godfrey , an English knight collaborating with the French. Philip II had ordered Sir Godfrey to assassinate Richard. Having discovered the King is already slain, Sir Godfrey is chased off by the arrival of Robin and his companions. Aiming to return to England safely and richer in pocket than when they left it, Robin and his men steal the armour of the slain knights and, under the guise of noblemen, head for the English ships on the coast. Before leaving the scene of slaughter, Robin promises one of the dying knights, Robert Loxley , to return a sword to the knight's father in Nottingham. Upon arriving in England, Robin  is brought to London and chosen to inform the Royal family of the King's death. He witnesses the coronation of King John , the younger brother of Richard. John orders harsh taxes to be collected, sending Sir Godfrey off to the North to do so. He has no idea that Godfrey is a French agent who, using French troops, will use this Royal Decree to stir up enough unrest to cause civil war in England. Robin and his companions head to Nottingham, where Loxley's elderly, blind father Sir Walter  asks him to continue impersonating his son, in order to prevent the family lands being taken by the crown. Loxley's widow, Lady Marian , is initially distrustful of Robin, but soon warms to him when he recovers taxed grain for the townsfolk to plant. Meanwhile, Godfrey's actions have stirred up the northern barons, who march to meet King John and demand the signing of a charter of rights. Having realized Godfrey's deception, and knowing he must reunite his people in order to meet an imminent French invasion, the King agrees. A battle follows in which Robin and the northern barons attack Godfrey's men while the latter are ransacking Nottingham—but not before Godfrey has slain the blind Sir Walter. The film climaxes with a French invasion on England's Cliffs of Dover, opposed by an English army. In the midst of the chaos, Marian attempts to kill Godfrey but he gains the upper hand over her and prepares to kill her. However, Robin intervenes and duels Godfrey himself. The English are victorious and Godfrey attempts to flee on horseback, but Robin shoots an arrow, from long distance, which pierces straight through Godfrey's neck. When King John sees the French surrendering to Robin rather than to himself, he senses a major threat to his power. Therefore, in the final scenes, King John not only reneges on his promise to sign the Charter of the Forest, but also declares Robin to be an outlaw. In response to this, Robin moves to Sherwood Forest with Lady Marian and his friends to form what will become the Merry Men of Sherwood Forest. ""So,"" as the concluding scroll says, ""the legend begins."""

The narration is divided into three phases. The pre-Independence period, depicting Kamarajs childhood, the influence of Satyamurthy, Kamarajs growth as a politician and his prison life. The second phase depicts his taking over as the Congress Chief Minister of the state, the reforms he tries to bring in, especially in education, his largesse and his bending the rules for a good cause-like for the urgent eye-operation of a kid. It also displayed his sense of humour , his refusal to take advantage of his position . The third phase where he puts forth the Kamaraj Plan, resigns from the post of CM, involves himself in party work; his influence on national politics, his emergence as a kingmaker and finally his disillusionment with the emerging non-ethics in political life. The closing scene , show swarms of humanity mourning the death of their beloved leader. Richard Madhuram fits well in the role, his resemblance to Kamaraj helping him, the guidance of the director aiding him to give a controlled and a subtle performance.

He loves his wife Joanna, but she is very resentful to him most of the time, they have been trying unsuccessfully to have a baby. Clint's best friend is Sheriff Sam Eberly and every now and then they spend the night fishing in the lake. Unknown to Clint, Joanna has been having an affair with the local doctor Cortland van Owen. The lovers plot to kill Clint and sell his company and his house, then move to Beverly Hills to buy a clinic. Cortland gives poison to Joanna, which is taken from a rare poisonous tropical fish. She is hesitant at first to go along with the idea but changes her mind; when they are having dinner she spikes Clint's wine with the poison. Clint has a heart attack and dies. When the coroner asks if an autopsy should be done, Cort refuses. While Clint is at the morgue he shows signs of life and just before he is to be embalmed, Joanna gives him a quick and cheap funeral instead, skipping the embalming process. Clint is put in a cheap water-damaged coffin, varnished to look like new. After his funeral, Joanna and Cortland celebrate. During a stormy night, Clint, who has surprisingly survived the dosage, wakes up buried alive, and succeeds in escaping his grave. He goes to his house and finds the truth about his wife and the doctor. He hides himself downstairs in the basement to recuperate. The next morning, Joanna meets with a lawyer to discuss about selling his business for $1,500,000. Clint wakes up and plans to kill Joanna but when Cortland comes by to pay a visit he overhears that Joanna was pregnant and Cortland had conducted an abortion of his child behind his back, Clint changes his mind about shooting Joanna, believing it to be too easy, and after he cleans himself up and tends to his wounds, he plots a dark revenge against Joanna and Cortland. The next morning, after Joanna has sold Clint's business and collected the money, Sam discovers that Clint's grave is exhumed. After further examining the coffin he believes that Clint could still be alive. Joanna goes into her bathroom and finds it covered with mud. She suspects that someone has been in her house. She frantically calls Cortland and is startled by their dog, Duke, whom she chased away earlier. Just as she's about to shoot the dog, Clint, disguised in a welding helmet and armor appears out of nowhere and she falls in the basement, knocking herself unconscious whilst Clint locks her inside and boards up the windows. Meanwhile at his apartment, Cortland is gathering some fish poison, putting it in a syringe and leaves. He arrives to see and secretly inject Joanna, where finds the money lying on the bed. Cortland enters the basement, which is now open, as he searches for Joanna, who has now regained consciousness. Believing he might be the masked figure, she hits him in the head, causing him to drop his syringe which rolls out of view. She then takes the money and tries to escape but Clint locks them both inside. As Cortland regains consciousness, Joanna realizes her mistake, where he argues about wanting to burn the money to prove he truly loves her. As they both try to find a way to escape, Clint has replaced all the shotgun bullets with blanks and Duke is guarding the basement windows, making it impossible for them to leave the basement. In the meantime, Clint is knocking out some walls and moving furniture. As time passes, Cortland suspects that Sam may be behind everything, whilst he is waiting for the figure to release them. Joanna finds the syringe filled with the fish poison and figures out that he was going to kill her and take clinic for himself. Cortland reveals that there never was a clinic and that he was going to take the money and move to the tropics so he can live the good life. As a result, they fight and just as Cortland is about to use the syringe, the door opens, where the pair find out that most of the house is now boarded up. While trying to find a way out, they are led through a maze of corridors and are split up; Cortland sees the figure  and tries to bribe him, secretly planning to syringe him with the poison. Clint appears, saying ""keep it."" A stunned Cortland tries to get away but trips and accidentally sticks himself with the poison, killing himself in the process. Soon after, Joanna is caught between Clint, who is now wearing the mask, and a small hatch. As her only option, she crawls through the hatchway where it dead-ends, allowing Clint to shut her inside. Clint reveals himself to her and speaks of their child, asking if it was a boy or a girl. He then puts the now dead Cortland and the money inside with her to what is now a wooden coffin, where he then nails it shut tight and sets the house on fire, leaving with his dog. Sam, who now believes that Joanna and Cortland murdered Clint rides out to find his house set ablaze. When the fire is extinguished, there is no trace of a body inside the house anywhere. Sam then rides off and finds a person at Clint's grave, with his back to Sam. Realizing it is Clint, Sam tells him to never to come back, and therefore promising to keep his secret. The final shot reveals that the still alive Joanna and the deceased Cortland now occupy Clint's grave, with the money."

Following these scenes, the film proceeds to breakdown the concept of lucha libre and its cultural significance by following the dual lives of professional luchadores: Extreme Tiger, Angel Negro Jr., and Pancho Cachondo, all working class individuals from Tijuana who become local heroes in the community the moment they put on their masks. The film breaks down Tijuana’s lucha libre components respectively:  Books and other works such as Heather Levi’s The World of Lucha Libre have examined lucha libre as surrounded by universal themes of good versus evil, underdog versus bully, the noble hero outwitting the corrupt nemesis- all themes which play out within Mexican lucha libre. ¡Que viva la lucha! provides captures the dual lives led by professional wrestlers who represent the good  versus the evil  amongst other various themes. The film introduces Extreme Tiger, a local who repairs cars by day, and wrestles as a técnico by night. Within the context of the film, Extreme Tiger is a new star in Tijuana’s lucha libre who is quickly moving up the ranks, and aspires to take his professional wrestling career abroad to Japan. Ultimately, his journey brings him to a mask versus hair match against his rival, where he risks losing his mask, and more importantly, his career. Extreme Tiger prevails and takes Tijuana wrestling to Japan. The técnicos within lucha libre are characterized as charismatic, righteous, and always seeking justice.  ¡Que viva la lucha! also introduces two rudos, Angel Negro Jr. and Pancho Cachondo. Angel Negro Jr. is a young wrestler, at 16, he has become one of the local favorite rudos while still attending high school. El Pancho Cachondo is also a local wrestler, a rudo whose character was inspired by a former Mexican congressman who was photographed in a thong at a bar/ table dance. The role of the rudos in lucha libre serve to represent the corrupt, dishonest evil-doers in society.  “The mask is one the unique iconographies that distinguishes Mexican wrestling”. Through the mask, wrestlers are able to construct and transform into a character that contrasts to their working-class identities.‘’UTS San Diego’’, Latino Film Fest, June 5, 2012  ¡Que viva la lucha! demonstrates how lucha libre in Tijuana is enjoyed by a vast range of spectators ranging from young children to older generations, and across genders. It is a space where fanatics and spectators are able to actively participate through the cheering, insults, and mixed emotions. The film also interviews extreme fanatics to collect lucha libre memorabilia, and dedicated fans that have gained free access to shows . In response to the spectatorship of lucha libre, Vazquez states ““The arenas are considered a free place to let out all anger, excitement, passions”<ref name&story_id ‘’Pajaronian’’, Unmasking Mexican wrestling, June 5, 2012]

To his best knowledge, Kim wasn't aware of how big the responsibility of holding the Lens is. This Lens contains vital information that would enable the Galactic Patrol to face the deadly DNA weapon created by the Boskone Empire. The Arisians initially were the ones who created the Lens in order to stand up to the evil Eddorians, because in spite of their great power, they alone could not vanquish the Eddorian menace. Through the Lens, the Lensmen minds were merged with the cosmic conscientiousness of Arisia. On another side is Lord Helmuth, the ruthless, merciless Boskone leader, who would stop at nothing to get his hands on the Lens. Back to the story at hand, our young hero found himself escaping from the boskone battleships with the assistance of his friend Van Buskirk. Afterward, the Boskone blew up the Planet Mqueie  where Kim and his father Ken lived. Ken was one of the founders of the Galactic Patrol; however, he lost an arm during battle, and if he hadn't, he would have been a Lensman himself. Ken always dreamed of becoming a Lensman, so when he found out that his son became one, he sacrificed his life to save him. Through the movie's events, Kim meets Clarissa MacDougall, who is a nurse working with the Galactic Patrol and there is an immediate attraction between them. It's inevitable that the story would have a climactic ending that would provide an encounter between Lord Helmuth and Kim. Imagine the difference between the two: Kim is a new Lensman, young and naive, who bears the responsibility of protecting the universe on his shoulders. Helmuth is a gigantic alien with great powers and entire armies at his disposal, but what Kim didn't know that he had a great weapon which is stronger than any enemy he might encounter. Eventually Kim realizes that the Lens has the answer, and within it lies great power as well, providing the key to Helmuth's defeat, and he transmits the formula to the Galactic Patrol fleet that is waiting to attack, knowing that they will lose without the answer.

Clint Goodman, the man whose wife and lover tried to get murder him by giving him a toxin, would be buried alive as being mistaken for dead. He would wake up in the coffin and would exact revenge on his wife and her lover. Following the first film, Clint has been living a solitude life elsewhere under the name Michael Haden, while everyone in the original town believes he is dead. His friend, Sheriff Sam Eberly has died, and so Clint decides to come back for the funeral. At the funeral, Sam's niece, Laura Riskin, who knew Clint a long time ago, notices him but he leaves before she could approach him. After his funeral, Laura finds out that Sam bought some stock that is worth $250,000, which he has left for her. While she and her husband Randy decide what to do with the money, Laura decides to use it to start a family but Randy, who hates his life in the small town wants to buy a yacht and leave town for good. Laura doesn't empathize with him, but unknown to her, he is cheating on her with local vixen, Roxanne. He tells her that once he finds a way to get away, he'll leave Laura for her, however she's not patient. Randy hears the story of what happened to Clint and decides to do the same thing to Laura. Meanwhile, Laura eventually corners Clint, who tells her to forget him cause technically he is a wanted man. Randy comes to Laura, and Laura, thinking he has changed, decides to forgive him. When they go out to dinner late that evening, he gives her the very same toxin that was originally given to Clint, slipping it into her wine during their dinner, where he makes plans to ensure what happened to Clint doesn't happen again. Laura seemingly dies after consuming some of the poisoned wine, where she goes into cardiac arrest, and dies suddenly. When the doctor asks Randy if he wants an autopsy he declines, stating that Laura would be against it. The police do not treat the event as suspicious as Laura's family has a history of heart failure. While he is planning her funeral, Clint reads about her death in the paper, which causes him to have a heart attack. When he is at the hospital recuperating, he wants to know how Laura has died, but the doctor only tell him that her funeral is being prepared. He wishes to go to her funeral but the doctor denies him being able to leave the hospital. At the morgue, just as she is about to be embalmed, the machine malfunctions and the staff do not embalm her, despite Randy having previously requested that Laura's body be embalmed twice. After Laura's funeral, Clint approaches Randy warning him that Laura may not be all dead, with Randy questioning who Clint is, as well as his sanity. After Clint has a nightmare about his escaping, he goes to dig Laura up and finds that she really is dead, causing him to die, due to health issues caused by the toxin originally given to him. All of a sudden Laura wakes up and escapes her grave, where she then puts Clint's body in her coffin and fills it up. She goes home to find Randy and Roxanne in bed together. She takes a spear gun and when she hears that Randy wants to have kids with her, she changes her mind, deciding to plot revenge. Over the next few days, Randy starts to notice strange things happening around his home, like the place being really clean and his wife's wedding ring lying in the middle of the table. He then goes to have his wife's grave exhumed to make sure she is really dead, but instead finds Clint's body. When the funeral director wants to know why she wasn't embalmed, they discover that the deceased person was in fact Clint. When they go to exhume Clint's grave, they find the skeletal remains of Joanna and Cort, along with the money they got from selling his business. Randy, who now knows that Laura is still alive decides to leave town and purchase the yacht immediately. As he and Roxanne are packing up, they are trapped inside his shed, she then takes a hose attached to his exhaust pipe and puts it through the vent, causing them both to pass out. Randy and Roxanne awake to find themselves in a bedroom of the yacht with all doors and windows locked. When the yacht leans, he realizes that Laura is trying to bury them alive at sea. He goes to shut off the valve but she has broken it off. In another room, they find a set of funeral clothes and a buoy that says ""Rest in peace Randy and Roxanne"". Laura soon reveals herself and wants to know why Randy tried to kill her. Shortly after, Laura blocks off a vent and before the yacht sinks, she leaves on a speedboat. At the end of the film, Laura leaves her home and goes to Clint's grave, thanking him for what he's done. She then leaves town, with the final shot of Randy and Roxanne screaming after being buried at sea."

Patricia can confirm her story, so Deborah tracks her down. Patricia betrays her, however, still being in love with Seldon.

They live with their widowed mother, Hannah, whose husband was bitten by a rattlesnake when Bless was a young boy. Ever since that day, Hannah has been determined to shield Bless from the hard life of the West and turn him instead into a refined, gentler soul. In so doing, she sometimes embarrasses Bless in front of the ranch's other men. Hannah wants to move to the big, sophisticated city of St. Louis and take her youngest son with her. Bless refuses at the last minute, then feels guilty when the months go by and his unhappy mother becomes ill and passes away. Will, meanwhile, builds the ranch into one of the territory's largest. His primary concerns are rustlers and neighbor Audrey, whom he loves and intends to marry, although he has been slow to commit. What he doesn't know is that Audrey has fallen in love with Bless. Before and during a cattle drive to Abilene, more than once Bless is accused of being cowardly. He fails to adequately back up Hade in a bar fight. A fake rattlesnake is placed on Bless while asleep on the trail, terrifying him. Hade is trampled to death by stampeding cattle. Bless then alienates Will by confessing that he and Audrey wish to marry. When a battle with rustlers begins, however, Bless bravely leads the charge against them, whereupon Will tells Aud that he approves of their future together.

Her sister, Annie  does not want to come down for it, reminding Nicole of the way their mother used to treat them. Nicole tries to contact her cousin, Liz  and her daughter Eva  via video call. After losing the connection, Nicole sees an open door, leading into a dark room and walks inside. Annie arrives, having been informed that Nicole is missing, and finds Nicole's phone along with a photo. That night, she awakes from a bad dream and finds a photo of two pregnant women. She identifies one pregnant woman as her mother but does not recognize the other woman, wearing a floral dress. The next day, Annie attends her mother's funeral and it is shown that Annie has one blue eye and one green eye; her mother also had one green eye and one blue eye. After the funeral, Annie meets Liz and Eva, and the three return to Annie's mother's house. Later, Annie dreams of a shirtless man crying and while she sleeps, her phone shows a map, pinpointing an address. When Annie awakes and sees a figure in the hall, she enters Liz's room and finds her bed empty. An unseen force tries to attack Annie but she is able to escape the house with Eva. At the police station, no one believes Annie's story and a police officer, Bill Creek , implies that Annie may have played a part in both her sister's and cousin's disappearances. In a motel, Annie notices the address from the night before on her phone and sees a blurred figure in a floral dress on the screen. That same night, she dreams of the crying shirtless man again, as well as a dead woman in a floral dress with her severed head strung up. Annie later sorts through her mother's papers and discovers a room she had never seen before on the blueprints of the house. She finds the room and invites her psychic friend Stevie , to the house to see if she can help. In the hidden room, Stevie has a hysterical fit, repeating the name ""Judas"". They then see the corpse of a woman in a floral dress floating above them and Annie realizes it is not her mother's spirit that is haunting the house. Annie searches the word ""Judas"" online, which leads her to a page for ""Judas"", a serial killer. The killer's last known victim was Jennifer Glick, and Annie identifies her as the woman in the floral dress with her mother in the photo. She also finds a crime photo of Jennifer's murder, which shows Jennifer with her severed head, similar to Annie's dream. Annie goes to the address that keeps appearing on her phone and discovers photos of her mother and Jennifer together, realizing that the cross she owns, given to her by her mother, originally belonged to Jennifer. In the photos is also a man listed with the same last name as Annie's mother. Creek returns to the house after finding a mysterious photo pointing to a cupboard, where there is a secret door leading into the hidden room. Creek is then murdered by an unknown assailant. Annie discovers that her mother had a brother, the man in the photos. She performs a ritual in the hidden room and Jennfier tells her that she was murdered by Judas, who is revealed to be the brother of Annie's mother. Annie hides and sees Judas come up from the floor through a secret hatch. He leaves the room through the cupboard door and is heard crying. Annie finds Creek's body and takes his gun, discovering her sister, Nicole's, severed head. Judas hears Annie and attacks her, tying her up. Annie breaks her hands free but Judas slashes her on the shoulder with a knife. As Annie breaks free, Jennifer's spirit pulls her away from Judas and to the gun, which Annie uses to shoot Judas. Staring at his dead body, Annie sees that Judas has one blue eye and one green eye, just like she and her mother. At the end, Annie has gained full custody of Nicole's daughter, Eva. With Liz and Nicole dead, the house has been sold and is under renovations. Just then, Judas' closed eye opens, and he looks around the room. The movie ends with the eye."

Anna is scared stiff that they will be found, and is under heavy watch by a couple of child care workers. She doesn't want Anders to sleep in his own room, for fear that somebody will break in and get him. The child care workers force him to sleep in his own room. Anna eventually goes looking for a babycall , and in the electronics store strikes up an awkward conversation with Helge , a shy gentleman whose mother is dying in hospital.The basis for this fragile relationship is that while Anna is an over-protective mother, Helge is an over-protected son who is unwilling to acknowledge the negative feelings he has about the way his mother treated him as a child. Compelled to feel charitable towards over-protective mothers, Helge is only too eager to ‘understand’ Anna’s refusal to let go of Anders. Similarly, Anna is only too eager to believe that an over-protected son might grow up to understand why his mother would not let him go. The first night that Anders slept in his own room, Anna hears some voices on the babycall, including a lot of screaming, almost as if somebody was being murdered. Anna is terrified and runs into Anders' room, to find that he's sound asleep, not making as much as a murmur. The next day, Anna returns to the electronics store and once again speaks to Helge, who said that her monitor could pick up other frequencies if they were close enough, meaning that the screams were eminating from somewhere inside the building. Anna thinks that she should home-tutor Anders, but the Child care workers insist that he needs to go to school. The first day Anders went to school, Anna waited outside all day for Anders until she could take him home again. Unfortunately, the next day she tried the same thing, and the headmaster asks her to leave.When she returns to the school, Anders tells her that he has a friend that he's going to take home with them. Anna is fairly suspicious of the boy before she even knew his name. The boy hardly speaks at all, let alone to Anna. The next day after hearing more noise from the babycall, and dropping Anders off at school, she gets on a bus and goes to the Café where Helge told her about his past. She then leaves to go to a lake near her flats, following a woman she believes had something to do with the screaming. While she's there, she sees a man drowning a little boy, who is in fact Anders' friend. When they leave, Anna jumps into the water to try and retrieve the boy. She stays underwater for too long and blacks out. She wakes up in a hospital, with a nurse telling her she was found unconscious in a car park, though her clothes were soaking wet. She then goes to Anders' school to get him, but she's told to leave. She returns to the electrical store, where she asks Helge for a voice recorder. He asks her to try it out, but she doesn't know what to say. Instead, he speaks into the recorder, asking Anna if she'd like to go to dinner with him, only if she wanted to. He then plays it back to her, where Anna tells him she'd love to but she can't leave Anders on his own. This is when she suggests that Helge should come over for dinner at her flat. They go for a drink in the Cafe, where she tells Helge that her mind is playing tricks on her, and she remembers things that never happened. Helge then proceeds to take a picture of her, telling her that way she would be able to remember the conversation they had. When Anna gets home with Anders, he suddenly gets angry, telling Anna that they don't need Helge, ripping the picture of her off the fridge and ripping it to pieces. One day Anna returns home from Ander's school, and the front door is open. Going in slowly, she sees that the male social worker is there, and he had let himself into Anna's flat, telling her that the female care worker had quit her job. He then pushes Anna against a wall, saying that he would return later on. Hours later, Helge turns up at Anna's flat, and they have a meal and talk about things. Anna turns on the Babycall and they both hear some very frightful screaming. They hear knocking on the door, and Anna, thinking that it's the male social worker, asks Helge to answer the door and tell the man that Anna was out. Helge does what she says, but there is nobody at the door. Helge turns around to see Anders' ""Friend"" whom Helge actually mistakes for Anders himself. The boy the tells Helge things about what happened to him, showing him bruises on his arm. Helge asked what happened, and the boy replied with ""The same thing that happened to you as a child"". Helge storms into the kitchen and demands that Anna tell him what she had told Anders, not knowing that it wasn't really him. Anna replies that she hasn't told him anything, and Helge decides to get Anders and ask him again, in front of Anna. Anna screams at Helge that Anders is her son, and he has no right to go barging in. Helge leaves the flat, leaving Anna terrified. The next day, Anna turns up at the elctronics store to apologise, but the shopworker tells her that Helge is at the hospital, because his mother is dying. Anders tells Anna that he's seen his father, and they hear a knocking on the door. Anna picks up a knife and answers it, seeing that it's the male care worker. She then stabs him in the throat, and Helge turns up. When he sees the careworker, he tells him that he's a caretaker. Helge runs into the apartment, to see Anna sitting on the windowsill with Anders' arms wrapped around her. Just as he reaches Anna, she leans forward and falls off the windowsill deliberately. When Helge rushes to the bottom, he sees Anna on the floor, but no Anders. When he asks her where she is, she can't answer. He is told that Anna's husband killed Anders years ago, and that her husband had killed himself as well. The ending scene shows Anders and the boy sitting on the bed, and Anders tells the boy that his mum will look after them from now on."

Going in slowly, she sees that the male social worker is there, and he had let himself into Anna's flat, telling her that the female care worker had quit her job. He then pushes Anna against a wall, saying that he would return later on. Hours later, Helge turns up at Anna's flat, and they have a meal and talk about things. Anna turns on the Babycall and they both hear some very frightful screaming.

The boy the tells Helge things about what happened to him, showing him bruises on his arm. Helge asked what happened, and the boy replied with ""The same thing that happened to you as a child"". Helge storms into the kitchen and demands that Anna tell him what she had told Anders, not knowing that it wasn't really him. Anna replies that she hasn't told him anything, and Helge decides to get Anders and ask him again, in front of Anna. Anna screams at Helge that Anders is her son, and he has no right to go barging in. Helge leaves the flat, leaving Anna terrified. The next day, Anna turns up at the elctronics store to apologise, but the shopworker tells her that Helge is at the hospital, because his mother is dying. Anders tells Anna that he's seen his father, and they hear a knocking on the door. Anna picks up a knife and answers it, seeing that it's the male care worker. She then stabs him in the throat, and Helge turns up. When he sees the careworker, he tells him that he's a caretaker. Helge runs into the apartment, to see Anna sitting on the windowsill with Anders' arms wrapped around her. Just as he reaches Anna, she leans forward and falls off the windowsill deliberately. When Helge rushes to the bottom, he sees Anna on the floor, but no Anders. When he asks her where she is, she can't answer. He is told that Anna's husband killed Anders years ago, and that her husband had killed himself as well.

Anna is scared stiff that they will be found, and is under heavy watch by a couple of child care workers. She doesn't want Anders to sleep in his own room, for fear that somebody will break in and get him. The child care workers force him to sleep in his own room. Anna eventually goes looking for a babycall , and in the electronics store strikes up an awkward conversation with Helge , a shy gentleman whose mother is dying in hospital.The basis for this fragile relationship is that while Anna is an over-protective mother, Helge is an over-protected son who is unwilling to acknowledge the negative feelings he has about the way his mother treated him as a child. Compelled to feel charitable towards over-protective mothers, Helge is only too eager to ‘understand’ Anna’s refusal to let go of Anders. Similarly, Anna is only too eager to believe that an over-protected son might grow up to understand why his mother would not let him go. The first night that Anders slept in his own room, Anna hears some voices on the babycall, including a lot of screaming, almost as if somebody was being murdered. Anna is terrified and runs into Anders' room, to find that he's sound asleep, not making as much as a murmur. The next day, Anna returns to the electronics store and once again speaks to Helge, who said that her monitor could pick up other frequencies if they were close enough, meaning that the screams were eminating from somewhere inside the building. Anna thinks that she should home-tutor Anders, but the Child care workers insist that he needs to go to school. The first day Anders went to school, Anna waited outside all day for Anders until she could take him home again. Unfortunately, the next day she tried the same thing, and the headmaster asks her to leave.When she returns to the school, Anders tells her that he has a friend that he's going to take home with them. Anna is fairly suspicious of the boy before she even knew his name. The boy hardly speaks at all, let alone to Anna. The next day after hearing more noise from the babycall, and dropping Anders off at school, she gets on a bus and goes to the Café where Helge told her about his past. She then leaves to go to a lake near her flats, following a woman she believes had something to do with the screaming. While she's there, she sees a man drowning a little boy, who is in fact Anders' friend. When they leave, Anna jumps into the water to try and retrieve the boy. She stays underwater for too long and blacks out. She wakes up in a hospital, with a nurse telling her she was found unconscious in a car park, though her clothes were soaking wet. She then goes to Anders' school to get him, but she's told to leave. She returns to the electrical store, where she asks Helge for a voice recorder. He asks her to try it out, but she doesn't know what to say. Instead, he speaks into the recorder, asking Anna if she'd like to go to dinner with him, only if she wanted to. He then plays it back to her, where Anna tells him she'd love to but she can't leave Anders on his own. This is when she suggests that Helge should come over for dinner at her flat. They go for a drink in the Cafe, where she tells Helge that her mind is playing tricks on her, and she remembers things that never happened. Helge then proceeds to take a picture of her, telling her that way she would be able to remember the conversation they had.

The kingdom of Kothakpur and Pehelwanpur are attacked and reduced to rubble. Dholakpur too suffers a similar fate. The king of Dholakpur, Induverma, and the princess Indumati, are abducted by the aliens. Bheem and his friends are shown playing a Twenty20 cricket match against their rival team lead by Kichak from Pehelwanpur. Bheem's team scores 115/2 from 20 overs, aided by a strong innings from their skipper Bheem. In return, Kichak's team scores 109/4; with 6 runs needed to even the scores. Kichak hits a lofty shot in the air, but before the ball could land, it is destroyed by a laser beam from an alien vessel. The aliens continue their rampage, setting a majority the nearby huts and trees on fire. Instead of fleeing, Bheem decides to confront them, and call them out. The leader of the aliens, Kyto reveals that they are from the planet Zekan, and they have come to take control over earth. On Bheem's persuasion, he decides to give earth a chance. Kyto says that the following day, they would have a competition- Bheem and his friends would have to face the aliens in a game of 'Plutocket', where if Team Prithvi  wins, the aliens would leave their planet alone. However, if the Zekans win, earth would be theirs forever. Bheem and his friends are joined by Kichak's team, but are faced with a major problem of having no idea about how the game Plutocket is played. One of Kichak's friends, Motu, informs that the aliens are practicing nearby. Upon spying on their practice, Bheem and his friends learn that Plutocket is actually what the Zekans refer to Cricket, and realize that they might actually stand a chance. Team earth is formed; Bheem, Raju, Kichak, Kalia, Dholu, Bholu, Jaggu, Chutki, Manna, Motu, and Poptya are selected as the final eleven. On the day of the match, the arriving aliens are confronted by team earth. Team earth wins the toss and chooses to bat. With Bheem leading from the front, and fueled by contributions from Kichak and Chutki, they manage to put 117 runs on the board after 20 overs, at the loss of 9 wickets. Team Zekan's batting starts aggressively, with their openers Liska and Peptik troubling earth's bowlers with their weird batting styles. Bheem observes that each of the aliens have some definite characteristic, which they can take advantage of. Shortly thereafter, they bounce back in the game and manage to send a handful of Zekanians like Bagel, Puro, and Dilo back into the pavilion. However, Kyto remains not out, and continues to fight through his innings, completing his half century. At the end of 19 overs, Zekans are at 102, requiring 16 runs off the last over. They hit a six off the first ball to ease the pressure, but team earth manages to hold them within the walls. With 6 runs required off the last ball to win the match, having 1 wicket in hand, Kyto hits the balls high in the air. Dholu and Bholu are the fielders running towards the ball, and on the verge of colliding with each other. Surprisingly, they pull off an exceptional double team move to take the catch and dismiss Kyto, thus winning the match for their team and their planet. According to the deal, Kyto sets free the king and the princess. King Induverma and Kyto agree upon peace relations between the two planets in the future, and the Zekanians leaves earth in peace. The next day, Kalia is shown bragging to Dholu and Bholu about the aliens, saying some of them are not so bad after all. Jaggu drops from the tree wearing an alien mask and asks What do you think about me?, which is enough to have the three running on their heels. Bheem and his friends have laugh at the sight, as the film comes to an end.

Bheem's team scores 115/2 from 20 overs, aided by a strong innings from their skipper Bheem. In return, Kichak's team scores 109/4; with 6 runs needed to even the scores. Kichak hits a lofty shot in the air, but before the ball could land, it is destroyed by a laser beam from an alien vessel. The aliens continue their rampage, setting a majority the nearby huts and trees on fire. Instead of fleeing, Bheem decides to confront them, and call them out. The leader of the aliens, Kyto reveals that they are from the planet Zekan, and they have come to take control over earth. On Bheem's persuasion, he decides to give earth a chance. Kyto says that the following day, they would have a competition- Bheem and his friends would have to face the aliens in a game of 'Plutocket', where if Team Prithvi  wins, the aliens would leave their planet alone. However, if the Zekans win, earth would be theirs forever. Bheem and his friends are joined by Kichak's team, but are faced with a major problem of having no idea about how the game Plutocket is played. One of Kichak's friends, Motu, informs that the aliens are practicing nearby. Upon spying on their practice, Bheem and his friends learn that Plutocket is actually what the Zekans refer to Cricket, and realize that they might actually stand a chance. Team earth is formed; Bheem, Raju, Kichak, Kalia, Dholu, Bholu, Jaggu, Chutki, Manna, Motu, and Poptya are selected as the final eleven. On the day of the match, the arriving aliens are confronted by team earth. Team earth wins the toss and chooses to bat. With Bheem leading from the front, and fueled by contributions from Kichak and Chutki, they manage to put 117 runs on the board after 20 overs, at the loss of 9 wickets. Team Zekan's batting starts aggressively, with their openers Liska and Peptik troubling earth's bowlers with their weird batting styles. Bheem observes that each of the aliens have some definite characteristic, which they can take advantage of. Shortly thereafter, they bounce back in the game and manage to send a handful of Zekanians like Bagel, Puro, and Dilo back into the pavilion. However, Kyto remains not out, and continues to fight through his innings, completing his half century. At the end of 19 overs, Zekans are at 102, requiring 16 runs off the last over. They hit a six off the first ball to ease the pressure, but team earth manages to hold them within the walls. With 6 runs required off the last ball to win the match, having 1 wicket in hand, Kyto hits the balls high in the air. Dholu and Bholu are the fielders running towards the ball, and on the verge of colliding with each other. Surprisingly, they pull off an exceptional double team move to take the catch and dismiss Kyto, thus winning the match for their team and their planet. According to the deal, Kyto sets free the king and the princess. King Induverma and Kyto agree upon peace relations between the two planets in the future, and the Zekanians leaves earth in peace. The next day, Kalia is shown bragging to Dholu and Bholu about the aliens, saying some of them are not so bad after all. Jaggu drops from the tree wearing an alien mask and asks What do you think about me?, which is enough to have the three running on their heels. Bheem and his friends have laugh at the sight, as the film comes to an end.

King Xerxes holds a great feast for all the people to attend. Hadassah  longs to go to Jerusalem to see the Holy Land and prepares to leave with the caravan along with her friend, Jesse Ben-Joseph. They stop by the King’s feast before marching to war to avenge his father’s death. Hadassah and Jesse witness the King summoning Queen Vashti. Queen Vashti was opposed to the war, desiring King Xerxes to enhance his kingdom instead. She holds her own feast in protest to the war. When the king summons her to his own feast, she refuses to come stating, “I am queen, and I will not lower my dignity… or shame my crown by wearing it before your drunk, and thinly veiled war council.” Because of this, King Xerxes is advised to banish her and select a more worthy queen. All beautiful virgin women in the stronghold of Susa are brought in so Xerxes could leave behind a queen to keep the kingdom unified. Under the command of her foster-father, “Uncle Mordecai” , Hadassah does not reveal her nationality or family and changes her name to “Esther” . She is taken in with the rest of the selected women and given cosmetics, perfumes, and treatments under the care of Hegai, the king’s royal eunuch. Through her quick wit, intelligence, and integrity, she becomes Hegai’s favorite contestant. On their night with the king, the contestants are allowed to bring whatever they wished with them from the harem. They went in the evening and returned in the morning to a second harem to another royal eunuch who was custodian to the concubines. They would not be able to return to the king unless she pleased him and he summoned her by name. During their preparation, Hegai discovers Esther could read and listens to her reading to the other contestants. He admires her bravery, and stamina. Late into the night, he brings her to King Xerxes to read to him. She starts reading from the assigned scroll and then begins telling the love story of Jacob and Rachel . He is amused and intrigued and dismisses her, saying she would read to him again. From this interaction, Esther falls in love with the King. When it is Esther’s turn for her ‘one night with the king’, she only wears what Hegai advises. She wins the kings favor by revealing her heart to him. He chooses her and crowns her queen. Simultaneously, Haman is promoted to the highest-ranking official. He has all the king’s servants at the royal gate to kneel before him. Mordecai refuses, declaring he will only kneel before God and the king. He announces himself before Haman to be a son of Abraham, a Jew. Because of this, Haman, filled with vengeance and hatred, seeks to destroy Mordecai and all his people. Esther discovers the plot and breaks protocol by going before the king unsummoned, risking her life to plead for her people. The king lowers his scepter to her and spares her life out of his love for her. She invites the king and Haman to a banquet and there reveals her nationality and the Haman’s plot to kill the Jews. The king, overwhelmed by her revelation, leaves the banquet. Haman then assaults Esther. The king saves her and, in his fury, commands Haman be hung on the gallows he erected to hang Mordecai for revenge. After Haman is taken away, the king goes to Esther's side. Esther asks, ""What made you come back?"" And the king responds with, ""I saw the stars."" Then King Xerxes kisses Esther, with the camera pulling away from the small temple. The ending shows Mordecai being made the Prince of Persia and him making a decree in his name, with flashbacks of when Esther was made Queen and the crowd of Jews cheering in the streets. In the last scenes the camera shows the small temple and Mordecai saying, ""Thus dictated, I order this decree sent out under the great seal of Mordecai, Prince of Persia, a Jew."""

The montage ends with Celeste walking away from Jesse during a party, while Jesse looks sad. In present day, Celeste and Jesse still get along well. Celeste is a successful trend analyzer and runs her own media company with her partner, Scott . Celeste's media company has just signed Riley , a teen pop-star whom Celeste does not respect and openly bashes during a T.V. interview. Jesse on the other hand is an unemployed artist who seems to be in no hurry to find employment. One night, they have dinner with their mutual best friends, Beth  and Tucker , who are engaged. During dinner, while Celeste and Jesse look at the menu and speak with German accents to each other, Beth becomes increasingly annoyed and confronts them about their abnormal relationship. She expresses that it's not normal for them to spend everyday together like nothing is wrong. It is then revealed that they have been separated for 6 months and in the process of divorce. Celeste and Jesse tell Beth that it's better this way because when they were together, they fought all the time and Beth and Tucker get caught in the middle. Angry, Beth storms off, with Tucker following her, having the same feelings. In the car ride home, Celeste and Jesse discuss whether they feel it's weird that they spend so much together, and they assure each other it's not weird because they are each other's best friend. One day, Jesse is out with his friend Skillz  who feels that Jesse should start dating other women. Jesse informs him that he's hoping for Celeste to ""come back around"". It is obvious that Jesse is still in-love with Celeste and is hoping she will change her mind about the divorce. While at work, Scott is questioning Celeste about whether she made the right decision divorcing Jesse and if she's truly over him, she would also begin dating. One night, Celeste invites Jesse over to help her put together an Ikea dresser. They become frustrated from trying to built the drawer and they instead get drunk on wine and spend the night together. They both wake up and Celeste instantly regrets what happened the night before and this upsets Jesse and he storms out angry because he thought the night together meant Celeste had finally ""came back around"". Celeste goes on a business trip and repeatedly tries to get a hold of Jesse. Jesse is then seen on a date with Veronica , a woman Skillz set him up with 3 months ago, but never called back after the first date. Celeste returns home after two weeks and Jesse comes over to speak to her. Jesse informs her that he is going to have a baby with Veronica, a woman she never knew he went out with 3 months ago, and wants to try to make things work for the sake of the baby. Celeste becomes disturbed by this and asks to be excused while she goes to the bathroom and becomes upset. She expresses her concern to Beth who questions about her having second thoughts with the divorce. Celeste assures Beth that she's not having second thoughts and says she's going on a date. Celeste goes on a date with Max . During the date, they run into Jesse. This makes Celeste feel awkward and ask Max to leave. Max says he's not going to leave and meets Jesse, whom he finds is a cool guy. After the date, Celeste ask him when he'd like to go out again, but Max turns her down and tell her that she's not ready and she should take her time, just like he did when he was going through a divorce. Her second date is with Rupert , a model/actor who is young and hot. He sings to her during their date and she abruptly leaves, telling him she left a candle lit at home. Celeste is clearly uncomfortable with his singing and age. Her third date is with a photographer whom she is a big fan of. They initially hit it off and go back to the hotel and make-out. During their make-out session, he begins to masturbate while on top of her. This shocks her and she slowly creeps away from under him and leaves, but he continues to masturbate. In the mean time, Jesse is becoming closer to Veronica and even becomes a vegan. Jesse invites Celeste out for lunch at a vegan restaurant to confront her about their divorce papers. He informs Celeste that she needs to sign the papers because Veronica is not a U.S. citizen and they must get married for her to stay. This upsets Celeste and she storms out stating she's busy because she has a job, unlike some people and says she'll sign the papers when she has the time. As time passes, Celeste realizes that her decision to divorce Jesse was impulsive and selfish and starts to realize she still loves him and wants to be with him. Celeste ask Jesse to meet her at a bar where she express her interest in trying again and that she'll try harder and do better. Jesse becomes upset and leaves. Celeste chases him outside and they begin to argue. Celeste calls Jesse a coward and Jesse tells her she'll be alone forever. The argument ends with Celeste telling Jesse never to call her again and Jesse assuring her that she does not have to worry. Celeste becomes increasingly depressed and begins to drink and smoke weed excessively. In the process, she begins to have a relationship with Paul , who tries to pick her up after Yoga earlier in the film. She initially turns him down, but begins to warm up to him after she runs into him at a party. During Beth and Tucker's bridal party, Celeste becomes drunk and passes out on a floaty in the pool, with everyone staring at her. After the bridal party, she gets a call from Riley who ask her to come over. Celeste believes that Riley is angry over the logo she designed for her that unintentionally resembles a penis with balls going into a butt. This logo sparks controversy with fans. However, Riley reveals that she actually likes the logo because she believes it speaks to her gay fan base. Celeste thinks that Riley could be the next Lady Gaga because of this. Celeste arrives at Riley's house to find her in tears. Riley reveals that she has had a secret boyfriend, who she discovered has been cheating on her. They begin to bond over the common experience of heartbreak and slowly become friends. Later, Celeste runs into Rupert while walking with Riley and introduces them. At Beth and Tucker's wedding, Celeste makes a toast. She tells the newlyweds to appreciate each other, to be patient, and to try harder, like she should have. This speech touches Jesse, and he thanks Celeste. They are able to reconcile and become friends again. Later, on a karaoke date, Celeste informs Paul that she cannot continue to date him because of her divorce, which she feels she must go through alone. He tells her to call him when she is ready. We then see Celeste and Jesse finally signing their divorce papers and laughing at each other's inside joke. Their lawyers look on, confused by their laughter. Celeste wishes Jesse well. She finally asks Jesse if he loves Veronica, to which he responds that he does. Celeste tells him to keep fighting for it. In the final scene, Celeste calls Paul while driving. She gets his voicemail, so she leaves a message stating she's ready — to beat him at Scrabble."

Felix is walking in an open field, still wondering how to obtain some food. Suddenly spotting Father Time standing by, Felix asks the old time master to put him in a period that may do well for him, just for a day. Father Time at first declines, but agrees when Felix offers a silver dollar. The time wizard brings out a wand a grants Felix his wish. Father Time sends him into was the pre-historic era where cavemen and dinosaurs were common. Looking for something to eat, Felix picks up a large bone, only to be chased by a giant lizard. After outrunning another dinosaur, Felix finds himself in front of a pre-historic tailor shop. Inside the shop, a caveman is looking for a suitable garment but appears uninterested in the few clothes the tailor shows him. The tailor steps outside and notices Felix. Finding the cat's pelt as a good material, the tailor lures him into the shop, where a frenzy happens. The caveman then emerges wearing a black garment with a long tail on it, and Felix shows up almost entirely bones from foot to neck. The caveman removes the outfit to go for a swim in the lake. Felix uses this opportunity to get back his pelt. He continues wandering until he comes across a mastodon. Father Time has been napping on the ground until his alarm clock rings.

Finding nothing inside, he heads toward a nearby apartment building. To his amazement, he finds roast chicken hanging next to an upper window. To reach it, he sneaks into a musician's tuba which then propels him upward. Felix gets his hands on the meat, only to have himself grabbed and thrown back down by a resident. Felix is walking in an open field, still wondering how to obtain some food. Suddenly spotting Father Time standing by, Felix asks the old time master to put him in a period that may do well for him, just for a day. Father Time at first declines, but agrees when Felix offers a silver dollar. The time wizard brings out a wand a grants Felix his wish. Father Time sends him into was the pre-historic era where cavemen and dinosaurs were common. Looking for something to eat, Felix picks up a large bone, only to be chased by a giant lizard. After outrunning another dinosaur, Felix finds himself in front of a pre-historic tailor shop. Inside the shop, a caveman is looking for a suitable garment but appears uninterested in the few clothes the tailor shows him. The tailor steps outside and notices Felix. Finding the cat's pelt as a good material, the tailor lures him into the shop, where a frenzy happens. The caveman then emerges wearing a black garment with a long tail on it, and Felix shows up almost entirely bones from foot to neck. The caveman removes the outfit to go for a swim in the lake. Felix uses this opportunity to get back his pelt. He continues wandering until he comes across a mastodon. Father Time has been napping on the ground until his alarm clock rings. He wakes and finds it is time to return Felix to the present. Felix is still having trouble with the mastodon but the time wizard's magic finally takes effect and Felix is at last sent back to his own period. Though he has to return to searching trash cans again, he figures it is better than his experience of the pre-historic era.

Paul and his Dad, a feckless has-been of a character, are like ships that pass in the night. Whilst both know something is amiss, both do nothing about it. The coldness and lack of love that surround Paul pose the question in our mind - is the grim battle ground of the playing field a warmer and more welcoming world than his home life? At sixteen for all these kids it's sink or swim and each one is a prisoner in this world where fear rules.

On the way, a motorcycle is coming from the opposite direction, and its rider thought his car is another motorcycle because of only a single light is glowing. Fortunately, the two motorists passed each other without collission. While continuing on his journey, Felix is flagged down by a cop who confronts him about his headlight problem. The cat then comes to a store selling car accessories to replace his lights. He wanted a pair of Mazda light bulbs but the store clerk tells him no stock of the product is available, and therefore makes suggestion of other lights, claiming they would work well also. Felix puts on the regular bulbs on his vehicle, and continues his travel. With one of the lights shining horizontally and other one diagonally upward, Felix is again flagged by a cop who tells him to have them glow on the road. He then tries to adjust their focus but to no avail, and therefore goes on driving. This resulted in disturbed residents on the way firing guns and physically assaulting him. Moments later, his newly replaced lights burn out. As a consequence, Felix's car runs into a tree, then a boulder, and falls off a cliff. Luckily, his vehicle isn't seriously damaged, and Felix finally reaches the church. Much to his surprise, he finds a note on a wall saying he is too late and someone else took and decided to own his bride. Felix, however, refuses to concede, and is determined to get her back.

Sardar's second wife, Durga, is now a maid in Ramadir Singh's  household. Danish and Asgar attempt to convince Faizal  that his friend Fazlu was the mole who spied for the Qureshis. Danish, in order to get a smaller jail sentence, surrenders to the police in a concocted case of thievery. After the court hearing, however, he is assassinated by Sultan Qureshi. A stoned and oblivious Faizal, returns home to the funeral of his dead brother. He gets in a conversation between Nagma  and Farhan where she identifies Faizal as a terminal junkie incapable of exacting revenge for the family. Fazlu becomes a politician and wins Wasseypur's local elections. Faizal goes to congratulate him but by the end of the day brutally murders him instead. After Fazlu's gruesome murder, Faizal takes over as the new head of the crime syndicate. With the help of an ambitious but fraudulent small time businessman, Shamshad Alam, he attempts to expand his business interests. Faizal Khan and Ramadhir Singh meet and discuss the circumstances which led to the blood feud. Ramadhir gives his consent to Faizal to retaliate against Sultan Qureshi under the condition that the Khan-Singh feud come to an end. After Faizal and Mohsina's ([[Huma Qureshi  marriage, Faizal kills Sultan's men who were involved in the murder of his father and his brother. Sultan, still oblivious of the truce between the Singhs and the Khans, calls Ramadhir, asking for permission to retaliate. A 14-yr-old Babua Khan robs local stores on the pretext of being Faizal's brother. An opportunistic Definite Khan , Faizal's stepbrother, also a nuisance to the public, aspires to become a gangster. Though being brought up in Ramadhir Singh's household, he grows to idolize Faizal and thus double-crosses Singh. At the instigation of local shopkeepers, Perpendicular is murdered by Sultan Qureshi. At the same time, Shamshad Alam, on being caught short-changing Faizal, rats on Faizal's illegal operation to the police and gets him arrested. In order to gain Faizal's appreciation, Definite attacks Shamshad Alam, grievously injuring him. Faizal, however, comes under the sway of Ikhlakh who, unknown to him, is Ramadhir Singh's mole; and in his greed for money, ignores Definite who eventually grows estranged from him. Faizal decides to join politics and contest a rigged election against Ramadhir Singh. After Faizal's release, Sultan in a last-ditch effort, arranges an ambush on the Khan mansion to eliminate Faizal and his whole family  but everyone escapes unharmed. Enraged at their failure, during the festivities of Muharram, Sultan's henchman brutally kill Asghar and Nagma at the marketplace, leaving Faizal blind with rage. With Definite's help, Sultan is tracked and gunned down. On the voting day, Ikhlakh takes Faizal to a deserted place in the intention to kill him but Definite double-crosses Ikhlakh and kills him. Definite informs Faizal that Ramadhir is in the same hospital where Shamshad has been admitted. Before they part, Mohsina tells Faizal that she is pregnant, leaving very little effect on Faizal who is determined to kill Ramadhir. Faizal and Definite reach the hospital along with a handful of men. Faizal alone slaughters all of Ramadhir's men leaving Definite and the others outside to keep the police at bay. Faizal kills Shamshad, and finally finds Ramadhir hiding in the hospital's toilet. Ramadhir quietly accepts his death and sits down on the toilet seat as Faizal viciously pumps several bullets from several rifles into him. Later, Faizal and Definite, who are the only survivors, surrender to the police. After the police jeep stops near a motel, Definite gets down and shoots Faizal to death. He walks towards J.P. and Durga, knowing that both their wishes are fulfilled. The last scene of the movie shows Mohsina and Farhan with Mohsina's and Faizal's son, who have relocated to Mumbai to start afresh.

The following day, Seth is welcomed by her father who has now regained his strength, thanks to the healing. Everyone in town is astounded. Amazed by his grandfather's new found health, Jed , Seth's perturbed son, asks for help as his half-sister Cookie  is suffering from a renal disease called Glomerulonephritis and he would like to bring her to Manang Elsa. Seth refuses, because she does not want to be held accountable by her ex-husband and his wife in case anything goes wrong. But as Jed pleads, Seth eventually agrees to give them the address, on the condition that they do not tell anyone that she gave the. When Seth arrives home, a party is going on. She's extremely disappointed to see that her father has gone back to his old drinking habits. Seth then finds out what the visitors want: they also want to be healed. Ding , a policeman, is suffering from a skin disease called psoriasis. Alma reveals a growth on her foot which has prevented her from migrating to Dubai. Chona , a neighbor, has a goiter. Greta , another neighbor, has a lump in her breast and Cacai , a young blind girl. The group goes to see Manang Elsa, but Melchor , her assistant and brother, informs them that Manang Elsa is sick and refuses to see anyone. But due to Seth's pleas, Manang Elsa eventually cures all of them. On the way home, Seth crosses paths with Jed and Cookie, who is now secretly going to the faith healer. The following day, everyone except Cookie is healed. She is taken to a hospital due to a high fever. Seth is then confronted by her ex-husband and grows angry. Days pass and Cookie is finally healed. Seth then starts to notice the behavioral changes of those who have been healed, noticing that they have become passive and quiet. One night, everyone is terrified after Chona, the woman who had Goiter, is found dead, after slashing her own neck with a shard of broken glass. At the funeral, Chona's husband Rex  tells Seth that Chona had seen a crow in her dreams before she died. The batch of people who were healed speak out about having had the same dream. As time passes, the batch of people who were healed become hysterical and angry. After a blackout, Seth is visited by an entity in the form of Greta, who stretches her neck towards her back. Disturbed, Seth follows her. While the real Greta is smoking, the entity who has her image possesses her. She then proceeds to kill her husband Ruben  by decapitating him with a machete and then commits suicide by hanging herself. Later on, Seth sees Ding's doppelganter walk past her and calls Ding to warn him. The real Ding is on a raid, and once possessed by his doppelganger, begins to shoot everyone. The police are then forced to shoot him dead.A shadowy figure who is behind in the prison bars raising hands to a mysterious light. Meanwhile, Alma panics, knowing that she is next. After the horrifying events surrounding Greta and Ding, Seth is confused as to why her father has not suffered the same fate. She asks him if had seen a crow in his dreams, but to no avail. Seth, along with Cacai's mother, Cita  decides to confront Manang Elsa about the chain of deaths, only to be informed by Melchor, that she had been killed by Dario, the man who much earlier, was thought to have only fainted but who had actually died from a heart attack. Melchor reveals that Manang Elsa unknowingly ""cured"" the dead, and now the life that was used to resuscitate him will cost the lives of the people that Manang Elsa ""cured"" after him. Melchor tells her that the best way to destroy the curse is to kill Dario. Seth sets out to warn the others. While stuck in traffic, she sees Alma's doppelganger walk down the street towards Alma's dormitory. Seth calls Alma to warn her that her doppelganger is on its way to possess her. When Alma refuses to believe her, Seth sneaks into her apartment to find her but is too late. Alma, who has already been possessed by her doppelganger, murders her dorm mates and sets herself on fire. Afraid for her daughter's life, Cita brings Cacai to a Chinese temple to be guarded by their relative monks. Inevitably, Seth sees Cacai's image and warns Cita. However, Cita is distracted by a dragon dance, and loses Cacai who is then controlled by her doppelganger. Cacai massacres the praying monks and kills herself by getting impaled on a flagpole, much to Cita's misery. Seth is haunted by the spirits of the fallen, who blame her for their deaths because Seth is the key to the healer. Now, only one is left: Cookie. Determined to save her, Seth and Jed  takes Cookie to a secluded house and installs CCTV cameras to monitor her. To end the curse, Seth goes to jail to see Dario  and bring him food that she has poisoned. Dario reveals to her that he is no longer Dario but a different entity. He warns her that those who have been cured by Manang Elsa will be Possessed by their own alter-egos and their souls shall be offered to him. He then tells her that the best way to end the bloodshed and the continuous spread of the curse is to kill him. Seth discards the plan of poisoning him as she cannot kill anyone. When she returns to the safehouse where Cookie is hiding, she sees the evil image of Cookie who has yet to possess the real one, and manages to get rid of her. Thinking that she has killed Cookie's doppelganger, Seth lets Cookie back into her house. But Cookie sees her doppelganger again, which chases her and possesses her. The possessed Cookie appears at Seth's house and attacks her with a knife. As she is about to get stabbed to death, Jed arrives and stops Cookie. As the fight goes on, Cookie's doppelganger creates another doppelganger in Jed's image who then tries to stab Seth. Dario, who is behind bars, is anticipating the new life that will be transported to him. Melchor shows up at the prison and shoots him dead. The doppelgangers vanish. Melchor is pinned down by officers. Seth and Jed shake the unconscious Cookie, who then wakes up for one final scare."

After killing a man who breaks free of his restraints and tries to escape them, Peter and Crusty visit various locations in town, and enjoy some fireworks at a celebration. Peter is then shown in his basement, taunting a semi-conscious man who has had nails hammered into various parts of his body. Next, Peter and Crusty go on a hike, assault a vagrant they find sleeping under a bridge, and cut a man open and pull his gurgling intestines out. The two then attend a party, where Peter does drugs, Crusty flirts with other women, and a live rat is fed to a pet alligator. Around Christmas, Peter and Crusty break into a family's home. Peter bludgeons the father with a hammer and suffocates the mother, who he is unsuccessful in trying to rape due to being unable to attain an erection. When the dead couple's young daughter stumbles onto the two intruders, Crusty strangles her.

Days after their disappearance, Brad and ten of the other twelve missing soldiers turned up unconscious outside of their base. When the men woke up in the LRMC in Germany, they were found to be suffering from random and unexplainable physical impairments; Brad lost the ability to walk, see in color and taste, and is plagued by frequent and severe headaches that are exacerbated by high-pitched noise. Brad is eventually sent home to his family, where his strange condition causes some tension, something not helped by his sister Ashley's insensitive boyfriend, Gavyn. Initially, Brad appears fine mentally, but as hours pass his body and mind deteriorate; he has periods of unresponsiveness, suffers from seizures, a strange wound on his right foot worsens, he becomes even more gaunt, his eyes and tongue swell, his fingernails and teeth yellow, and he begins expelling a black fluid from his ears, mouth and anus. In the morning after his return, Brad is found by his mother, Karmen, ingesting a large amount of salt in the kitchen, having apparently entered the room under his own power. As his mother gets his wheelchair from out of the parlor, Brad returns to his bed, and becomes semi-catatonic, refusing to move and denying that he needs to go to a hospital when his brother Bruce suggests it. When Gavyn stops by, his blunt comments about Brad's condition and his relationship with Ashley sparks a brief fight between him and Bruce. After Bruce goes outside to cool off, and gets into an argument with his mother in the yard, Brad  wheels into the kitchen, stands up, and attacks Gavyn. Gavyn's screams alert Bruce and Karmen, who find him dead from severe head trauma, and Brad convulsing on the floor. As Bruce tries to revive Brad, Ashley  leads their traumatized mother out of the room. As soon as Ashley and Karmen leave, Brad springs to life, rips Bruce's lower jaw off, and clumsily stumbles after his mother and sister, emitting bizarre, animalistic noises. Brad finds Ashley and Karmen, and kills the former by punching through a door and impaling her through the neck on the splintered wood, subsequently ripping her head off. As Brad struggles to get to her, Karmen bludgeons him with a metal wall ornament, prompting a slug-like creature to burst out of his sella turcica . Karmen beats Brad and the entity to death, and the film ends with home movies of the Robacks, and Karmen's husband returning home to discover his wife has hung herself in the garage.

Initially, Brad appears fine mentally, but as hours pass his body and mind deteriorate; he has periods of unresponsiveness, suffers from seizures, a strange wound on his right foot worsens, he becomes even more gaunt, his eyes and tongue swell, his fingernails and teeth yellow, and he begins expelling a black fluid from his ears, mouth and anus. In the morning after his return, Brad is found by his mother, Karmen, ingesting a large amount of salt in the kitchen, having apparently entered the room under his own power. As his mother gets his wheelchair from out of the parlor, Brad returns to his bed, and becomes semi-catatonic, refusing to move and denying that he needs to go to a hospital when his brother Bruce suggests it. When Gavyn stops by, his blunt comments about Brad's condition and his relationship with Ashley sparks a brief fight between him and Bruce. After Bruce goes outside to cool off, and gets into an argument with his mother in the yard, Brad  wheels into the kitchen, stands up, and attacks Gavyn. Gavyn's screams alert Bruce and Karmen, who find him dead from severe head trauma, and Brad convulsing on the floor. As Bruce tries to revive Brad, Ashley  leads their traumatized mother out of the room. As soon as Ashley and Karmen leave, Brad springs to life, rips Bruce's lower jaw off, and clumsily stumbles after his mother and sister, emitting bizarre, animalistic noises. Brad finds Ashley and Karmen, and kills the former by punching through a door and impaling her through the neck on the splintered wood, subsequently ripping her head off. As Brad struggles to get to her, Karmen bludgeons him with a metal wall ornament, prompting a slug-like creature to burst out of his sella turcica . Karmen beats Brad and the entity to death, and the film ends with home movies of the Robacks, and Karmen's husband returning home to discover his wife has hung herself in the garage.

As they are packing the master's clothes, Mr. Theeves requests that Droopy acquire someone to help him around the house while they are away, and the first person to come to Droopy's mind is his identical twin brother, Drippy. Droopy contacts Drippy at O'Brien's Gymnasium and explains the situation to him. Drippy arrives later on and displays his superhuman strength by punching his way through the front door before greeting Droopy. Droopy introduces Drippy to Mr. Theeves, who is briefly astonished by Drippy's uncanny resemblance to Droopy, thinking he was seeing double, and is also on the receiving end of Drippy's immense strength while shaking his hand. Mr. Theeves then explains Drippy's duties to him, and tells him that no matter what, no strangers are allowed on the premises. However, while Droopy loads the master's suitcase into his limousine, his old enemy, Spike the Irish bulldog, asks if Droopy can put him up for a little while, since he has had little to no good luck recently. Droopy reluctantly agrees and has Spike go to the back door. As Spike snidely muses about taking advantage of Droopy, the back door opens, but what Spike is unaware of is that it is Drippy who has answered. Spike promptly demands, ""Let me have it, pal,"" and Drippy responds by punching Spike across the terrace. Spike gets caught in a veranda which swings him back into the door as Drippy closes it. Droopy then appears and lets a bewildered Spike inside, but as Droopy fetches some food, Drippy comes back into the kitchen and hits Spike outside with the kitchen table. Droopy, unaware, takes Spike's food outside, assuming Spike wanted to eat in the patio. As Droopy goes back for mustard, Drippy appears again and throws Spike into the swimming pool, leaving him dazed. Droopy then rescues Spike, assuming he wanted to go for a swim, and takes him inside the house. Droopy puts some dry clothes on Spike, but while he goes for some shoes, Drippy appears again and knocks Spike out cold. Droopy, assuming Spike was sleepy, tucks him in bed. Spike wakes up and begins to enjoy the comfort, but when he tries to call Droopy, Drippy responds instead and punches Spike into the bathroom, where Droopy is shaving. Spike accuses Droopy of assaulting him, but Droopy responds by recommending a cold shower for Spike. Expectedly, Drippy goes for a shower as well and hits Spike out, stark naked. Droopy offers to get Spike some clothes, but this time, Spike demands that he accompany Droopy. As Droopy enters a corridor, Drippy appears through another and hits Spike with a shillelagh. Spike angrily demands that Droopy hand it over, but Droopy denies having one. Each time Spike puts Droopy in the corridor, Drippy appears through the other and hits Spike. Assuming it is Droopy hurting him, Spike demands that he stop, but Droopy denies having touched Spike all day. Now believing that Droopy may be going crazy, Spike discreetly calls an ambulance. When the ambulance arrives, Spike calls Droopy, but this time, both Droopy and a surprisingly-friendly Drippy answer. Shocked at the sight of two Droopys, Spike goes berserk and he himself is taken away by the ambulance."

They are greeted by the principal, Mrs. Thorndyke , who emphasizes to Nancy that the school is not a corrective institution but a private preparatory school with a very good reputation. Nancy is immediately harassed by her dormmates that night, and at breakfast the next morning, after Thorndyke officially introduces Nancy to the girls, Myra , their leader, tells Nancy that it was good thing that she did not mention anything about the way they acted the previous night. Myra also tells Nancy about their secret club, ""The Birds of Paradise,"" and introduces her to Eddie , a young groundsman whom the “Birds” take turns dating. Myra is the assistant for Miss Branding , the school’s chemistry teacher, who is writing a thesis about her belief that there is a “terrible power,” “strong enough to destroy the world – buried within each of us.” If she can prove this is the case, she hopes that the scientific community will abandon their experiments with nuclear power and other weapons mass destruction. When Branding tells Myra that she is looking for a special girl on whom to experiment, Myra suggests Nancy. During chemistry class, Myra and her friend Nola  deliberately switch a chemical in order to burn Nancy, causing her to react violently. Intrigued, Branding later talks with Nancy and gains her confidence. She then asks Nancy if she may hypnotize her and Nancy agrees. Branding places an amulet from antiquity around her neck, telling Nancy that it came from the Carpathian Mountain region and is capable of healing, as well as destroying – and has the ability to release frightening powers. As Nancy gazes at the amulet, Branding hypnotizes her and instructs her to always obey her. Later, Eddie and two local boys, Tab  and Joe , climb up into the girls' room as they are having Nancy’s initiation party. In a nearby building, Branding hears the noise and, despite the distance, is able to re-hypnotize Nancy, turning her into a vampire. The party is broken up by the disciplinarian Miss Rivers , who then sends Nola to the basement to fetch supplies. While in the basement, Nola is attacked by something subhuman and killed. The next morning, as police detective sergeant Stewart investigates the killing, Nancy is unable to wake up until Branding orders her and, when she relates a nightmare she had, Branding orders her to forget it. At police headquarters, the coroner informs Lt. Dunlap  that he found two puncture wounds in Nola's jugular vein and that the body was drained of blood. A young assistant to the coroner, Mike  who shared a room in med school with “an exchange student from a small town in the Carpathian Mountains,” remembers his friend's stories about vampires. Dunlap is unimpressed in the theory. The girls later organize a Halloween scavenger hunt in the local cemetery, and Nancy is again transformed into a vampire and kills another girl, as well as Tab. The police subject all the girls in the scavenger hunt to a lie-detector test, however, Branding is able to alter Nancy's responses to the questions by remote hypnosis. Back at the school, Nancy, confused and frightened by her transformations, begs for Branding's help, but Branding assures her that the experiment will soon be over and that she will be proud of her part in saving mankind from self-destruction. The state threatens to close the school over the unsolved murders, and consequently, Thorndyke asks Branding to take over some of her duties while she attempts to calm concerned parents. Nancy’s boyfriend from back home, Glenn, suddenly arrives at the school, alarmed at the news stories of the slaughters but Nancy acts cold toward him – afraid that she might turn and kill him. Nancy then goes to Branding's laboratory and begs Branding to release her from the experiment and from her power, but the obsessed Branding refuses and hypnotizes her again.

It was the 1980s. Padmasiri or ""Padme"" as known by his colleagues is having a friendly gathering with a mudalali businessman in his village. Padme whilst polishing his shotgun mentions to mudalali, his desire to shoot a fat-bellied man. Mudalali with a laugh tells Padme that it could easily be done by making a visit to the town at night time. Padme then shoots mudalali with anger, shouting only he, himself can have a butchery in town. This marks the beginning of a criminal; a criminal who would later take several lives to fulfil his lifelong ambition; that is to become the grandfather of Sri Lankan mafias. Meanwhile a new inspector of police  was appointed to the village. Unlike previous police chiefs, he was a young, brave and a strict officer of law who would go to great lengths to bring law and order. Soon Padme receives a message to go and visit the new inspector. With anger Padme visits the police station. He was asked politely by the inspector to stop selling illicit liquor. Padme nods with a smile and leaves the station. Next day, the inspector receives an invitation by Padme to come and visit him in his residence. Ignoring warnings and comments the inspector bravely visits Padme, because it was a very polite invitation. After offering some refreshments to the Policemen, Padme takes them to his garden. A car key was handed over to the inspector, mentioning that he always treats well policemen who visits Padme in person. He also mentions that the car itself was bought using money generated through his illicit businesses. The inspector with anger, shouts at Padme in-front of Padme's gang, whilst putting him down on top of the car. With vigour, the inspector yells at Padme to stop immediately all his illicit businesses. He also threatens to set the whole place on fire, if his order is not carried out within 24 hours. Soon after the police jeep left, Padme yells at villagers to make a pile of all cans and containers in front of his house. He then starts making a public speech, criticising the Police department. The news of Padme having a public gathering without permission travels to the Police station immediately. The inspector with several constables decides to visit Padme once again, however armed with firearms. Soon a violent clash occurs between the inspector and Padme, soon after Padme refused to cancel his speech and surrender to Police. The inspector however wins from the clash with Padme. He was put behind bars, soaked in his own blood. Meanwhile Padme's uncle  visits the local member of parliament , someone whom Padme has helped to win the election to release Padme from the Police remand. Soon Padme was bailed-out. The inspector was also transferred to another Police station, however with a promotion. On the day the inspector was leaving the village for good, he pays a private visit to Padme's residence. The ex-inspector advises Padme to stop selling illicit liquor to people and try and become a good person. Padme with a smile praises the ex-inspector, and finally tells him that they promoted him, mainly because the ex-inspector is a valued true hero.  Even though Padme was relieved after the police inspector was transferred, he soon found out that another mafia boss named ""Addarawaththe Lokayaa""  was selling Heroine in Padme's village. A majority of local youth were addicted to Heroine and Padme's men were complaining on a daily basis on the difficulty of finding labour for their businesses. Padme was also approached by many parents in the village to bail-out their sons whom were taken into custody by the Police when caught with drugs. After a series of confrontations between the two, Padme befriends a petty thug in the area named ""Rambo""; in order to kill Lokayaa. Padme's efficient exploitation of Rambo's anger against Lokayaa is evident when the thug was cut into pieces by Rambo whilst walking home alone on a night after visiting a brothel.  Soon after the killing of Lokayaa, Padme was approached by many politicians to kill their opponents. Padme eagerly takes such contracts in order to earn quick money. He did many violent killings under the safety net of politicians. The anti-government youth movement during the time was also blamed for many of Padme's executions. However Padme finds out soon that he cannot protect himself without the help of even more powerful MPs, when Rambo was killed violently by gang maintained by another politician. With hesitation he leaves the local MP who was in the opposition party  and joins a ruling party MP. This however angers the gang maintained by the same MP. It is further revealed at the latter part of the film that Padme was also made a Justice of the Peace  by the MP he works for.  The now defunct gang, previously maintained by the same MP to whom Padme now works for; hires an assassin to kill Padme under the financial backing of a disgruntled social club owner. Disguised as a Police messenger, they ask Padme to report to the inspector in the nearby Police station. Padme then visits the station the next day with his nephew, only to find out that such a message was never sent. On his way out, Padme was interrupted by a youth, dressed in white. After getting the confirmation from Padme of his identity, the young man shoots directly at Padme using a revolver many times, one at his head at and a few at his chest. Whilst Padme's young nephew tries to wake the dead body of Padme, the smiling assassin tries to escape by getting onto his motorcycle. However he too gets shot by the Police. The film ends with Padme's nephew crying at his uncle's slain body. The audience is notified in ending credits that the story continues."

It was the 1980s. Padmasiri or ""Padme"" as known by his colleagues is having a friendly gathering with a mudalali businessman in his village. Padme whilst polishing his shotgun mentions to mudalali, his desire to shoot a fat-bellied man. Mudalali with a laugh tells Padme that it could easily be done by making a visit to the town at night time. Padme then shoots mudalali with anger, shouting only he, himself can have a butchery in town. This marks the beginning of a criminal; a criminal who would later take several lives to fulfil his lifelong ambition; that is to become the grandfather of Sri Lankan mafias.

The following day, Catherine makes the acquaintance of the Thorpe family. She becomes good friends with Isabella Thorpe  and she meets Isabella's brother, John ([[William Beck , when she is reunited with her own brother, James . John flirts with Catherine at a ball, but she is more interested in meeting with Henry and his sister, Eleanor ([[Catherine Walker . Catherine is pressured by Isabella and John into riding to Blaise Castle, despite her having made plans for a walk with Henry and Eleanor. John assures her that he saw Henry driving a phaeton to Wick Rocks, but while Catherine is in John's carriage, she sees the Tilneys walking along the street. Catherine asks John to stop, knowing he lied to her, but he refuses. Catherine runs into the Tilney family at the opera and makes her apologies, before planning another walk. John tells Henry's father, General Tilney ([[Liam Cunningham , that Catherine is the Allens' heir, and the General invites her to spend the day with the family. Catherine is delighted when she learns Henry and Eleanor love books as much as she does. On her return home, Isabella tells Catherine that she and James are engaged. James and John announce that they are to leave Bath for a few weeks and after talking about marriage with Catherine, John leaves believing she is in love with him.

However, he tells Catherine that Frederick will be leaving town soon to re-join his regiment.

A caption reads, ""All of them saw things others didn't see. All of them changed the world."" In the early 1980s, in Soviet Russia, young Misha Galkin is in a public park at night looking at the stars. Suddenly the stars shift into the outline of a cow's head, which turns and looks at him. Moments later, Misha is struck by lightning. A woman examines him and, seeing that he is still alive, predicts that his life will not be ordinary. In present-day Russia, Misha  has grown up to become a high-powered marketing executive working with Bob Gibbons . When Bob's niece Abby  comes to visit from America, Bob warns Misha to keep his hands off the girl, but despite Bob's warning, Abby and Misha drift into a relationship. Misha tells Abby various trivia about the history of marketing, such as that Vladimir Lenin invented modern marketing, and that Communism was the first true global brand. Meanwhile, on a private Polynesian island, a marketing guru named Joseph Pascal  is meeting with the executives of fast food companies. The guru tells them that, to make fast food profitable again, they must change public perceptions of beauty and ""make fat the new fabulous."" An unseen voice-over narrator says that the companies agreed to carry out the guru's plan. In a series of documentary-style flashbacks, narrated by the same unseen narrator, we see how Misha used his natural marketing savvy to rise from a poor clerk to a marketing exec. Misha's big break came when he met Bob, an American hired to spread Western brands and businesses in post-Communist Russia. In the present, Bob discovers Abby's relationship with Misha and is furious. Misha is hired to do marketing for a new reality TV show, ""Extreme Cosmetica,"" in which an overweight girl will undergo extensive plastic surgery to become skinny and beautiful. Everything goes wrong when, after the first operation, the girl falls into a coma. The public turns against the show and the glorification of skinny bodytypes in general, and Misha, as the show's marketer, becomes the scapegoat. He is swarmed by protesters, beaten by police and arrested. When he is released from jail, he angrily confronts his former partner Bob, saying that he's realized the truth: the show and the coma was all orchestrated in order to induce Abby and Misha to split up. Bob denies it  Later, at a bar, they get in a fight, and then, Bob has a heart attack. Full of guilt from the ""Extreme Cosmetica"" girl's fate, Misha realizes that ""his marketing powers are a curse""  and he leaves Moscow and withdraws from modern society. Six years later, Abby tracks him down to a rural community where Misha is living the simple life as a cowherd. While Abby is visiting him, Misha has a strange dream. In a dreamlike state, he performs the Red Heifer ritual, sacrificing a red cow and bathing in its ashes. When he wakes up from the ritual cleansing, he discovers to his horror that he has developed the ability to see strange eel- or blob-like creatures which cling to people's necks and appear to be the embodiment of marketing brand desires. Abby takes Misha to her apartment in Moscow where she reveals that she is rich  and that they have a six-year-old son. In the intervening six years, the ""fat is fabulous"" campaign has changed society, everyone is overweight and images of fat people are used in advertising everywhere. Their son is also overweight and loves ""The Burger"" and other junk-food brands. Distressed by his grotesque visions no one else can see and disgusted by the rampant commercialism around him, Misha impulsively trashes Abby's apartment. Frightened by his behavior, Abby leaves Misha and takes their son with her. Misha develops a plan to fight back against the branding-creatures using their own methods. Going back to his old company, he accepts a job to do marketing for Dim Song, a vegetarian Chinese restaurant chain. At the meeting with the executives, he perceives tentacles growing out of their necks connecting them to the collective Dim Song corporate-branding entity. Using dialogue which parallels Max von Sydow's speech to the fast food executives earlier in the movie, he promises to fix Dim Song's problems. Misha's solution is to cause a fake anti-beef scare  which will frighten people from eating meat, thus turning them towards vegetarian food. The anti-beef scare works, and burger sales drop precipitously. From the rooftop of a building, Misha watches a dragon-like entity hatch from an egg on top of the Dim Song building and fly towards The Burger restaurant, ripping apart and killing The Burger's corporate embodiment. Misha predicts that The Burger will go bankrupt within a week, and his prediction comes true. Back on the Polynesian island, the marketing guru tells the distressed fast food executives that they are in trouble, but there is still a way to save their brands. Before he can tell them his new plan, however, he is vaporized by a bolt of lightning. Misha continues his plan to destroy the world's major brands by using fear-based marketing to make customers afraid of them one by one. In a CG sequence, the brand creatures fly over the city attacking and killing one another: ""Yepple"" killing ""GiantSoft"", etc. Public opinion turns against marketing in general, and the Russian parliament considers a bill banning all advertising. Depressed and alone in his corporate office, Misha leaves a message on Abby's cellphone, asking her for forgiveness. At that very moment, Abby shows up. Suddenly, the building is raided by anti-advertising protesters, who smash through the doors and assault the employees. Misha is struck down while he and Abby try to escape. At that moment, an emergency broadcast plays on TV, saying that Russia and the other nations of the world have agreed to ban all advertising. The protesters stop their rampage, but Misha is already lying on the floor, bleeding from a head wound. Some time later, all advertising has been banned, the Moscow skyline is free of billboards, and bulldozers are crushing old advertising materials in the dump. In the hospital, Misha has awakened with a bandage on his head, and is playing with Abby and his son. In another room in the same hospital, the ""Extreme Cosmetica"" girl awakens from her coma and wanders out into the advertising-free city streets. The voice-over narrator explains that thanks to Misha, the world was changed forever. The camera pans up into the night sky and reveals that the narrator is the cow constellation that young Misha saw at the beginning of the movie."

The pursuit of the American dream becomes littered with pot-holes for the earnest protagonist Ram Patel. Arriving from the airport to stay with a family friend, he finds himself instantly disliked by an African-American landlord  that attempts to make Ram miserable. Pounding the pavement for a job, Ram is taken-on by a CPA firm run by a strict, former military crew-cut martinet who hires other Indian men like Ram to do countless hours of accounting grunt-work in a hot-box dingy office. With no money to save, he begins to borrow heavily and digs himself into insurmountable debt. In the midst of this self-inducedmisery, he sends for his wife & daughter from India and continues his “façade” of a successful appearance to his newly arrived wife by going into even further debt on more newly printed credit cards and “latched-onto” friends. These friends and co-workers begin to get irritated by his lack of commitment to payback, and this leads our protagonist being pressed into self-doubt and constant searching for both “a way out” and purposeful meaning in his life. Proclaiming to push ahead through his frustration and predicament is based more onstubbornness than enlightenment, where a “donʼt quit“ mind-set becomes “fuel- to-the-fire” for his out-of-control situation. Ram has his car stolen, and he becomes enslaved to his increasing debt status, which makes his wife question his responsibility as a husband, father and a man. RAMʼs wife RANI becomes pregnant again, and he must reluctantly send her back to India to deliver their new child due to a lack of medical insurance in the USA. Rani protests, but Ram mentions “financial suicide” as to their status, and Rani goes back to India for the birth of their second daughter. Into the life of Ram Patel comes an eccentric array of characters who swirl his life into confusion. A colleagueʼs mother offers her connection to a spiritual Holy-man known as “DADA BHAGWAN,” whose followers revere him as mentor and benevolent wise master, professing the release of ego for enlightenment. Ram passes up this spiritual growth opportunity, instead trying to make his way on a fortune- seeking venture in a new business with a puffed-up, egotistical entrepreneur named “ADESH.” Ram continues “spinning-his-wheels” and finally tries an introductory session with the eminent Dada Bhagwan. Confronting himself is an intensely difficult proposition, but awareness comes suddenly like lightning and Ram turns over a “new leaf” as the situation begins to eventually swing in Ram Patelʼs favor. This compelling story addresses the overall-immigrant experience of the mid–tolate 20th Century, where “culture- clash” and “making it in America” are the pillars under which many lives are built, or crushed by! The filmʼs ultimate message and Ram Patelʼs plight and subsequent transformation by Dada Bhagwan become the hook whereby any individual can absorb the bracing impact of undeniable fate that results in a firmly entrenched “never-give-up” attitude. Old and young alike will feel a positive, uplifting cathartic reaction to “Desperate Endeavors.

The pursuit of the American dream becomes littered with pot-holes for the earnest protagonist Ram Patel. Arriving from the airport to stay with a family friend, he finds himself instantly disliked by an African-American landlord  that attempts to make Ram miserable. Pounding the pavement for a job, Ram is taken-on by a CPA firm run by a strict, former military crew-cut martinet who hires other Indian men like Ram to do countless hours of accounting grunt-work in a hot-box dingy office. With no money to save, he begins to borrow heavily and digs himself into insurmountable debt. In the midst of this self-inducedmisery, he sends for his wife & daughter from India and continues his “façade” of a successful appearance to his newly arrived wife by going into even further debt on more newly printed credit cards and “latched-onto” friends. These friends and co-workers begin to get irritated by his lack of commitment to payback, and this leads our protagonist being pressed into self-doubt and constant searching for both “a way out” and purposeful meaning in his life. Proclaiming to push ahead through his frustration and predicament is based more onstubbornness than enlightenment, where a “donʼt quit“ mind-set becomes “fuel- to-the-fire” for his out-of-control situation. Ram has his car stolen, and he becomes enslaved to his increasing debt status, which makes his wife question his responsibility as a husband, father and a man. RAMʼs wife RANI becomes pregnant again, and he must reluctantly send her back to India to deliver their new child due to a lack of medical insurance in the USA.

There she meets Dr. Mark Bellows , Chief Surgical Resident, an doctor currently in a relationship with Head of Psychiatry Dr. Agnetta Lindquist . Susan discovers that an unusually high number of surgeries at the hospital have been ending in comas. These coma patients are being transferred to the mysterious Jefferson Institute, a hospital designed to take care of coma patients. It's run by Mrs. Emerson , who refers to the patients as ""her babies"". With the help of Dr. Bellows (and soon Dr. Theodore Stark , Susan investigates the comas, and before long, strange things begin to happen seemingly to stop her investigation: her roommate, who works at the hospital and who helped her access confidential files, is suddenly fired; the hospital board tries to have her expelled from school; and she discovers cameras in her house. She is also stalked by Peter Arno , who turns out to be a patient of Dr. Lindquist's and seems to be stalking Susan at Lindquist's behest. During one encounter with Susan, Peter puts a burlap sack over her head and tells her that, if she doesn't stop looking into the comas, she'll end up at Jefferson too. Soon after a rare tour at the Jefferson, during which Susan wanders off path and discovers inhumane practices such as suspending patients by metal rods inserted into their bones, she contacts Dr. Stark with evidence, but he is in a car accident that renders him comatose before he can expose the conspiracy. Susan and Dr. Bellows, who began suspecting Dr. Lindquist's role in the conspiracy and broke off their relationship, together find out that various hospital staff and doctors have been getting large amounts of money from Jefferson. They further discover that each patient who ended up in a coma was operated on in the same room, which was pumped full of carbon monoxide via a pipe from the basement; this would render the patient brain dead without anyone noticing. Peter tries to kill Susan as she tries to collect evidence, but when he fails, he slits his own throat in a body cooler. Susan is eventually captured and delivered to Jefferson, where they plan to put her into a coma. Susan breaks free, though severely sedated, and tries to escape through the hospital, hallucinating that she is underwater.

Finally she encounters Professor Hillside, her medical school professor, who tells her that he and Susan's late grandfather Dr. Wheeler are the masterminds of the Jefferson Institute, making the Jefferson Institute is her legacy. Susan cries, distraught that this barbarism is being carried out in the name of medical advancement. Meanwhile, Dr. Bellows and police Detective Jackson  both end up at the house of Dr. Stark. There they find most of the doctors gathered for Dr. Stark's memorial; Stark died during surgery a few hours prior. While there, Dr. Nelson, head of anesthesiology and a part of the conspiracy, is seemingly overcome by guilt and tells the detective and Dr. Bellows that they can find Susan at the Jefferson Institute. The police and Dr. Bellows soon enter the institute and witness for themselves the horror. They arrest Professor Hillside and Dr. Bellows discovers Susan, who stabbed Mrs. Emerson to death with a syringe in self-defense and escaped through a drain. The film ends with Susan awake in a hospital with Dr. Bellows by her side. She tells him she had “a terrible dream...I dreamt I was underwater and I couldn't get out”. Dr. Bellows tells her “it was just a dream” and then receives a text message with a picture of Dr. Lindquist, asking him to join her at a hospital in China. Dr. Bellows looks at Susan and repeats, “it was just a dream.”"

When Jimson visits the Beeders, he sees a blank wall in their residence, and is immediately inspired to paint ""The Raising of Lazarus"".

Jimson and Sara struggle for the painting, and in the struggle, Sara falls backwards and knocks herself out. Jimson and Nosey escape the scene. Afterwards, Jimson and Nosey seek shelter in an abandoned church. Nosey then sees the side of the building, a totally blank wall, and points it out to Jimson. Jimson is immediately inspired to execute his largest work, ""The Last Judgement"". Finding out that the church is condemned to be torn down within a fortnight, Jimson, Nosey and Coker recruit local youngsters to help with completing the painting, to the objections of the local council official who is to oversee the building's demolition.

Jimson himself drove the bulldozer, feeling it necessary to destroy the work before anyone else does.

Over the course of the film, it is revealed that Venus has been forced to work at the cafe because its owner, Earl, has taken Venus' Birth Right, a pearl tiara - A magical item that is given to every merperson at birth, and leaves them powerless if it falls in to the possession of another. Diana threatens Earl until he agrees to give up Venus' tiara, but she also finds a large seashell, apparently the Birth Right of another mermaid. Venus realises that the shell belongs to Earl's middle-aged wife, Betty, who has forgotten her mermaid heritage after spending so much time on land. Venus gives the shell back to Betty, causing her to transform back in to her younger mermaid form, and urges her to return to the sea. Betty, however, declines, because she now has a human daughter, Tessa, and instead asks Venus to keep her Birth Right safe. June theorises that Betty now shares her daughter's human soul - an occurrence that only happens when there is love between a human and a merperson - and that she will now have an afterlife, something that other merfolk do not have. Meanwhile, June and Randy are attempting to hunt down and trap Mallick together. At one point, Randy boards Mallick's boat, looking for evidence, but Mallick and Carlo knock him unconscious, and throw him in to the sea. June, however, looks in to the magic mirror that is her Birth Right, and sees that Randy is about to drown. She transforms in to a mermaid, and drags him to shore, leaving him wondering who it was that saved him. It is gradually revealed that Randy is actually unhappy with his girlfriend Cynthia, as the pair have little in common, and Randy soon falls in love with June instead. June then accidentally reveals her mermaid form to Randy, but he is happy. The three sisters then see on the front page of a newspaper that Mallick has discovered the body of their father on the seabed, and is keeping it in a freezer. They confront him, but Mallick has researched mermaids, and knows that they are bound to grant one wish to anyone who asks for it. He tells them to find him a chest of sunken treasure, to which they agree. After they bring him the gold, however, Mallick reveals that he wants to use the three sisters as the main attractions in a theme park. But his plans are ruined when the police arrive at his warehouse, following Randy's tip-off. When the police check the freezer, the merman's tail has transformed back into legs as the freezer is dry. They arrest Mallick on suspicion of murder, despite his protests that the three women are mermaids and the body is a merman. At the end of the film, while Venus and Diana argue over whether they should keep the treasure, June is puzzled by the fact that Randy has started ignoring her again. Venus confesses to June that she used her hypnosis ability to make Randy forget all events of the previous few days in order to keep the sisters' mermaid heritage a secret. June is crushed, especially when she learns that Randy has proposed to Cynthia. Despite this setback, June tells her sisters that she wants to continue staying on land, thinking that there may still be a chance for her and Randy. Venus wants to stay with her, as all her previous time on land has been as a prisoner, and she wants to explore it on her own terms. To the surprise of her sisters, Diana says that she will stay on land as well, so that she can watch over her younger sisters as their father would have wanted. The film ends on the implication that the three sisters will have many other adventures together.
704063{{Plot}} The film begins with many fairy godmothers taking an exam. There is only one male one doing it, after a few hours of unsuccessfully trying to copy the others in order to pass his own quicker. He eventually finishes. The film then takes place three months after the exam concerning the life of an otherwise insignificant park carriage driver and aspiring actor named Oliver Greening . After an accident with his horse, Duchess, he picks up his daughter, Annabel , and son, Charlie , from school, whereupon he must then go to his audition for A Tale of Two Cities. However, the man who watches him respects his work and even though he would like to consider him, he cannot due to his promise to the show's backers of a big name actor in the role. After Annabel attempts to get Charlie to believe that the tooth fairy exists, Murray the fairy godmother  appears after Charlie has gone to sleep. Annabel wants to wish for her father to get the role, but Murray suddenly remembers he is late for an important engagement and promises to return to grant her wish later. That night, Hortence , the head of all fairy godmothers, is holding the annual meeting of the North American Fairy Godmothers Association. All of them appear at the NAFGA home for this meeting. Due to Hortence's rule, all the fairy godmothers must check in their wands before the meeting . Murray arrives late and is therefore locked out of the meeting. Meanwhile, Claudia , a former fairy godmother who has turned into an evil witch, has shown up at the meeting uninvited. After Claudia tricks a receptionist into eating a witch's apple, putting her to sleep, Hortence arrives and orders Claudia to leave. Claudia refuses and unexpectedly casts a spell that turns the head fairy into a paper-thin, two-dimensional version of herself. The spell renders Hortence completely powerless, leaving Claudia free to stuff Hortence's mouth with bricks and steal all the checked wands from her office. Claudia escapes with her accomplice Boots , her pet dog that she has turned into a human, believing she has all the wands... however, she is missing Murray's wand, which was not turned in because he missed the meeting. The next day, Annabel realizes that Murray has left his magic wand behind and decides to return it to him, but Charlie breaks it. She tries to fix it during art class, but fails. She runs out of class and hides when her teacher tries to confiscate the wand, but unexpectedly meets Murray. The two disappear to Nebraska, by way of a misconstrued spell cast by him to get out quickly. After he tries and fails to turn a selfish motel owner they meet there into a giant rabbit ; the two end up back in Central Park. Because of them disappearing in an unexplained way, the school closes early. Charlie finds them. Annabel begs Murray to try to grant her wish now that they are close to her father, but due to yet another mishap by him, Oliver is turned into a statue, Duchess into a mouse, and his carriage into a pumpkin. To fix the problem, the three of them go to NAFGA and ask for the help of Hortence. When they arrive, they find her, who is still under the effects of Claudia's spell. Murray attempts and succeeds at blasting away the bricks lodged in her mouth. She tells them of Claudia's plot and explains that the awry spell must be lifted before midnight, or Oliver will be doomed to remain a statue forever. Claudia, meanwhile, has been looking through the wands, searching for hers. After going through, she realizes it is missing and now belonging to Murray, and is determined to obtain it. Annabel and Murray head to the theater and see Tony Sable, the selfish and conceited actor who is auditioning for Oliver's part. Knowing this could ruin her father's chance of being in the show, she asks Murray to sabotage the audition any way he can. First he tries to make it rain on the stage , but it is dismissed as a simple technical problem and the audition continues. Then she asks him to give Sable a frog in his throat to impair his singing. He takes this wish too literally, and frogs start hopping out of Sable's mouth, shocking the cast and crew. Annabel and Murray celebrate but Sable gets the part since Oliver has not shown up. Boots, who has been looking for Murray, finds them. Murray mentions the story of Brer Rabbit to Annabel and they beg her not to take them to Claudia's lair so she will. Boots is tricked and ""kidnaps"" them, with Charlie following not too far behind with Murray's wand. Claudia catches them, and demands them to tell her where her wand is. She tells Annabel that she will make all her wishes come true. When she refuses to tell her, as punishment, she changes her and Murray into ballerinas and makes them dance uncontrollably. She composes the music and makes it go faster and faster until Annabel agrees to tell her. After a fight over the possession of the wand, Claudia wins but Boots steals it back and gives it to Murray. Out of spite, Claudia turns her back into a dog, then attempts to cast a spell on Murray, but, instead, rebounds on a mirror, drawing her into it: her struggles to escape cause the mirror to fall down, shattering into tiny pieces. Murray, Charlie, and Annabel return to Central Park and restore Oliver just in time. He is given the part of Sable's understudy thanks to a producer who enjoyed his audition . In order to finally grant Annabel's wish, Murray appears backstage and causes Sable to slip on a bucket, and twist his ankle. The resultant temper tantrum gets him fired and Oliver, his understudy, is cast in his place. Charlie and Annabel watch the show with Murray and the other fairy godmothers. The Palace Theatre play  is a success, as Oliver moves the entire audience to tears with his stirring performance, and Murray walks home with Boots .

A spermatozoon-like creature emerges from Spencer's mouth, floating into the void. In an industrial cityscape, Spencer walks home with his groceries. He is stopped outside his apartment by the Beautiful Girl Across the Hall , who informs him that his girlfriend, Mary&nbsp;X , has invited him to dinner with her family. Spencer leaves his groceries in his apartment, which is filled with piles of dirt and dead vegetation. That night, Spencer visits X's home, conversing awkwardly with her mother . At the dinner table, he is asked to carve a chicken that X's father  has ""made""; the bird moves and writhes on the plate and gushes blood when cut. After dinner, Spencer is cornered by X's mother, who tries to kiss him. She tells him that X has had his child and that the two must marry. X, however, is not sure if what she bore is a child. The couple move into Spencer's one-room apartment and begin caring for the child—a swaddled bundle with an inhuman, snakelike face, resembling the spermatozoon creature seen earlier. The infant refuses all food, crying incessantly and intolerably. The sound drives X hysterical, and she leaves Spencer and the child. Spencer attempts to care for the child, and he learns that it struggles to breathe and has developed painful sores. Spencer begins experiencing visions, again seeing the Man in the Planet, as well as the Lady in the Radiator , who sings to him as she stomps upon miniature replicas of Spencer's child. After a sexual encounter with the Beautiful Girl Across the Hall, Spencer has another vision, seeing his own head fall off, revealing a stump underneath that resembles the child's face. Spencer's head falls from the sky, landing on a street and breaking open. A boy finds it, bringing it to a pencil factory to be turned into erasers. Spencer is then seen, in his normal form, in a billowing cloud of eraser shavings. Spencer tries to seek out the Beautiful Girl Across the Hall, but she has began taking other men home. Crushed, Spencer returns to his room, where the child is crying. He takes a pair of scissors and for the first time removes the child's swaddling. It is revealed that the child has no skin; the bandages held its internal organs together, and they spill apart after the rags are cut. The child gasps in pain, and Spencer stabs its organs with the scissors. The wounds gush a thick liquid, covering the child. The power in the room overloads, causing the lights to flicker; as they flick on and off the child grows to huge proportions. As the lights burn out completely, the child's head is replaced by the planet seen at the beginning. The side of the planet bursts apart, and inside, the Man in the Planet struggles his levers, which are now emitting sparks. Spencer is embraced warmly by the Lady in the Radiator, as both white light and white noise build to a crescendo before the screen turns black and silent."

In 1942 Scotland a boy called Angus MacMorrow lives in a large manor house on the shores of Loch Ness with his mother Anne , his sister, a cook, a maid and an old game keeper. Later they are joined by Lewis Mowbray, who comes to work as a handyman in the manor. Angus' father—a sailor in the Royal Navy—is missing since his ship has been sunk in the war. However, Angus is unable to accept that he may be dead. One day, while looking for seashells in the tidepools , he discovers what appears to be a large mysterious egg. He leaves it in his father's shed and returns later to check on it. An unknown creature hatches from it whom he calls 'Crusoe' after Robinson Crusoe, that becomes the fabled Loch Ness Monster. Angus keeps the creature a secret, but eventually tells his sister and  Lewis about it. Lewis explains to Angus that it is a ""Water Horse"" and that it could be a boy or a girl, that it lays one egg, then dies before it can see it hatch. The next day troops of the 12th Medium Regiment Royal Artillery arrive at the house. They are commanded by Captain Thomas Hamilton a friend of Lord Killin, the owner of the house who is serving with the Royal Air Force. An artillery battery is set up near the lake as defence against possible attacking or hiding German U-boats and the troops set up camp on the grounds of the house. An anti-submarine net is also raised at the mouth of the lake to prevent the entrance of German U-boats into the lake. Meanwhile, Crusoe grows so fast that hiding him becomes impossible and eventually Angus has no other option but to allow Lewis to bring it to the lake. Captain Hamilton persuades Angus' mother to allow him to teach Angus some discipline and make a soldier out of him. She agrees but after a few days Angus escapes and returns to the lake where he left his friend. Crusoe lets Angus ride on its back. After some time, it begins to dive underwater, coming to the surface from time to time for breathing. Angus, having aquaphobia, loudly protests that it should stop diving, but later enjoys himself, perhaps even overcoming his phobia for the sea. The peaceful setting doesn't last long; Crusoe suffers from shell shock after almost getting shot by ""Victoria""  aimed at the lake during a firing demonstration. Angus interrupts the demonstration, blowing up the cannon with a bazooka just as it fires to save Crusoe from getting killed. This obviously upsets Hamilton and Angus' mother, who sends him to his room for a month as punishment for causing destructon to their defenses. Two people who previously saw Crusoe while fishing on the lake attempt to take a photo of it in order to become rich. When they realize that they won't be able to photograph the real thing due to the bombardment test, they decide to create an imitation, which results in the real-life faked picture of The Loch Ness Monster, also known as ""The Surgeon's Photo"". The photo, however fake, piques the interest of a few soldiers who venture out on the lake at night to kill it. The surprise attack proves futile for the soldiers, as Crusoe easily capsizes their boat. Angus attempts to calm Crusoe down and wades into the lake where he loses his footing and sinks. Crusoe comes to Angus' rescue and saves his life. After much coaxing from Angus, Crusoe decides to leave the loch for shelter and safety. However, guns from the nearby Artillery battery open fire upon Crusoe, mistaking it for a German U-Boat. Crusoe attempts to jump over the anti-submarine net but instead crushes it with its weight and escapes from the lake also causes all their guns to blow up again. It is implied that Angus finally accepts that his father may never return home while he sees Crusoe's departure from afar, along with Lewis and his family.  After the story was told , a mother calls out to her son, who is walking down the beach and spots a rock. The rock looks similar to the egg that the water horse, or 'Nessie' as known in modern times, had hatched from. The last thing that is heard in the film is a crack from the egg, hinting to the viewers that Crusoe has died, but not before leaving a descendant behind to be the next Nessie."

In Asia’s safest city, the police have long been untouchable. Approaching midnight in Hong Kong, police headquarters receives an anonymous call: a fully loaded police van carrying the force’s most advanced equipment and five highly trained officers has disappeared off the grid. The hijackers possess direct knowledge of police procedures and are already several steps ahead. The police must meet a list of demands to ensure the hostages’ release, including the delivery of a large ransom. Any delay will cost lives. The clock has begun to tick. Rival Deputy Commissioners Sean Lau and Waise Lee fight to take charge of the rescue operation, code named COLD WAR. Lau wants to negotiate with the hijackers while covertly tracking them to their hideout. Lee is ready for an all-out aggressive attack, no matter the cost. For them, there’s much more at stake than the safety of the hostages or the reputation of the police. With the Secretary for Security stepping down, the seat will soon be vacant. COLD WAR will decide who climbs to the top. Lau and Lee are aware that every decision is crucial, that each minute counts. But as they execute a carefully planned attack, they know they’ve become unwitting pawns in a bigger, more dangerous game.

37277581	/m/07k7km1	Mental			74	"{""/m/02h40lc"": ""English Language""}"	{}	"{""/m/07s9rl0"": ""Drama""}"	"Shirley Moochmoore  is a sweet misfit and mother of five daughters who are all convinced they suffer from various mental illnesses. Living in the Australian coastal suburb of Dolphin Heads and married to the often absent local politician Barry , Shirley retreats into a fantasy world of her favourite musical, The Sound of Music. After she manically orders a huge amount of furniture, telling neighbours she won it on a TV game show, she's packed off to a mental institution; Barry instructs his daughters to say she's ""on holiday in Wollongong"". Barry enlists a mysterious, surly hitchhiker named Shaz  to care for his family. Shaz terrifies the girls into obedience with her ocker accent, her dog Ripper and the knife she keeps in her cowboy boot, but she also encourages them to stand up to local bullies including their smarmy Aunt Doris , their snobbish, house-proud neighbour Nancy  and the two mean girls who run the local coffee shop and who had forced Shirley to eat unwanted donuts. Shaz's philosophy is that the 'normal' world is insane, and so-called 'crazy' people are the normal ones. She leads the Moochmore girls on a dawn climb of a nearby mountain. From its peak, they each select a stone to symbolise their newfound ability to overcome adversity. Shaz also encourages eldest daughter Coral  to pursue a romance with Trout , a hunky, guitar-strumming lifeguard at the aquatic theme park where Coral works for an eccentric shark hunter named Trevor Blundell . Trevor had earlier disrupted Trout clumsily kissing Coral in the shark exhibit; but thanks to the confidence Shaz instils in Coral, Trout genuinely falls for her, and the pair spend a romantic evening together riding waterslides in the nude after the park has closed. After forcing Barry to eat a home-cooked meal with his family, and to seek treatment for his daughter Michelle's  genuine schizophrenia, Shaz reunites the Moochmore family at the mental institution. Shirley tells Barry that she knows of his habitual infidelities and will no longer support his political career. Barry begs her to appear at his campaign launch. Trevor reveals that Shaz is actually his mentally disturbed ex-wife. He tells Coral that Shaz is convinced the spirit of their daughter, who died in a boating accident, is trapped inside the giant preserved shark in Trevor's exhibit. Trevor is trying to move on with his life, but Shaz has repeatedly refused psychiatric treatment and instead has followed Trevor to several new towns, working her way into the trust of locals each time. Barry calls the police to have Shaz arrested, and she is confined to the same mental institution Shirley had been. After the Moochmore family perform a triumphant, Von Trapp-style onstage singalong of 'Edelweiss' at Barry's campaign launch, the girls decide to break Shaz out of the mental institution. They tie up Trevor and help Shaz steal his pickled shark. Tortured by the gentle guitar songs of his guard, Trout, Trevor manages to escape just in time to intercept and reason with Shaz as she attempts to free the shark from its tank and 'release' it into the ocean. The shark tank plunges into the water, its attached rope entangling Trevor's legs, and Shaz dives after it, ostensibly to save him. Neither of them surfaces. The girls' aunt Doris, whose hobby is making elaborate costumes for porcelain dolls, has a final confrontation with Shaz in her doll display room. ""I lived!"" Shaz screams, then pulls down her jeans and lights a fart with her cigarette lighter, setting fire to the room and the entire house. Then she races out the front door, kicking over a garbage bin in triumph."

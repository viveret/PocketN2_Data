They go their separate ways and experience many wacky things. After a little while, Bugs comes across Sultan Yosemite Sam's palace in the Arabian desert. Sam needs someone to read to his spoiled brat son, Prince Abba-Dabba . When Bugs first meets the tyke and gets mocked, he objects to the idea of reading to him. Then, Sam threatens to make Bugs bathe in boiling oil, at which point Bugs agrees to read to Abba-Dabba. Bugs tries to escape on a flying carpet from the palace, but Sam catches him. Meanwhile, Daffy stumbles upon a cave of gold and tries to make off with the treasure. But a genie does not like what he was doing and chases him out of the cave. Daffy wanders through the desert and soon sees the palace, hoping to sell books there. Bugs luckily escapes and tries to warn Daffy about the palace, but he would not listen. He found out the hard way and the two walk off with Daffy missing all of his feathers. Most of the rest of the movie consists of the stories played out as classic cartoons. Some of the classic cartoon shorts were abridged. In the One Froggy Evening sequence, the ending where the construction worker from 2056 finds Michigan J. Frog and makes off with him was cut, making it seem as if the cartoon ended with the construction worker from 1955 getting rid of the frog and running off. This was the first Looney Tunes compilation film to use a completely original story and treat the included cartoon shorts as part of the story, as opposed to having the characters introduce the cartoons.

Eventually Rajan moves out to live in a nearby slum area with Rahim in his house. Dr. Bashir Khan is Rahim’s brother and lives in a bungalow next to Rahim’s small house. It's not that Rahim and Bashir are not attached to each other: Bashir has become a doctor thanks to Rahim’s efforts. Rahim wants to spend the rest of life staying in that small house, as this is the house where his wife breathed her last. Its also a practice that Diwan, Rahim and Shardha have breakfast together in the morning and sometimes Kader joins them at Diwan’s house.

Meanwhile Rajan starts loving a fisherman's girl named Shanta.

Jesse is also wounded in the attack, but is able to get a couple shots off at the assailant and save Healy’s life. Healy winds up in the hospital and reveals to Jesse that he wasn’t on a stakeout, but that he was spying on his nephew, whom his mother believes is sleeping with his saxophone instructor. Jesse begins investigating the shooting despite protests from the Paradise town council. The town council members feel that the police department is already spread too thin and are becoming frustrated with Chief Stone. A main concern of theirs, and Internal Affairs, is the six shooting incidents he’s been involved in since his arrival in Paradise. The shooting incident with Captain Healy really ruffles their feathers because he wasn’t supposed to be out “moonlighting” with the state police. They also don’t like that Jesse ran Officer D'Angelo out of the department because he didn’t like him. The town council liked him very much because he wrote three times as many parking tickets as the other officers, and manned the speed trap into the town, bringing in substantial revenue for Paradise. Jesse refuses to have the speed trap manned, because he feels it is unethical, and eventually cuts down the tree that blocks the speed limit sign so the speed trap won’t work anymore. Meanwhile Jesse continues his regular phone calls with Jenn. She is contemplating moving in with Elliot, and Jesse tells her it would be unethical for her to move in with her producer. She hangs up on him. Jesse also continues his therapy, but Dr. Dix seems to be having trouble himself. He visits Jesse at his office and confesses that he misses being a cop. Seeing that Dix is in need of a friend, Jesse offers to buy him dinner. Jesse continues to investigate the shooting of Captain Healy despite being told not to. He questions Gino Fish about the shooting, but gets nothing. He also talks to Sister Mary John, who indicates that it may have been linked to underage prostitution, and gives him three names. Once again Jesse contacts Gino Fish, knowing his distaste for prostitution, and without diming the person out directly, Fish indicates to Jesse that he would focus his investigation on the second name Sister Mary John gave him, Teddy Leaf. Meanwhile Jesse begins sleeping with the Internal Affairs officer who is investigating him, Sidney Greenstreet. He uses his influence with her to get some information on Leaf, and begins following him. When he reveals this to Captain Healy, Healy gets very upset and tells Jesse not to pursue Leaf because he is extremely dangerous. Jesse ignores this and pursues him anyway, threatening Leaf in a bar bathroom. Greenstreet warns Jesse that he had better tread carefully, because she knows how he works: he sets people up. Jesse then gets Leaf to follow him to an apartment with Suitcase's help, and blindsides him. He ties him up in the apartment and anonymously calls the police who then bust him for breaking and entering, and carrying a weapon; both parole violations that get him locked up for a long time. Jesse figures this is better than nothing, since they can’t get him on the shooting.

Also joining them is Matt's sister, and Luke's girlfriend, Kate  and fellow sailor Warren . On the second day of their journey, the yacht strikes a reef and capsizes when the keel is destroyed. With the current taking them further away from land, Luke gathers supplies from the overturned vessel with the intention of swimming to nearby Turtle Island. With the group gathered on top of the overturned hull, Warren activates the yacht's EPIRB, but Luke informs him that it is an older model that requires a plane to fly overhead to receive the signal. When Luke suggests the others to join him in swimming to the island , Warren refuses as he believes the water is shark-infested. With encouragement Kate, Suzie and Matt follow Luke into the water as he begins the journey. During their journey, the group find the carcass of a sea turtle that has had its head bitten off. On the overturned yacht, Warren spots a large Great White Shark circling the vessel. Soon, the group are also stalked by  the same shark. It approaches them several times, even brushing past Kate, before leaving. Kate and Suzie are supported by Matt and Luke as they are both in shock. However, during her encounter, Kate lost the bodyboard she was using as a flotation device. When Matt goes to retrieve it, he is attacked by the shark and his legs are severed. He is comforted by the group, but quickly dies. As night falls, Luke, Kate and Suzie are once more stalked by the shark. Suzie blames Luke for talking the group into swimming to an island he has seemingly lost. In the morning, the group has drifted to a shallow area of the reef, where they are able to stand and rest. In the distance, they can see a larger rock formation protruding from the water, and they swim towards it. Paranoia affects the group as they continue. They share a laugh when they mistake a dolphin for the shark that took Matt. However, the shark soon returns and kills Suzie. Luke and Kate rest on the reef, and they both declare their love for each other. They begin to swim the final distance to the rocks as the shark closes in. Luke assists Kate in climbing to safety, but as he climbs onto the rocks the shark seizes him and drags him beneath the water. The written epilogue reveals that Kate was rescued by a fishing boat the following day, however extensive searches failed to locate Warren or the vessel.

David reluctantly wins his first fight, and Milla becomes more invested in his success . Logan tells David that he will set him free if he wins ten fights in a row. In order to persuade David to fight again, Kaden reveals that Taiga's wife is in their hands and will be killed if he fails to win his next fight. After David wins, it is revealed that his opponent was Taiga, who was given the same task for his wife. Remorsefully, David kills Taiga, but not before incurring serious wounds of his own.

One morning, Renai looks through a family photo album with her son, Dalton , who asks why there are no pictures of Josh when he was a child. Renai reasons that he has always been camera shy. One day, Dalton hears something in the attic and goes to investigate. He sees something that scares him and falls when the attic ladder breaks. The next day, Dalton does not awaken from sleep. Renai and Josh rush him to the hospital, where the doctors say he is in an inexplicable coma. Three months later, Dalton is moved back to his home while still in a coma. Shortly after, disturbing events begin to occur. Renai believes the house is haunted when she begins to see and hear other people in the house. She confronts Josh about the events and the family soon moves to another house. In the new house, increasingly violent and supernatural events reoccur. Josh's mother, Lorraine , contacts a friend, Elise Reiner , who specializes in the investigation of paranormal activity. The family, Elise, and her team enter Dalton's room and Elise sees and describes a figure to one of her two assistants, who draws a black figure with a red face and dark hollow eyes on the ceiling of Dalton's room. Elise explains to Renai and Josh that Dalton has the ability to astral project while sleeping and that he has been doing it since he was very young. The reason that Dalton is in a comatose state is because he has fearlessly travelled too far into different spiritual worlds  and has consequently become lost in a land called ""The Further""—the land is a place for the tormented souls of the dead. While Dalton's spirit is in this other world, he has left nothing but a lifeless body. The tormented souls crave another chance at life through Dalton's state, while the demon has a malicious intent. However, for a spirit to consume a body, a period of time and energy are required. Skeptical at first, Josh later relents when he discovers Dalton had been drawing pictures which resemble the demonic figure Elise described. They run a session to try to communicate with Dalton where the demon uses Dalton's body to fight the group, along with 3 other spirits who want Dalton's body. After the session, Elise calls Lorraine and the two reveal to the couple that Josh also can astral project, and was terrorized by an evil spirit during his childhood. Lorraine shows them pictures from Josh's childhood, revealing a shadowy old woman  going nearer and nearer to Josh in each picture, which explains his fear of photos, and Elise suggest Lorraine to stop taking of photos of him. Elise suggests that Josh should use his ability to find and help return Dalton's soul, to which Josh agrees. Josh projects himself into The Further, finds and frees his son, who had been captured by the red-faced demon. In search of their physical bodies, Josh and Dalton flee the demon that is pursuing them. Just before the two awaken, Josh abandons his son to confront the shadowy old woman who appears to be inside his house. As he shouts for her to get away from him, she retreats into the darkness. Moments later, Josh and Dalton both awaken, just as all the spirits vanish. With the family now happily reunited, Renai, Dalton and Lorraine chat in the kitchen as Elise and Josh pack up from the long night. Josh hands Elise the pictures from his childhood, and as she takes them from his hands, she senses something and takes a picture of Josh. He promptly goes into a rage, claiming she knows that he doesn't like to get photographed, and chokes her to death. Renai hears Josh yelling and goes into the room to find Elise dead and Josh gone. She searches for Josh and comes across Elise's camera. When she looks at the camera, she sees a picture of an old woman. It's revealed that what Elise saw was Josh's old and dirty hand and nails, similar to the old woman's, implying that she has possessed him. Josh then puts his hand on Renai's shoulder, and she is horrified to see what is behind her. After the post-credits, the shadowy, old woman can be seen blowing out a candle."

At the beginning, he is shown welcoming a former teacher into his home, addressing her as Mrs. Vanderhei, and promptly having sex with her. Afterwards, he reminisces about his experiences as her student. In his position as an insurance agent, he is sent to represent his company  at a regional conference in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Lippe is sent as a replacement for his co-worker, Roger Lemke, who dies in an auto-erotic asphyxiation accident. Tim idolized Roger, believing that his death was merely an unfortunate accident, and that he embodied all it was to be decent, honest, caring to the community and most importantly Christian, as these are the key criteria used to judge the winner of the coveted ""Two Diamonds"" award, which Roger had won two years in a row. Tim is under pressure from his boss, Bill, to ensure they win again and keep the small company afloat. Lippe meets fellow insurance agents Ronald Wilkes, Dean Ziegler from Stevens Point, Wisconsin and Joan Ostrowski-Fox, or ""Ronimal"", ""Dean-Z"" and ""O-Fox"" respectively. He also meets Bree, a prostitute who works the parking lot in front of the hotel. She affectionately calls him ""Butterscotch"" after he offers her a piece of butterscotch candy. Initially wary of almost everyone at the conference, he spends more time with Ron, Dean and Joan, and starts to develop genuine friendships and even a crush on Joan. All the insurance agents participate in a Scavenger Hunt, with Tim being paired with Joan, and although no one manages to complete the final task, they come farthest and thus win the contest and a gift card to a local restaurant. Tim, Joan and Dean become rather intoxicated through the night and end up in the hotel swimming pool, Tim and Joan's sexual tension builds to a head and, after making out in the pool, they make love . Regrettably, they were all seen in the pool by ASMI president Orin Helgesson. The next morning, Tim is guilt-ridden and calls his older girl friend  Macy to confess, before desperately asking her to marry him, she takes this opportunity to explain that as a recently divorced woman she just wants to have fun, so she too has been sleeping with other people and tells him that perhaps ""it's time for him to fly away from the nest and start a new life"". Tim returns to Joan, who attempts to comfort him by telling him what Roger Lemke  was really like: that she was his lover but left him after his sexual appetites became a bit too twisted for her, and that he bribed Helgesson for each one of his Two Diamond awards. Tim refuses to believe this, and flees Joan's room, accusing her of being a ""prostitute"" sent to destroy his life. He runs into Dean and accidentally lets it slip that Lemke had bought all of his Two Diamonds. Dean swears to not tell anyone, it becoming apparent that he already sees Tim as a true friend. After some words of advice from Dean, Tim goes to Helgesson for his assessment: it does not go well, and under the pressure he ends up also bribing Helgesson for the award, leaving him penniless and ashamed. He later comes across Bree and accompanies her to a party, which ends up with Tim getting high on crystal methamphetamine and inadvertently starting a fight. Ron, Joan and Dean show up just in time to rescue him, as well as Bree who claims she is in love with Tim. The night ends with Bill appearing at Tim's door to inform him that with the successful acquisition of another Two Diamond award, he has received a generous offer for the company and despite it meaning the branch's closure, he has chosen to sell. The day of the Diamond awards comes and while Bill is formally announcing the sale, Tim bursts in and takes over the podium; this when he reveals that his company has unethically acquired the award every year by bribing Helgesson and confesses to doing so himself. Helgesson flees the room, his reputation in tatters. A furious Bill confronts Tim, his revelations having cost Bill the sale of his company. Tim responds by announcing his intentions to leave the company and start another with his clients from Brownstar, 17 of which have agreed to stay with him. Bill storms off, dumbfounded. As the four friends say their goodbyes and prepare to see each other next year, we see Joan and Tim are happy as friends and Dean invites Ron and Tim to stay at a wealthy friend's cabin in Canada for the summer, both of them surprising Dean by gleefully accepting, their shared experiences having clearly awarded genuine friendships and personal growth to them all. It is revealed during the credits that the three of them went on to start their own company together called Top Notch, with Joan involved as well."

Aaron  joins her. After a short conversation, he orders her to get in his car. She refuses and they fight. Scott , a customer in the diner, intervenes and allows Mallory to escape with him in his car. As they flee, she tells Scott who she is and what's happened to her. These sequences are intermixed as flashbacks with scenes of their flight. Mallory tells Scott that she and Aaron work for a company that handles ""operations."" One week before, the firm's director  Kenneth  attended a meeting in Washington, D.C. arranged by government agent Coblenz . Kenneth's firm was hired to rescue Jiang , who was allegedly being held hostage in an apartment in Barcelona. Also present at the meeting was Coblenz' Spanish contact, Rodrigo . Mallory and her team, which includes Aaron, travel to Barcelona and, despite difficulties, succeed in rescuing Jiang and delivering him to Rodrigo. Back in the United States, Mallory is approached by Kenneth, who insists she undertake what he claims is an easy assignment: pose as the wife of British MI6 agent Paul  during a mission in Dublin. Mallory agrees and accompanies Paul to a party at Russborough House, where they meet with his contact, Studer . Paul meets with Studer again as Mallory watches from afar. She sees Paul go into a barn and after he leaves, she enters it to find Jiang dead, clutching in his hand a brooch which Kenneth had insisted she wear as a recognition signal for her initial contact with Paul. Mallory realizes she has been set up. After returning to their hotel room, Paul attacks Mallory and they fight; Mallory gets the upper hand and kills him. She finds a missed call on Paul's phone and returns it. Kenneth answers and asks if Mallory has been taken care of, before realising that she is on the other end. As Mallory leaves the hotel, she evades Kenneth's agents who are tailing her. Heavily armed members of the Garda Emergency Response Unit appear and try to arrest her. She escapes after a chase and manages to sneak onto a ferry to England. Mallory calls Rodrigo and asks him whether it was he or Kenneth who set her up. This prompts Rodrigo to call Coblenz, who then calls Mallory. Coblenz tells Mallory that he has had suspicions about Kenneth for some time. Coblenz then contacts Kenneth and tells him to inform Mallory's father, John Kane , of her purported crimes. Meanwhile, Mallory enters the United States and reaches the diner, where she was expecting to meet Kenneth. Now on the road, Scott and Mallory are captured by the police. Both are taken into custody but the police are ambushed by Kenneth's men. Mallory manages to kill one of them and flees with Scott in one of the police cars. She releases Scott and leaves to meet with her father. Mallory reaches her father's house in New Mexico before Kenneth, Aaron and two other men arrive to interrogate John about his daughter's whereabouts. After Aaron receives a photograph on his phone of Jiang lying dead, he realizes that Mallory might have been set up. He tries to press Kenneth for the truth, but Kenneth shoots him and escapes as Mallory takes out Kenneth's other men. Aaron apologizes to Mallory as he dies in her arms. The following day, Mallory meets with Coblenz, who reveals that he told Kenneth to contact Mallory's father with the expectation that Kenneth would go to her father's house and she would kill him there. Coblenz also informs Mallory of Kenneth's present location. Before they part, he offers her a government job. She tells him that she will respond to his offer after she finds Kenneth. In Mexico, Mallory confronts Kenneth on a beach and they fight. He gets his foot jammed between two rocks. Unable to escape, he reveals that Jiang was a journalist who was being protected in a safe house after having written a series of articles exposing Studer's crimes. Knowing that Mallory planned to leave his firm, Kenneth arranged for her to kidnap Jiang and deliver him to Rodrigo, who then delivered him to Studer, who killed him. Kenneth then framed Mallory, planning to cut all ties that could lead to him by convincing Paul that Mallory was a double agent whom he should kill. Mallory leaves Kenneth to drown in the incoming tide. A few days later, Mallory locates Rodrigo, who is on vacation in Majorca. The film ends just as she confronts him, presumably intending to eliminate him as the last remaining link in the conspiracy against her."

As they approach the airport the plane short circuits due to an electrical storm but regains power. They find their Swedish business partner, Skyler, has betrayed them and already made a deal with the Russians, using a knockoff application. They go to a nightclub and meet Natalie, an attractive American and her Australian friend Anne. Outside, they witness what appears to be an Aurora Borealis. But some of the light begins to fall from the sky, landing everywhere. The lights then disappear, and when a police officer walks up to investigate he suddenly disintegrates along with many others who were near the lights. The lights are aliens protected by almost invisible force field. They start hunting and killing everyone, sending everyone into a panic. Ben, Sean, Natalie, Anne and now Skyler hide in the club's storeroom for several days. With most of their food gone, the group plans to go to the American Embassy. On the way, they find a police car which Ben and Sean search for supplies while the others hide in a nearby mall. While searching the car, they see a barking dog that gets disintegrated. Ben and Sean hide under the car as the alien moves closer, causing its lights and siren to turn on. The alien moves on and the guys run to the mall. Sean realizes that lights gives the aliens away. The group takes shelters in one of the stores. Sean and Natalie go to look for clothes and they almost run into an alien who can't see them through a glass wall. Sean theorizes that the aliens can only see their electrical charge, but not even through glass. The group finds the American Embassy has been gutted. All except Skyler goes to the roof to get an aerial view. They find a logbook telling them the invasion is worldwide. They also find a radio broadcasting a message in Russian. They hear gunfire and see an alien approaching Skyler. The boys try to save him, but are too late. When the others go outside they see a light in a nearby apartment tower and go to investigate, bringing the radio they found. They find a young woman named Vika and Sergei, an electrical engineer. He made his apartment into a giant Faraday cage that hides everyone from the aliens. He also developed a microwave gun that weakens the aliens' force field so they can actually kill it. Vika and Sergei translate the message; which announces a nuclear submarine is waiting in the Moscow River to take survivors to safety. As Sergei shows the boys the microwave device, Vika, Natalie and Anne go to other apartments to gather supplies for the submarine journey. An alien senses them outside the Faraday cage and gives chase, but Anne hesitates following Vika and goes another way, causing Natalie to follow her back inside. When they get to the apartment, Natalie is unable to close the door and the alien gets inside. Sergei shoots the alien with his gun and finds that it is only stunned. The alien kills Sergei while the others get out by the fire escape, but Anne hesitates again and is killed. Natalie sets the apartment on fire as they climb down and meet up with Vika. They meet up with Russian police who managed to wound an alien with conventional weapons, and Sean collects a piece of it. The police were also able to build another Faraday cage at the local library. The team eventually agree to help the remaining four to get to the submarine. The policemen believe that the aliens are strip mining for conductive metals since giant light columns can be seen drilling all over Moscow. While moving through the subway an alien discovers them and they escape on the tracks. Vika hides behind a pillar, unable to join the others without being seen.

Three teenage boys are holding a knife to the throat of a man. They are demanding his wedding ring, and he is begging for his life. The boy holding the knife says ""he can't do it."" Another boy draws a pistol, says ""God Forgive me"", and shoots him to death. The three boys run out of the house to a getaway car. The scene then cuts to a courtroom. The prosecuting attorney explains to the court that Ms. Smart coerced the boys into the murder of her husband. The scene then cuts to a flashback, where Gregg Smart calls the home of his then-fiancee Pam. He tells her that he got a job at a New Hampshire insurance company, and that she should pack her bags. When he arrives, she notices that he cut his hair, and expresses her disapproval. The next scene shows their wedding. As they are about to drive off, she tells her new parents-in-law that she is thankful that they have been so good to her. Pamela soon applies for a job at a news station, but is turned down. She then gets a job as a media director at a high school, where she begins an Anti-Drug campaign. For the drug campaign, she meets several students, including Billy Flynn and Cecelia Pierce. After the meeting, she drives Cecelia and Billy home, dropping off Cecelia first. When Billy and Pam are alone in the car, they learn of their shared fandom of Van Halen, and Pam says she used to work on a radio station, & met the band then. Later on, Billy, Pam, and Cecelia learn of a contest to make an advertisement for orange juice, which has a cash prize and a trip to Florida. They decide to make a music video for it, Billy being the cameraman. Soon after, Cecelia expresses her interest of going into a similar field to Pam, who offers to let her be her intern. Cecelia accepts, and tells Pam that Billy has a ""major crush"" on her. On one occasion, Pam and Billy go to a nightclub together, despite Bobby's mother's disapproval. One day of filming the music video, Pam asks Billy if she could shower at his house, he says that was okay. Afterward, Billy and Pam talk in his bedroom, & they soon begin to kiss each other passionately. Pam soon pulls away and tells Billy that she's married. However, soon Billy is at his friends house. He tells his friend that his mom believes he is sleeping over there, so if she calls he should pretend he can't come to the phone, but in reality he is going to Pam's and that her husband is out of town. When asked if they plan to have sex, Billy says ""I hope so."" At Pam's, they do end up going upstairs and having sex for the first time. When Pam is driving Billy home one day, she tells him they have to break up. Billy asks her why, and she says that Greg rarely goes out of town like that, and that she wants to be with Billy always. She tells him that the only way they could be together is if he murders her husband. Billy suggests that she divorces Gregg, but she says that all they own is made out to him, and he would get all of it. He also has had a history of beating her, and is afraid for her safety if she leaves him. She tells him that he will also pay his friends $1,000 to kill her husband. On two separate occasions, Billy says he and his friends will kill Gregg, but both times he doesn't, and Pam reacts with anger, and threatens to tell Gregg of the whole situation. Billy tells his friends that he would commit suicide if he lost Pam. On the third occasion, they succeed in killing him. When questioned by the police and media, Pam adamantly claims that her husband was not a violent person, nor was he involved with illegal drugs. Meanwhile, an anonymous caller tells the Police that Cecelia knew about the plot. The police immediately question Cecelia, who eventually admits to the story being true. Billy & his friends are arrested, as is Pam. Billy is offered a reduced sentence if he testifies against Pam, and his friends talk him into it. The movie ends in the courtroom again. The jury finds Pamela to be guilty, and she is sentenced."

The performance, and most of the action in the film, takes place at the palace of one of Beethoven’s patrons, Prince Franz Lobkowitz. Midway during the performance, Beethoven tries to get his lover, a widow named Josephine von Deym, to marry him, but she refuses because of the unfair laws regarding child custody — she is a member of the nobility, and cannot marry a commoner without losing custody of her children. Later, composer Joseph Haydn, now old and feeble, arrives just in time to hear the last movement of the symphony. During the last few minutes of the symphony, the film flashes forward, and we see Beethoven going to dinner with his pupil, Ferdinand Ries, where he is told that Napoleon has just declared himself Emperor of France, thereby completely betraying Beethoven's faith in him. In a rage, he crumples up the title page of his symphony, which he originally intended to call the ""Bonaparte"". As he leaves the performance, Haydn is asked his opinion of the symphony, which he describes as ""quite new"", and then utters his now-famous and prophetic comment, ""From this day forward, everything [in music] is changed"". The film ends on a grim note; as the performance of the Eroica ends, Beethoven looks at his audience and is momentarily unable to hear any natural sounds — an ominous sign of his approaching deafness."

When he shows up on her doorstep, Fiametta does not want to invite him to stay, but her friends, bored and lacking male companionship, override her objections. To entertain the ladies , Boccaccio tells stories of the pursuit of love. Bartolomea  is frustrated by her marriage to the wealthy, much older Ricciardo . The latter's strong belief in astrology dictates how they live. One day, the stars are favorable for fishing. However, a pirate ship appears suddenly and captures the ladies. The captain, Paganino , inspects his prisoners and releases all but Bartolomea. He sends her husband a demand for 50,000 gold florins ransom to be paid at Majorca. By the time Ricciardo shows up however, Bartolomea has fallen in love with the pirate. She denies knowing Ricciardo and, when he is unable to answer a simple question , Paganino's friend, the larcenous Governor of Majorca , orders Ricciardo to pay a fine for his lies: the sum of 50,000 florins. Paganino and Bartolomea get married and he promises to give up pirating. Fiametta is not amused by the ""moral"" of the story, but the others beg Boccaccio for another. Instead, Fiametta decides to recount a more uplifting tale, to her friends' disappointment. Giulio  goads Bernabo  into betting on the virtue of his wife Ginevra . Giulio wagers 1000 florins against Bernabo's 5000 that he can seduce Ginevra within a month. However, Giulio merely bribes the woman's maid Nerina  into letting him hide in her mistress's bedchamber. Later, while Ginevra sleeps, he steals a locket with Bernabo's likeness in it and cuts off a lock of her hair, noticing as he does so a birthmark on her shoulder. When Giulio provides all three as ""proof"", Bernabo pays up. He then recruits two assassins to do away with his wife. The killers are discomfited by Ginevra's lack of fear and let her go. She disguises herself as a man and becomes a sailor on a merchant ship. A potential customer, the Sultan , becomes fascinated by Ginevra's pet talking parrot and agrees to buy the merchant's wares if he can also have the bird. Since the parrot will only speak for Ginevra, she agrees to enter the Sultan's service. Then one day, she spots her locket in a marketplace stall manned by Giulio. Still in disguise, she coaxes the story out of him and finally learns why her husband wanted her dead. She then has the Sultan invite both Giulio and Bernabo  to dinner. Later, with the Sultan and Bernabo within earshot but out of sight, she appears dressed as a woman and asks Giulio if he knows her. When he repeatedly denies it, she is vindicated, and reunited with her husband. Boccaccio does not like the tale, and starts another. Spanish Don Bertrando  is sent to fetch a female doctor, Isabella , for his master, the seriously ill King . On the trip, he has to defend her against two highwaymen. When she is able to cure the King, he offers her anything she wants. She asks for a husband: Bertrando. Dismayed, Bertrando agrees, but immediately after their wedding, he leaves her, as that was all that he had promised to do, and resumes his playboy ways. Before he departs, he tells his new wife that he will only live with her if she obtains the ring on his finger and bears him a child. Determined, she sets out to do just that. Learning that Bertrando is trying to seduce an innkeeper's daughter Maria , Isabella has the aggrieved innkeeper send Bertrando a message supposedly from Maria agreeing to spend the night with him. Instead, Isabella keeps the rendezvous in the dark, unlit bedroom. She later steals Bertrando's ring while he is sleeping and leaves before her deception is revealed. Months later, she gives birth to a son. Bertrando shows up, having heard that she claims the child is his. After she tells her story, Bertrando embraces her. When Fiametta is again critical of Boccaccio's story, he gives up and leaves the villa. However, he returns, takes Fiametta in his arms, and kisses her. She resists at first, then gives in."

The latter's strong belief in astrology dictates how they live. One day, the stars are favorable for fishing. However, a pirate ship appears suddenly and captures the ladies. The captain, Paganino , inspects his prisoners and releases all but Bartolomea. He sends her husband a demand for 50,000 gold florins ransom to be paid at Majorca. By the time Ricciardo shows up however, Bartolomea has fallen in love with the pirate. She denies knowing Ricciardo and, when he is unable to answer a simple question , Paganino's friend, the larcenous Governor of Majorca , orders Ricciardo to pay a fine for his lies: the sum of 50,000 florins. Paganino and Bartolomea get married and he promises to give up pirating. Fiametta is not amused by the ""moral"" of the story, but the others beg Boccaccio for another. Instead, Fiametta decides to recount a more uplifting tale, to her friends' disappointment. Giulio  goads Bernabo  into betting on the virtue of his wife Ginevra . Giulio wagers 1000 florins against Bernabo's 5000 that he can seduce Ginevra within a month. However, Giulio merely bribes the woman's maid Nerina  into letting him hide in her mistress's bedchamber. Later, while Ginevra sleeps, he steals a locket with Bernabo's likeness in it and cuts off a lock of her hair, noticing as he does so a birthmark on her shoulder. When Giulio provides all three as ""proof"", Bernabo pays up. He then recruits two assassins to do away with his wife. The killers are discomfited by Ginevra's lack of fear and let her go. She disguises herself as a man and becomes a sailor on a merchant ship. A potential customer, the Sultan , becomes fascinated by Ginevra's pet talking parrot and agrees to buy the merchant's wares if he can also have the bird. Since the parrot will only speak for Ginevra, she agrees to enter the Sultan's service. Then one day, she spots her locket in a marketplace stall manned by Giulio. Still in disguise, she coaxes the story out of him and finally learns why her husband wanted her dead. She then has the Sultan invite both Giulio and Bernabo  to dinner. Later, with the Sultan and Bernabo within earshot but out of sight, she appears dressed as a woman and asks Giulio if he knows her. When he repeatedly denies it, she is vindicated, and reunited with her husband. Boccaccio does not like the tale, and starts another. Spanish Don Bertrando  is sent to fetch a female doctor, Isabella , for his master, the seriously ill King . On the trip, he has to defend her against two highwaymen. When she is able to cure the King, he offers her anything she wants. She asks for a husband: Bertrando. Dismayed, Bertrando agrees, but immediately after their wedding, he leaves her, as that was all that he had promised to do, and resumes his playboy ways. Before he departs, he tells his new wife that he will only live with her if she obtains the ring on his finger and bears him a child. Determined, she sets out to do just that. Learning that Bertrando is trying to seduce an innkeeper's daughter Maria , Isabella has the aggrieved innkeeper send Bertrando a message supposedly from Maria agreeing to spend the night with him. Instead, Isabella keeps the rendezvous in the dark, unlit bedroom. She later steals Bertrando's ring while he is sleeping and leaves before her deception is revealed. Months later, she gives birth to a son. Bertrando shows up, having heard that she claims the child is his. After she tells her story, Bertrando embraces her. When Fiametta is again critical of Boccaccio's story, he gives up and leaves the villa. However, he returns, takes Fiametta in his arms, and kisses her. She resists at first, then gives in."

The film begins by introducing Sita, a Cheetah in the Masai Mara, in Africa. She has just given birth to five cubs. Although cheetahs are solitary by nature, Sita now has her cubs to take care of, and teach before they each go their own way. Then we see Mara, a six month-old lion cub with her mother Layla, who both belong to the River pride. The pride's leader is Fang, an older lion who has a distinctive broken tooth thanks to an earlier fight. In the North of the Masai Mara, where Sita is caring for her cubs, another pride of lions is led by Kali, who wants to expand his pride by taking over Fang's southern pride. However, they cannot reach the southern pride as they are divided by a crocodile infested river. Sita's cubs are beginning to run and play when Kali and his four sons are on patrol. Sita, seeing it as a danger to her cubs, goads Kali and his sons so as to get them tired and away from her cubs. However after the confrontation, the cubs have scattered. Sita calls for her cubs throughout the night, and as it gets darker, other predators are seen and heard. In the morning, three of the five cubs have returned to Sita. Although she continues to call to them, it is known that the remaining cubs were taken by the hyenas. Meanwhile, Layla is injured by the kick of a zebra during a hunt. As the Wildebeest begin to migrate to greener pastures, so does the River pride. However, due to her injury and her older age, Layla has trouble keeping up.

Again, Sita finds herself having to divert attention so that they do not find her cubs. However, being fellow Cheetahs, they do not tire as easily as lions and soon the brothers have separated Sita from her cubs. As they circle the cubs, the cubs stand their ground and hiss at the bullies, but before the older Cheetah brothers can do anything, a passing Elephant chases them away. Some time later, the river that separates the River pride and the northern pride has lessened enough so that Kali and one of his sons can cross. They head towards the River pride and Fang, seeing Kali and his son approach, runs away. Knowing that Mara would be killed by Kali, Layla stands up to Kali and tries to run him off. Seeing what Layla is doing, the rest of the lionesses fight back against Kali and his son, successfully running out Kali. Fang returns to his pride and life begins as usual for the pride.

They are sharing stories when Beth asks how long it takes to really know someone. Ronny states that you can never really know someone; Nick disagrees. At a car show, Ronny is able to get him and Nick a meeting with Dodge in a few days. They celebrate with dinner with their ladies. While Nick and Geneva are dancing, Ronny tells Beth that he really looks up to Nick, who pulls him onto the dance floor. When they switch partners, Geneva tells Ronny that they love Beth and asks Ronny when he is going to propose to her. That evening, Ronny asks Beth if there’s a clock ticking; she says no, but if things progress, she will not be unhappy. In Detroit for their meeting with Dodge, Ronny tells Nick that he has worked out a deal to get Beth a $20,000 ring for half price if Nick can help by fixing the seller’s car. Nick agrees. In their meeting, they pitch an electric car with the build of a muscle car. Dodge agrees to give them $400,000 for a prototype, and leaves Susan Warner  as their supervisor. She is extremely enthusiastic about working with them. Nick worries that he is going to fail with his engine design; Ronny reassures him. Later, he mentions this to Beth, who is a chef, and asks how he is doing, concerned that he is feeling overwhelmed.  He promises that he is fine then heads to a botanical garden to arrange the proposal. While he is there, he catches a glimpse of Geneva, whom he follows. He walks through poisonous plants and is caught by the manager just as he sees Geneva kiss a young man . He is read all of the horrible side effects of the plants,  and gets kicked out. He later lies to Beth about how he got the rash, and when he re-enacts it, he drops a stack of money, which Beth sees. He lies again saying that he is paying his parts suppliers, which she doesn’t appear to believe. He goes to work to tell Nick, but does not when Nick yells at him. He calls his sister for advice, but she assumes he is talking about her husband, so that fails too. Nick later apologizes, and before Ronny can say anything, Beth and Geneva come to take them out for a break. They go to a Blackhawks hockey game. Geneva goes for beer; Ronny follows and confronts her. She tries to explain, then accuses Nick of getting “massages” every Thursday. She promises that the affair is over, and she will tell Nick once the car is finished. At the office later, Nick inquires about why Ronny’s dragging his feet with the proposal. Ronny tries to probe about possibly getting a massage; Nick feigns ignorance. Ronny later follows him to the massage parlor. He then calls Geneva to apologize, but hears her with the young man, Zip. She tells him to meet her at a diner, where she tells Ronny that she will deny the affair and tell Nick that Ronny has been hitting on her, and revealing a fling they had back in college . She leaves telling Ronny to stay out of her marriage. At home the next morning, Ronny answers a call for Beth, but the caller hangs up. He calls back, and gets the number to a corporate office that is opening a restaurant in Vegas. He later gets a call from Susan, warning him that Dodge has another competitor working on a similar project. Afterwards, he follows Geneva to Zip’s and photographs them together. Kids start skateboarding nearby, so he can’t leave, making him late for Beth’s parents’ 40th anniversary party. When Geneva leaves, he is caught by Zip, and they get into a fight. Ronny fights his way out of the house using hairspray and a candle as a torch...but Zip catches up to him outside, damaging Ronny's car with a baseball bat. He demands to know what Ronny was doing in his house, and Ronny tells him he is best friends with Geneva's husband. He calls Zip garbage for sleeping with Geneva, and then leaves as Zip starts to cry. Ronny cleans himself up then heads to the party, where he makes a long, inappropriate speech about honesty, secretly aimed at Geneva, who is also in attendance. Beth takes him aside and begs him to be honest with her, so he asks about the Vegas restaurant. She explains that she was offered a job, but declined because she does not trust him in Vegas. He leaves and spends the night at the office. He goes back to Zip’s to get his camera. Zip answers the door with a gun, and insists that Ronny come in, because he read that he could legally shoot someone in self defense if they enter your home. Ronny refuses to enter, and Zip starts crying again about Ronny killing his fish, due to the fact that Ronny accidentally destroyed his fish tank during their fight the other night. He demands that Ronny give him $10,000 for damages, but settles for $1000 and an apology and gives him back his camera. Nick arrives after Ronny leaves, having followed him there suspecting Zip was a bookie, and Ronny was borrowing money for gambling. Ronny goes back home to find Beth, Nick, his sister, Geneva, and his gambling sponsor holding an intervention for him. Zip shows up seconds later, claiming to be his bookie. Ronny lashes out at him and hits him. When Zip leaves, Ronny explains that he is not gambling, he is been acting weird because he found out a week ago that Geneva was having an affair with Zip and did not know how to tell Nick. Surprisingly, Geneva admits the affair. Ronny also confesses to the college fling. Nick is outraged and leaves. Ronny comes home later after going for a walk. He tells Beth he brought her something to eat and they apologize for not trusting each other. She opens the bag of food and finds an engagement ring inside, and accepts his proposal. At the meeting the next morning, Nick tells Ronny he moved out, then hits Ronny twice for not telling him the truth. He makes Ronny promise to be honest even if it hurts. They make up and head into the meeting, where Nick unveils the prototype car. Through his extensive research and tuning, he was able to make the new eco-friendly Dodge Charger sound and perform just like the classic 1968 Dodge Charger. Dodge is impressed with the prototype and give Nick and Ronny the contract. At a Chicago Blackhawks game some time later, Nick finally gets a chance to try a challenge he always claimed he could do. He fails twice, but on his third attempt, Ronny gives Nick the coach's dramatic speech from the film Miracle, and he gets the puck into a net, winning a chance to go to an all-star game. Ronny runs onto the ice to celebrate with him before they are both escorted off.

Jamie has the task of trying to recruit Dylan to interview for a job with GQ magazine and begin working in New York City. Dylan comes to New York and after interviewing for the position learns from Jamie that he has been given an offer to work for GQ. At first Dylan is hesitant to accept and move from Los Angeles to New York, but in an effort to get Dylan to accept the job Jamie spends the evening taking him around the city trying to sell him on the opportunity and the city. After a fun night together exploring the city Dylan agrees to take the job. The next day Jamie presents Dylan with the contract to sign so she can land her commission for recruiting him. Not knowing anyone else in the city, he and Jamie quickly develop a strong platonic friendship. One night, while hanging out at Jamie’s apartment watching a romantic comedy, they get on the topic of sex and relationships. They come to the conclusion that sex should not come with so many emotional attachments. As they both feel the need for a physical connection, they agree to have sex without emotion or commitment. After several trysts together Jamie comes to the realization that this isn’t really what she wants and she would like to start dating again. She informs Dylan that they need to stop. Jamie meets Parker  and they begin dating. After five dates they consummate their relationship but the next morning Parker leaves and informs Jamie that he can't be the 'Prince Charming' she wishes for. Furious, Jamie tells Parker off, assuring the end of their relationship. Trying to be sympathetic and to help Jamie get over the pain of the situation Dylan suggests she come with him to California over the Fourth of July weekend while he visits his family. Jamie is very hesitant, but agrees after much persistence from Dylan. They fly to California where Jamie meets his sister Annie  and father . While in California strong emotional romantic feelings for each other begin to form and they share a passionate kiss, which leads to a night of close intimacy unlike any they had shared before. However the next day Jamie overhears a conversation between Annie and Dylan where Dylan claims he has no real feelings for Jamie. Hurt, she flies back to New York. A few days later Dylan returns to New York trying to reconcile his friendship with Jamie and find out why she has been ignoring him. He finally finds Jamie and she informs him she overheard everything he said and has no interest in maintaining any kind of a friendship with him. Soon after this Jamie discovers that Dylan may be leaving the GQ position for another job before the year elapses on his contract, which would affect her commission. She confronts Dylan about this which leads to another argument. Both begin to do some soul searching trying to come to terms with their feelings about their relationship. Jamie spends time with her mother , while Dylan discusses it with his sister over the phone. His sister informs him that their father, who suffers from the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, will be flying to Newark and he needs to be picked up at the airport. While eating at the airport with his father, his father, in a moment of Alzheimer's-induced confusion, incorrectly recognizes a passerby as a woman from his past. Dylan asks him about this woman, and his father, upon regaining his lucidity, says that she was a woman he met in the Navy, that she was the love of his life, and regrets decisions he made in his youth to let her go. He tells Dylan not to let the same thing happen to him, and to go after the woman he loves if there is any chance of saving the relationship. Dylan realizes how he really feels about Jamie after this talk with his father and decides to go after her. He calls Jamie’s mother to set up an excuse to get Jamie to go to Grand Central Station thinking she will be picking her mother up and arranges to have a flash mob scene set up to surprise Jamie at the station. When the moment comes he catches up with Jamie and tells her how he really feels. Surprised and happy by this turn of events Jamie tells him to kiss her. After sharing a passionate kiss, Dylan suggests it is time they go on their first real date. They go to the Pershing Square café across the street, and although they attempt to keep the date casual and relaxed, the film ends with them in a sensual embrace and passionate kiss.

27698998	/m/0c3_f3n	Mantrikacheppu	1992			{}	{}	"{""/m/05p553"": ""Comedy film""}"	"The movie begins with a mysterious figure, Dr. M2, rallying a group of robots that he calls Death Machanics . He orders one of the units, Death 18, to kidnap Kiyomaro. Meanwhile, Kiyomaro is rushing to get to the bus for Coast School, since he slept in late. He leaves Gash behind, who chases after Kiyomaro. During the chase, Vulcan, who Gash brought along with him, is partially broken. Stuck in a tree and unable to stop Kiyomaro, Gash asks him if he'll at least fix Vulcan, but Kiyomaro says that he'll ""make him a new one"". As Kiyomaro tries to chase the already-moving bus down, his friends spot him and try to tell the others to stop the bus. However, while they're not paying attention, Death 18 swoops down from the sky and abducts Kiyomaro, carrying him away and leaving his friends baffled. Once Kiyomaro arrives at Dr. M2's lab, he is contained inside an orange bubble. Dr. M2 then orders Death 18 to go down and distract Gash to keep him away from Kiyomaro by making Gash think that he's his friend. As Gash walks home, he thinks about the previous versions, or ""generations"", of Vulcan that had been ruined in the past , and how they are all important friends of his. Screaming out that Kiyomaro's an idiot, Naomi, the local bully, believes that Gash was talking about her, so she starts pummeling him. However, Death 18 comes down from the sky and interrupts her. As he's about to harm Naomi, Gash realizes that he looks just like Vulcan, and tells him not to hurt Naomi. Naomi runs off and Death 18 fixes Gash's Vulcan. Gash thinks that Death 18 is another Vulcan that Kiyomaro built, and calls him ""Yondaime"", or ""Fourth Generation"". Gash and Vulcan then ride in Yondaime's giant mouth into town. In Dr. M2's lab, the demon explains that Kiyomaro is to be his new partner, and that he can take Kiyomaro to the future demon world. Dr. M2 shows Kiyomaro the Death Mechanics, but Kiyomaro tells him that they're just rip-offs of Vulcan. To prove him wrong, Dr. M2 shows Kiyomaro a robotic model of Vulcan from the future that Kiyomaro will someday build; however, as a prototype, it's loaded up with bugs. Dr. M2 had realized that the best way to fix the Death Mechanics was to have Kiyomaro repair them. Kiyomaro asks Dr. M2 whether the battle to decide the next ruler of the Demon World is still going on, but Dr. M2 simply states that he isn't interested in that battle, leaving it vague. Dr. M2 offers again to bring Kiyomaro to the future, but he refuses. Dr. M2 tells him that the idiots of his time can't understand him, but Kiyomaro says that Gash changed his view of people around him. Meanwhile, after venturing into town, Gash and Yondaime go under a bridge and find graffiti. As the two start painting the walls themselves, Gash paints ""Yondaime"" in Kanji onto the robot's body. Gash's demon friends, Tio, Kanchome, and Umagon, then arrive under the bridge. While Kanchome is terrified by Yondaime, Gash explains that he is a present from Kiyomaro, so the five of them then play together in the park. As Dr. M2 opens the portal to the future to return with Kiyomaro, a dark cloud is created over the city. Citizens of Mochinoki Town are advised to leave, and there is mass panic. Gash says that they should all go to investigate, but Yondaime's programming makes him try to keep them all away. After much prodding from Gash, though, Yondaime realizes that he and Gash have become friends, and he changes his mind. The four demons get into Yondaime's mouth and, revealing that he can fly, Yondaime soars towards the cloud. Upon entering the dark cloud, they discover Dr. M2's giant floating castle. Infuriated that Death 18 disobeyed his orders, Dr. M2 tries to reprimand him, but the robot doesn't respond. Kiyomaro manages to break free from his prison and communicates with Gash using a giant monitor on the side of the castle. Dr. M2 summons all of the Death Mechanics to fight off Gash and the others, but Kiyomaro manages to get Gash to fire his Zakeru spell, blasting away the Death Mechanics' missiles. The attack also tears a hole in a part of the castle, though, leaving Kiyomaro to fall from the sky; however, Yondaime manages to catch him. Kiyomaro gets ready to attack the army of Vulcans, but Gash, believing them all to be Vulcans and, therefore, all his friends, runs towards them to try to talk to them, while Yondaime keeps Kiyomaro restrained. The Vulcans don't respond to Gash's words, though, and all begin to pummel him. Tio, Kanchome, Umagon, and Yondaime all try to hold back the Vulcans from attacking him, but to no avail. As all of the Vulcans try to take Kiyomaro, Gash yells at them to stop. They all stop momentarily, but are immediately called back to the castle by Dr. M2. One of Dr. M2's lightning bolts hits Yondaime, reverting him to his original programming. Despite Gash's efforts, Yondaime flies off to join the others, who all fuse together with the castle to become one giant Vulcan. As the giant Vulcan attacks the group, Megumi, Folgore, and Sunbeam all arrive in a car together to help fight it off. During the scuffle, Megumi casts Giga Ra Seushiru, causing the giant Vulcan's attack to reflect back at it, making it collapse. Gash asks again if they can stop attacking, saying that since they're all Vulcans, they're all his friends. Kiyomaro angrily snatches Gash's Vulcan from his hand, saying that it's just a toy made from chopsticks and a paper box that he scrapped together. Gash tearfully reminds Kiyomaro that Vulcan was the first friend that Kiyomaro ever made for him. Shaken by Gash's statement, Kiyomaro says that the only reason he wanted to go to Coast School was because his friends would be there. Kiyomaro had been alone, thinking that the world was boring and stupid, until Gash had come along and taught him the importance of friends. Kiyomaro comes to tears as he says that, although Gash made many friends for Kiyomaro, the only friend that he could give Gash was a toy made of paper box and chopsticks, yet Gash still cherishes it so much. Everyone agrees that, because Vulcan is Gash's friend, he is their friend as well, and will help protect all of the Vulcans. With newfound understanding and determination, Kiyomaro comes up with a plan to stop the Vulcans without destroying them. The four demon and human pairs coordinate attacks and trick Dr. M2 into opening the power reactor on the front of the enormous Vulcan to attack; however, before he can, Gash and Kiyomaro jump in the way and fire Zakeruga at the reactor, destroying it. When the giant Vulcan collapses, Gash sees that Yondaime is all right, and he hugs him. Suddenly, the storm around them intensifies, and everyone realizes that if they don't seal the time-space hole, then the entire Earth will be destroyed. Kiyomaro grabs Dr. M2, asking him to fix it. Dr. M2 reveals that if the destroyed reactor is fixed, the hole will close, but there would need to be a large amount of power to reactive it. Gash states that they could provide the power to activate the reactor, and Dr. M2 realizes that everyone's combined power could repair it. As Dr. M2 floats in the sky in the core of his castle, the four demons cast a series of spells to channel power into the reactor, ending with Kiyomaro casting Gash's most powerful spell, Baou Zakeruga, to guide it. However, their efforts are unsuccessful, and the temporarily closed gate opens once more. Yondaime then flies up, attaching himself to the reactor. Dr. M2 realizes that Gash could strike the reactor still active in Yondaime to get the main reactor working again, but Gash says that he could never shoot Yondaime. As Gash cries, Yondaime begins talking to him; however, the one sending the message through Yondaime it is in fact the Vulcan prototype, which is revealed to contain Kiyomaro's recorded voice. He says that they will always be friends, whether they are together or apart; he speaks not only as Yondaime, but also as the future Kiyomaro who no longer has Gash with him. Redetermined, Gash and Kiyomaro launch a gigantic Baou Zakeruga, which crashes through Yondaime and splits into three heads, starting up the reactor. As Dr. M2 sits in the castle, holding the prototype Vulcan in his lap, he quietly wonders to himself if the transmission element that Gash and Kiyomaro used to guide the reactor can guide even himself. The three Baou Zakerugas fly into the cloud, successfully closing the hole and leaving Dr. M2's fate unknown. The giant Vulcan then separates back into the smaller Vulcans, who fly away into the sky. Gash asks Kiyomaro if he can ever see Yondaime again, but Kiyomaro responds that he'll build him an even better Vulcan; an even better friend."

Charlie Kenton  is a former boxer who owns such a robot, Ambush, competing in unsanctioned matches and in exhibitions with it. At a rural fair, Ambush is destroyed by Black Thunder, a bull belonging to promoter Ricky . Having made a bet that Ambush would win, Charlie now owes Ricky $20,000, which he doesn't pay before leaving. Charlie is informed his ex-wife has died, and that he must attend a hearing to decide the fate of his preteen son Max . Max's wealthy aunt Debra  and uncle Marvin  want full custody, which Charlie gives them in exchange for $100,000, half in advance, on the condition that Charlie take care of Max for three months while the couple are away on a second anniversary. Charlie and Max meet with Charlie's childhood friend Bailey Tallet , who runs the boxing gym of her deceased father, Charlie's old coach. There, Charlie buys a secondhand World Robot Boxing league  robot, the once-famous Noisy Boy, and arranges for it to fight the illegal circuit's champion, Midas, at a venue belonging to his friend Finn. The fight starts well for Charlie, but partly due to both his inexperience with Noisy Boy's combinations and his own overconfidence, Charlie ends up losing control of Noisy Boy and Midas destroys it. Charlie breaks into a junkyard with Max to steal scraps that he can use to put a new robot together. There, Max falls over a ledge, where he is saved from doom by getting snagged on the arm of a buried robot. After Charlie pulls Max back up, Max digs out the entire robot, called Atom. On Max's insistence, Charlie takes it back to Bailey's gym, where they discover Atom is an obsolete Generation-2 sparring bot built in 2014. Atom has been designed to sustain massive damage, but is unable to deal much damage itself. Atom also has a ""shadow function"" which allows for following human movement. Partly due to both Max's insistence and Charlie needing money, the duo has Atom fight an unsanctioned outdoor match against a robot called Metro. Atom wins, earning back some of Charlie's money. Max later upgrades Atom to take vocal commands, using parts from Charlie's demolished robots, and convinces Charlie to train Atom. Atom's string of subsequent wins attracts the attention of a promoter from the WRB, who offers Atom a professional fight against the robot Twin Cities. Charlie accepts, and Atom wins again, thanks to Charlie's boxing experience allowing him to locate and take advantage of a small tell in Twin Cities' punch. Reveling in their subsequent novelty attention, Max challenges WRB champion Zeus, designed by genius Tak Mashido  and sponsored by wealthy Farra Lemkova , a woman who is shown to monopolize the robot-boxing industry, who before the match tries to buy the upstart Atom. As Max and Charlie leave after the Twin Cities fight, Ricky and his men attack them, and steal their winnings. Feeling guilty, Charlie returns Max to his aunt and uncle, feeling Max will be safer with them and refusing the second half of the money he was promised. Bailey convinces him that he can be a better father. Debra allows Charlie to take Max out for one last night, to the Zeus-Atom match. Zeus severely damages Atom while also getting injured for the first time. Ricky, who had bet Finn $100,000 that Atom would not last the first round, tries to slip away, but is cornered by Finn and his colleagues. In the fourth round of the five-round match, Atom's vocal receptors are damaged, and Atom must fight the last round in shadow mode, copying Charlie's moves from the aisle. Zeus, now controlled manually by a furious Mashido, expends energy on trashing the defensive Atom, running low on power and turning sluggish as a result. The fight swings in Atom's favor as he overwhelms the weakened Zeus, even knocking the seemingly invincible champion down once, but Atom is unable to win before the round ends. The judges declare Zeus the winner on points, but the near-defeat leaves the Zeus team humiliated. The people cheered for Atom, who is labeled the ""People's Champion"" as Charlie and Max celebrate their success and their love."

Gotō goes to deliver a package to Yuriko Niimi , the daughter of the president of Energy Bio Corporation. Meanwhile, Fuyuko Todoroki  orders a cappuccino from coffee shop employee Akira Tanada . They talk before she has to leave to meet with insurance salesman Yukio Tomizawa  downstairs. As Mashiko and Iio start cleaning, Tanada apologizes for giving security center employee Shūji Yamagiwa  and new security manager Shinichirō Okanaka  the wrong order. At 3:00 p.m., a disguised man with a rifle informs everyone that he and his allies have hijacked the building and set up a bomb that will go off in ninety minutes should President Niimi  not arrive with the ransom. Before she is locked in with Tomizawa, Fuyuko and the rest of the hostages in the fifth floor lobby, Yuriko runs off with Gotō running after her. At the police station, Niimi and chief detective Genji Morozumi  keep in contact with a hiding Tanada. Meanwhile, Yuriko quickly collects company data worth more than the ransom money. She reveals how she believes her father will only come to save his company. In turn, Gotō reveals his own past of how his trusted friend died ten years ago. They cut off the power, which allows most of the hostages to escape the lobby. Okanaka distracts the hijackers to give Yamagiwa the chance to open the B-1 doors on the second floor for the hostages to escape the building after the power returns. Tanada informs the police that the basement doors are open, and Mashiko chooses not escape with Iio. After the escaped hostages manage to get outside, Gotō tells Yuriko to go while he tries to take down the hijacker chasing after them. The doors close in front of Yuriko, who stops when she hears a gunshot and sees Gotō collapse; the hijackers take her away. Meanwhile, as the only two still trapped in the lobby, Fuyuko reveals to Tomizawa that her father died taking a drug handled by Niimi's company just before she is taken away as well. After administrating a background check, Morozumi finds out that the phone number Tanada has been using belongs to a young man who died ten years ago. The hijackers take Niimi, who went in the building with the money, to the security room, where Yamagiwa, Okanaka, Yuriko and Fuyuko are tied up. One of the four hijackers in the room informs Niimi that all they want is for him to publicly admit that his company handled lethal medicine that killed their friend and Fuyuko's father. The hijackers reveal themselves to be Mashiko, Tomizawa, Tanada and Gotō. Okanaka knew that there were only a total five hijackers, with Yamagiwa being the fifth one who oversaw the operation. Although Niimi initially refused to admit that he distributed the drug while knowing the risks, he relents and Yuriko decides to stay by her father's side. Niimi apologizes to her and then confesses to the media. After Okanaka agrees to erase the security data of their kōhai, who helped the five before the switch during the hostages' escape, the five escape through the air vents and into the basement. However, Mashiko realizes that he does not have the car key, only to find that Iio had left it on the car for him. At a distance from the building, the timer reaches zero and the bomb turns out to be an explosive for fireworks instead. Finally able to move forward, Mashiko, Tomizawa, Tanada, Yamagiwa and Gotō readily surrender themselves to the police.

The man calls home, and tells his son not to let anyone in, but the boy says 'they're already here, and they shot mum'. In a seemingly unrelated scene, Jaime, his wife Marta, and their daughter Isa have just moved in to a new home. Isa has plans to attend a party with a boyfriend, César. As she prepares for her date, Marta and Jaime are arguing about how to raise their daughter. Before they can settle their argument, three masked men break into their home and take them all hostage. They are Head Thief, Young Thief, and Strong Thief -- three of the men from the moving crew. Head Thief takes Jaime to a bank machine several miles away from home, while the other two stay with mother and daughter. As Jaime begins to withdraw money from every account the family has, tensions are beginning to arise between Young Thief and Strong Thief, back at the house. Strong Thief seems to have no conscience, while Young Thief is more sympathetic to the fate and feelings of Marta and Isa. Head Thief tells Jaime that if there is any deviation from the plan , or if he tries to alert anyone to his predicament, Head Thief will call the house and have the other two invaders kill Marta. Jaime takes the risk, and tries to convince a woman at the bank machine to call the police, but she believes he's trying to rob her, and gives him all her money. This causes Head Thief to call the house and tell Strong Thief to do whatever he wants to Marta. Jaime, hearing Marta's screams over the phone, begs Head Thief to give him another chance. Head Thief agrees, and after telling Strong Thief to leave Marta alone, he takes Jaime to another bank machine further away. Meanwhile, at the house, César comes to pick up Isa for their date. Young Thief and Strong Thief pull him into the house, and find that Marta and Isa have fled to the basement and locked themselves in a back room. The men drag César downstairs and threaten to kill him unless the women open the door. They don't, so Strong Thief shoots César and breaks into the room with a sledgehammer, taking the women hostage again. While guarding the women, Strong Thief has a snack and watches television, cranking up the volume. A policeman comes to the door to say that the neighbours have complained; he asks if he may come in and look around. Young Thief pretends to be Marta's husband, in order to convince the officer that everything is all right. The officer grows suspicious, and Strong Thief slits his throat. Strong Thief decides to rape Isa. Marta offers herself in Isa's place, but Strong Thief laughs and breaks Marta's arm, instead. He takes Isa to a bedroom , while Young Thief tries to make Marta comfortable.. Young Thief, disgusted by the death and pain that's happened so far, pulls Strong Thief off of Isa. The two men fight, and Isa flees deeper into the house. Strong Thief ties up Young Thief and leaves him with a handcuffed Marta, then goes after Isa. When he tries to rape her again, she grabs a statuette and uses it to crush his head. While this is happening, Jaime and Head Thief are in the car, driving around. The idea is for the clock to turn to the next day, so that Jaime can take out more money from the bank. Instead, Jaime speeds up and runs the car into a telephone pole, knocking himself and Head Thief unconscious. When Jaime comes to, he takes Head Thief's gun, then returns home to find Isa in the hallway, covered in Strong Thief's blood. Jaime and Isa go to the basement and release Marta and Young Thief.

Anqi entered Botak's life when he was a young boy, when Yue Feng sought refuge with Botak's mother after she could no longer stand physical abuse by her husband. This resulted in Anqi  often being teased as being fatherless by another childhood friend, a bully yet coward to stronger forces, Ma Linfan  , son of parents who ran an illegal betting syndicate. As children, Anqi, Ma Linfan and 'African'  ([[Victor Wong , often competed playing marbles  or fighting fish with each other. Anqi always won these games. After losing a game, Ma Linfan teased Anqi. She became angry and beat Ma Linfan, thus giving her a strong, fierce personality. Because of this, Anqi was given the nickname Fighting-Fish. Whenever she was upset, she would eat ais kacang  together with Botak, or idle away by the river chatting with him. She would always say that when she grew up, she would return to Penang to look for her father and move to a faraway place, which Botak desired not to realise. As a 20 year-old something adult, she was in a cold relationship with her mother, blaming her being estranged from her father. Ma Linfan, frustrated at losing to Fighting-Fish each time in fighting fish duels, decided to steal hers, but was caught red-handed and escaped. The second time, which could have been a success, he ended up with a tussle with Fighting-Fish, which had her brushing against him on the lower bodies, causing him to have an erection. Because of this, he believed that he fell in love with Fighting-Fish and went to great lengths to win her love. Ma Libing  , the younger sister of Ma Linfan, was secretly in love with Botak. Throughout the story, Ma Libing was a quiet girl and was often seen holding a packet of iced barley drink  whenever she went. She chanced upon Botak's love letter to Fighting-Fish in her brother's room. She became upset after reading the letter and sought to win his love with even more determination. The letter somehow ended up with Yue Feng, who then knew of Botak's secret admiration of her daughter and later discovered Botak's portraits of Fighting-Fish in his room. After a heated quarrel with her mother over her disapproval of her wanting to marry another man, Fighting-Fish travelled to Penang to look for her father with Botak. They arrived at her old home at Chew Jetty , a neighbourhood of wooden houses on water, occupied by Chinese families with the surname Chew , only to discover that her father  now operates an illegal gambling den and had remarried with a 5 year-old son and an unborn child. The reunion was disrupted with a raid by the police. Botak, Fighting-Fish and her father managed to escape, but she realized the predicament that her mother was in 10 years ago. She sought to mend ties with her and expressed her desire to further her studies in Singapore. Botak went after her on the day of her departure, bringing a packet of ais kacang and the unread love letter. During the journey, he was met with two accidents but was only bruised from head to toe. He handed the packet to Fighting-Fish, moving her to tears . In the haste, Botak also forgot to hand the letter to her and left the scene drenched from rain. Botak's younger sister submitted one of Botak's portraits to a drawing competition, which won the first prize, even appearing in newspapers. When Botak found out, he ran away in tears, unwilling to embrace the fact that he had hesitated to confess his love to Fighting-Fish. Towards the end of the scene, all of the young characters had left the town, each on their own career paths. The final scene showed Botak, now older and with a girlfriend, at a pedestrian crossing in Kuala Lumpur, not knowing that Fighting-Fish was also nearby. They both walk away in different directions.

Much to the dismay of his mother Rose , his father Ted  buys the colt at auction, despite a friend pointing out a more suitable plough horse for his farm. Desiring to spite his landlord Mr Lyons , and retain his pride, Ted bids higher and higher for the colt. The high cost of the horse (30 [[Guinea  means he is unable to pay rent to Lyons, who threatens to take possession of the farm if the money is not paid by autumn. Ted promises to meet the deadline, suggesting he could plough and plant a lower, rock-filled field with turnips. Albert names the horse Joey and devotes much time to training him. Albert's best friend, Andrew Easton , watches as Albert teaches his colt many things, such as to come when he imitates the call of an owl by blowing through his cupped hands. Ted, who has a bad leg from a war injury, is frequently shown drinking alcohol from a flask he carries. Rose shows Albert his father's medals from the Second Boer War in South Africa, where Ted served as a sergeant with the Imperial Yeomanry. Ted was severely wounded in action, and received the Distinguished Conduct Medal for bravery under fire. She gives Albert his father's regimental pennant, telling Albert that his father is not proud of what he did during the war, and that he had thrown the flag and medals away, though Rose saved and kept them hidden. Albert trains Joey for the plough and, to his neighbours' astonishment, prepares a stony hillside field to plant with turnips. However, a rainstorm destroys the turnip crop, so Ted, in order to pay the rent and without telling Albert, sells Joey to the young cavalry officer Captain James Nicholls  as the First World War gets underway. Albert subsequently pleads with the officer and begs for him not to take the horse, but Nicholls can only promise that he will take care of Joey as his own horse and hopefully return him after the war. Albert tries to enlist in the army but is too young, and before the captain leaves with Joey, Albert ties his father's pennant to Joey's bridle. Joey is trained for military operations and becomes attached to Topthorn, a black horse with whom he is trained for his military role, and the two horses become friends. The two horses are deployed to France with a flying column under the command of Captain Nicholls, but the Cavalry charges are now hopelessly obsolete, a fact that becomes tragically clear when Captain Nicholls and his fellow cavalrymen charge through a German encampment and although achieving initial success, are met with the concentrated firepower of emplaced machine guns. Nicholls is killed along with most of his fellow cavalrymen, and the Germans capture the horses. On the German side a 14-year-old Michael  convinces a superior that the two horses are fit to pull an ambulance wagon, and he and his brother Gunther  drive the horses. Gunther gives the pennant to Michael as a good-luck ""charm"" when he is assigned to the German front, but Gunther ignores an order to remain behind and await call to a later position. Unable to persuade his brother to remain behind, he captures him from the column, on horseback, with Gunther riding Joey and Michael riding Topthorn. Their goal is to ride to Italy, but they stop for the night to hide in a farm's windmill and are discovered by their fellow German soldiers. Their status evident, they are executed by firing squad. The following morning, a young orphaned French girl named Emilie , who lives at the farm with her grandfather , finds the two horses inside the windmill and takes care of them. German soldiers arrive and confiscate all food and supplies from the property, but Emilie hides the horses in her bedroom to avoid them being taken by the Germans. Emilie suffers from a disease that makes her bones fragile and is not allowed to ride the horses for fear of falling. Nonetheless, Emilie's Grandfather, for her birthday, allows her to ride Joey, and she gallops the horse up the hill adjacent to the farm. This proves to be a dreadful mistake, and when Emilie does not return immediately, Topthorn races off towards the hill, with the Grandfather following behind. He sees that she has run into the German soldiers who ransacked their farm earlier. The German soldiers take the horses, despite Emilie's protests. The Grandfather keeps the pennant. Joey and Topthorn are put to pulling German heavy artillery, an exhausting task which kills horses quickly, either by gunfire or exhaustion. They serve in this brutal task under care of Private Friedrich , who loves horses and tries to help them survive. By 1918, Albert has enlisted and is fighting alongside Andrew in the Second Battle of the Somme, under the command of Lyons's son David . After a British charge into no-man's land, Albert, Andrew, and other British soldiers miraculously make it across into a deserted German trench, where a gas bomb explodes, filling the trench with mustard gas. Joey and Topthorn have survived years of hard service in the German army, much longer than most horses, but Topthorn finally succumbs to exhaustion and dies. Friedrich is dragged away by other German soldiers, leaving Joey to face an oncoming tank. The horse escapes and runs into the no-man's land, where he gallops through the devastated Somme and gets entangled in the barbed wire barriers. From their respective trenches, both British and German soldiers spot Joey in the night mist, and although disbelieving at first that a horse could have survived the battle, a British soldier from South Shields, named Colin , waves a white flag and crosses the no man's land, trying to free the horse and coax him to the British side. Pieter , a German soldier from Düsseldorf, comes over with wire cutters, and together they free Joey from the barbed wire. They flip a coin to decide who should take possession of the horse; Colin wins and guides Joey back to the British trench, now having formed an unexpected friendship with Pieter. Andrew has been killed by the gas attack, but Albert has survived, temporarily blinded and with bandages covering his eyes. While recuperating at a British medical camp, he hears about the ""miraculous horse"" rescued from no-man's land. The army doctor  instructs Sgt. Fry  to put Joey down, due to his injuries. But when Fry is about to shoot, Joey hears the owl call he learnt as a colt. Albert is led through the troops to Joey, again sounding his call, and Joey hurries to meet his long-missed friend. Albert explains that he raised Joey, and with bandages still covering his eyes, gives an exact description of the horse's markings, confirming his claim. Joey is covered in mud, so the veterinary surgeon at first dismisses Albert's statement, but he is astonished when soldiers wash away the grime, revealing the four white socks and diamond star on Joey's forehead. The armistice - on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918 - that brings the end of the war coincides with Albert regaining his eyesight. When he learns that only officers' horses will be shipped home, he accepts funds from his fellow soldiers to purchase Joey at a scheduled highest-bidder auction, but finds himself losing a bidding war with a French butcher, reaching 30 pounds. Then a bid of 100 pounds is entered. The bidder is an older gentleman, Emilie's grandfather, who informs the butcher that if he is bid against, he will sell his coat and bid to 110 -- and should he be bid against again, he will sell his farm and bid to 1000. No other bid is placed, and the grandfather takes ownership of Joey, planning to return with him to his farm. He tells Albert that Emilie has died, and after hearing about the miracle horse, he has walked three days to get Joey back, for the sake of his beloved granddaughter's memory. Albert pleads for the horse with Emilie's grandfather, who at first remains stoic. The old man is surprised, however, when the horse chooses to return to Albert as if to say goodbye, and he subsequently presents Albert with the military pennant, asking him what it is. Albert's quick recognition of the pennant convinces the grandfather that Joey is indeed his horse, and that returning Joey to his care is a better tribute to the memory of Emilie. Finally, Albert is seen returning with Joey to his family's farm, where he hugs his parents and returns the pennant to his father. The elder Narracott extends his hand to the boy who has become a man."

The Midway is carrying some politicians to view the test firing of a V-2 missile from its flight deck. Sighting the carrier, the Bluefin attempts a simulated torpedo attack but is detected and ""sunk"" by a depth charge attack from a destroyer. After viewing the successful launching of the V-2 from the surface, Talbot attempts to convince his commanding officer that if his submarine would have had a guided missile his attack on the carrier would have been successful. His commander relays the information that the Navy has been thinking of the same idea and sends the Bluefin to the Pacific Missile Test Center at Naval Air Station Point Mugu for a short period of training and familiarisation. On the way to the base the Bluefin ruins the fishing nets of Lars Hansen 's  fleet who fish the area when the Navy is not testing their missiles. The crew of the Bluefin are impatient with the training course they must do and attempt to speed things up and gather their own equipment through ""midnight supply""  but run foul of the tight security on the base. Talbot meets and unsuccessfully attempts to seduce the base commander's secretary Karin Hansen, a Danish emigre who is the daughter of the still furious Captain Lars. Talbot does obtain information from Karin on the location of needed missile parts at an army base and obtains them for his boat. The unorthodox procedures used so well in wartime cause tragedy to the couple; Karin losing her job as the Admiral's secretary for revealing information and Talbot's haste in launching a missile from his boat's deck causing him serious injury and the death of his friend Quartermaster ""Fuss"" Payne . Talbot's depression leads him to not desiring to walk without braces and is within a hairs breadth of being medically discharged from the Navy. Karin snaps Talbot out of his whining self pity to take command of his boat during manoeuvers for a submarine flotilla to attack a surface fleet. Talbot gets the idea for the missile carrying submarines to launch their missiles but then have them successfully guided to the surface fleet by the nearer submarines originally earmarked for a torpedo attack."

He supports his father James, an out-of-work actor with a great admiration for Shakespeare, but also with an inability to remember lines from the Bard's work. Most characters in the film describe James as a ham. Jim lives with his impeccable valet, Bayliss. Jim is happy when he finds out that his father is to be engaged to Eugenia Willis, until it turns out that Eugenia's overbearing sister, Nesta Pett, refuses to give permission for the marriage due to doubts of James' sincerity and his financial background. One morning, James' tries to introduce the Petts to his son, whom he describes as an artist, but Jim, who has stayed out all night drinking again, comes staggering in to find that Nesta Pett has discovered that the ""artist"" is a caricaturist, which does not impress her. Meanwhile, Jim meets and falls in love with Ann Chester, Nesta Pett's niece, whom he meets in a nightclub. Ann is dating Lord Frederick 'Freddie' Priory, and therefore keeps her distance from Jim, despite his several failed attempts to get to know her better and to woo her. To worsen the matters, Jim finds out he is fired because he missed numerous deadlines, and the Petts take Eugenia and Ann with them to the French Riviera for a month, leaving James sad and Jim, who is clueless about Ann's family connection, wondering where she has disappeared to. But Jim has developed a comic strip based on the Petts , and it's a huge hit in England. The strip is titled 'From Rags to Riches', featuring the 'Richswitch Family'. The cartoons become an instant success, and Jim grows financially secure. He uses his new wealth to hire a team of detectives to find Ann. When the Petts return to England, they are recognized as the people from the drawings, and are soon the joke of the town. This infuriates the family, including Ann. Jim, upon learning Ann is the niece of the Petts, hides his identity and instead poses as Bayliss' son. He finagles a way to spend a few hours with Ann before her family flees England for the United States, and he works out a way to cross to New York on the same ship as Ann and Lord Priory. Before leaving England, he tries to cancel the comic strip, but learns he doesn't own the rights to it. He also learns that the strip has been picked up by newspapers in the States.

Bayliss suspects that Ann's fiancée Freddie is not a descendent of the wealthy Priory family as he insists, so Jim tries to discredit Freddie. At a party, he announces that he will ""unmask the imposter."" James – as count Osric – feels this is addressed to him, so he reveals his true identity, and is immediately rejected by the Petts.

On the boat, Bayliss encourages him not to give up.

Mrs. Kinsolving  is cold to Francesca, questions whether she is actually pregnant with her son's baby, and tells Francesca she wants nothing to do with her or her baby in the future. It soon becomes clear that Francesca cannot leave that night as a blizzard has made the roads impassable. Francesca is forced to stay in the Kinsolving mansion for a few days. She soon begins to suspect that something is amiss due to inconsistencies in information between what her late husband  told her and Mrs. Kinsolving's statements to her. While Matthew never mentioned he had a sister, Mrs. Kinsolving claims that the mentally challenged and non-verbal Kathleen  is Matthew's sister. After Mrs. Kinsolving retires for the night, Francesca sneaks around and discovers in the family bible that Matthew's mother  died eleven days after Matthew was killed in the Vietnam War, that Mrs. Kinsolving is actually Maria's sister, Katherine, who is Kathleen's mother and the mother of Kenny , a serial rapist and murderer who is hiding somewhere in the Kinsolving mansion. Francesca goes into labor, but Mrs. Kinsolving refuses to call for an ambulance. She sedates Francesca heavily. When the baby is born, Mrs. Kinsolving announces it is dead and hands the baby over to Kathleen to bury. That night, Kathleen rouses Francesca and takes her to the attic where she finds Kathleen has hidden her baby in a picnic basket. The baby is very much alive. Mrs. Kinsolving, suspecting Francesca is sneaking around the mansion, locks her in her room. Kathleen is able to locate the key to the room and unlocks it, allowing Fracesca to care for her baby. One night, Francesca secretly spies the unsuspecting Kenny who is hiding in the basement laundry. She overhears his conversation with Mrs. Kinsolving, and it is menacing. Meanwhile, Mrs. Kinsolving discovers that the family bible has been opened to the page detailing the date of Maria Kinsolving's death. Mrs. Kinsolving informs Kenny that Francesca knows Maria is dead, but does not think she is aware that Kenny is hiding in the mansion. The next morning, Mrs. Kinsolving announces that the blizzard has cleared enough for a driver to take Francesca into town to take the bus back to Los Angeles. At breakfast, the driver arrives—and it is Kenny. Francesca quickly tells Mrs. Kinsolving that she left her gloves in her third floor room and she needs to retrieve them. Instead she gets her baby from the attic, hides the baby under her coat and flees the mansion. However, Mrs. Kinsolving spots Francesca running away and yells for Kenny to get her. He takes chase and Kathleen notices. Francesca sees Kenny is quickly gaining ground, and she darts into the carriage house in an attempt to elude him. He locates her, they struggle, and he knocks Francesca unconscious. The baby slips from under her coat. Kenny smiles sadistically and covers the crying baby's face with his hand. Suddenly, Kathleen sneaks up behind him and stabs him in the back with a pair of scissors. The film ends with Mrs. Kinsolving cradling her dead son as Kathleen and Fracesca, holding her baby, look on and help arrives.

After Mrs. Kinsolving retires for the night, Francesca sneaks around and discovers in the family bible that Matthew's mother  died eleven days after Matthew was killed in the Vietnam War, that Mrs. Kinsolving is actually Maria's sister, Katherine, who is Kathleen's mother and the mother of Kenny , a serial rapist and murderer who is hiding somewhere in the Kinsolving mansion. Francesca goes into labor, but Mrs. Kinsolving refuses to call for an ambulance. She sedates Francesca heavily. When the baby is born, Mrs. Kinsolving announces it is dead and hands the baby over to Kathleen to bury. That night, Kathleen rouses Francesca and takes her to the attic where she finds Kathleen has hidden her baby in a picnic basket. The baby is very much alive. Mrs. Kinsolving, suspecting Francesca is sneaking around the mansion, locks her in her room. Kathleen is able to locate the key to the room and unlocks it, allowing Fracesca to care for her baby. One night, Francesca secretly spies the unsuspecting Kenny who is hiding in the basement laundry. She overhears his conversation with Mrs. Kinsolving, and it is menacing. Meanwhile, Mrs. Kinsolving discovers that the family bible has been opened to the page detailing the date of Maria Kinsolving's death. Mrs. Kinsolving informs Kenny that Francesca knows Maria is dead, but does not think she is aware that Kenny is hiding in the mansion. The next morning, Mrs. Kinsolving announces that the blizzard has cleared enough for a driver to take Francesca into town to take the bus back to Los Angeles. At breakfast, the driver arrives—and it is Kenny. Francesca quickly tells Mrs. Kinsolving that she left her gloves in her third floor room and she needs to retrieve them. Instead she gets her baby from the attic, hides the baby under her coat and flees the mansion. However, Mrs. Kinsolving spots Francesca running away and yells for Kenny to get her. He takes chase and Kathleen notices. Francesca sees Kenny is quickly gaining ground, and she darts into the carriage house in an attempt to elude him. He locates her, they struggle, and he knocks Francesca unconscious. The baby slips from under her coat. Kenny smiles sadistically and covers the crying baby's face with his hand. Suddenly, Kathleen sneaks up behind him and stabs him in the back with a pair of scissors. The film ends with Mrs. Kinsolving cradling her dead son as Kathleen and Fracesca, holding her baby, look on and help arrives.

The film then opens with a police car chase through Orange County, California, which ends with the fleeing vehicle crashing, killing both of its occupants. It turns out that both were drug addicts and under the influence at the time of the chase. At a hearing, one of the boys' aunt, an attractive young mother and housewife named Phyllis Carter , angrily denounces police efforts to control the flow of illegal narcotics. Later, she comes to the police offering to volunteer her services as an undercover narcotics agent. The police originally reject her offer, but after discovering that their primary source of information on a particular gang of drug smugglers has been murdered, they reconsider. Ralph Carter , Phyllis' husband, initially laughs off the idea, but when he finds out that the police actually want make use of Phyllis, he becomes worried. He consents on the condition that should he ever ask her to quit, she and the police will comply. Phyllis Carter is provided with a new identity: Lynn Stuart, an ex-convict from West Virginia who had served 18 months in prison for her part in a bank robbery. She is also given a job as a waitress in a local diner, where members of the targeted gang are known by police to congregate. The police direct her to Willie Down , whom they suspect might be able to lead them to the head of the outfit. Eventually, Carter, acting the role of Lynn Stuart, indeed does catch Down's attention and she becomes his girlfriend. As she becomes closer to Down, Carter learns many of the ins-and-outs of the drug smuggling operation in which Down is involved. She reports her information back to police and says that she believes she is getting closer to being able to identify the top men in the operation. However, her home life suffers and her husband insists that she quit, which she agrees to do after the next day. But during that next day, Down pulls her deeply into a plan to hijack a competing gang's drug shipment. In the meantime, Carter's son is hospitalized with pneumonia, and the authorities are unable to contact her to inform her. After robbing the drug shipment from its drivers, Down murders them and the informant he had used from the competing gang. Carter is extremely unnerved by the killings, but can find no way to extricate herself from Down. When they stop at a gas station, she leaves a note in the restroom instructing whomever finds it to contact the police for her and direct them to the motel being used by the gang. Back at the motel, Carter's nervous and frightened behavior continues, which concerns both Down and the gang's leader Doc ([[John Anderson . When she hears a radio report that authorities are searching for Phyllis Carter, whose son is very ill, she flies into near-hysterics. Although they still do not know the truth about her, Doc and Down decide that her behavior is too much of a risk to them and that Down will kill her. Before he can do so, though, police raid the motel, having been contacted by a gas station attendant who found Carter's note. They take all of the criminals into custody and inform Carter that her son is going to be alright. After giving testimony to a grand jury, Carter is reunited with her husband and son. The family is relocated to Denver, with the Doc and his gang never knowing her true identity."

Like its source material, each character deals with a different personal conflict, such as love, abandonment, rape, infidelity, and abortion. The characters are represented by a color: Jo/Red , Juanita/Green , Yasmine/Yellow , Tangie/Orange , Alice/White , Gilda/Gray , Crystal/Brown , Nyla/Purple , and Kelly/Blue . Each of their stories are different, but the characters interact within each other's lives. The show opens with Tangie throwing her latest lover out of her house. Right after that, as Juanita arrives to piss Frank off with a houseplant, Kelly, who works for child welfare, attempts to visit Crystal on behalf of the children, but she does not get very far. As she flees her drug-addicted husband, Beau Willie, she gets some good advice from Gilda. Meanwhile, Alice shows up to beseech Tangie for money, but gets rebuffed instead. Alice goes out to raise money, and encounters Yasmine, who gives her a little money. Yasmine, a dance teacher, is boasting of how dancing gives her underprivileged girls opportunities, a way out of the ghetto, and in to college. Nyla tells her friends in the class about her graduation night with a pack of cousins, then has to throw up. Kelly's husband comes over and arrests two men, one of whom is Jo's husband. Juanita is waiting in Jo's office, with Jo's terrified assistant, Katina, running scared and making tea, and Crystal running late for work. Jo rejects the work of her photographers, demanding work of the highest caliber. Juanita is let into the office, and attempts to interest Jo in her work at starting a medical center. But Jo refuses, asserting that everyone rises and falls by their own merits. Juanita tries to warn her about the suffering in the community she cannot even see. She asks Jo what the price she has to pay to be so powerful, yet self-centered, then forcefully storms out. Kelly and her husband visit a physician, who reveals she had an untreated STD that has stripped her of the ability to have children. So Kelly runs off. Juanita gives condom advice to a group of women, only to be bothered by Frank. She brushes him off and returns to giving the women sensible talk about how to avoid unwanted consequences from sex. Tangie, who works as a bartender, finds a man and decides to show him a night of pleasure. That night, Crystal implores Beau to stop drinking, while he cares only for her accepting his marriage proposal, in the hopes of increasing his welfare benefits. Jo, meanwhile, implores her husband to call her, revealing to us that they'd had a fight that night. At the same restaurant, we also see Yasmine and Bill having a magical night. Alice comes home, grumbling that Nyla moved her box. But Alice shows Nyla the money she has been collecting and asking for, and gives it to her, believing that it is for Nyla's entrance into college. It is not enough, and asking Tangie is discussed, but Alice instead tells Nyla that her god will provide. Yasmine continues her date, explaining that she loved dance more than anything, until she met Bill. Meanwhile, Tangie is having a great time, until she discoveres the man thinks she is a prostitute. She throws him out only to be met by Nyla in the hall. Nyla requests money, which angers Tangie. Tangie correctly diagnoses Nyla as pregnant, which Nyla denies. Tangie relishes her cruelty, enjoying the idea Alice will hate Nyla the way she hates Tangie. So she tells her about an abortionist, and how to find her. Jo is in her house when her husband returns. He claims his battery died, but that does not stop her. We learn that he took money from her bank account for an investment that failed; the source of the fight she mentioned earlier. He feels emasculated, stripped of his automatic right of command of the house, in favor of him submitting to her will. Kelly's husband comes home and sees Kelly, so Kelly decides to pour her heart out to her husband in a refreshing breath of honesty. Long before she was married, she and a friend were dating the same man, unbeknownst to her. He also gave her a disease which caused her infertility. Despite this, her husband loves her, and stands by her side. Frank attempts to bother Juanita again, seducing her heavily resistant will into taking him back. The next day, Crystal makes an appointment for Jo, then delivers flowers and phone call from Jo's husband. He allows himself to go to the opera, which she loves and he hates, as a means of an apology. However, he is clearly looking at men, desiringly. Yasmine is elated by flowers when Tangie comes to pay Nyla's three-hundred dollar bill. She warns Yasmine about her suitor's intentions, and offers to pay on Nyla's behalf, but Yasmine informs her that there is nothing she has to pay for in any way. Tangie realizes Nyla's gone to see the abortionist, Rose , which indeed she has. The abortionist is terrifying, and probably drunk. While Jo is at the opera, watching as her husband and another man give each other the eye, Yasmine lets her suitor into her house. He removes his clothes, then hers, and savagely rapes her. The next morning, Jo angrily demands Crystal find a list of advertisers, which Crystal realizes, horrified, that she left in her house, and Jo takes her home. Seeing a male driver in the car, Beau Willie believes Crystal is having an affair. The abuse begins, and can be heard in Gilda's house as she watches the kids. She tries to calm their fears by telling them about their father. Going to Gilda's house, he captures the children and brutally kills them by dropping them out the window as Gilda goes to find help. Beau later gets arrested and is sent to jail for the murder of his own children. Jo and an arriving Juanita all serve as witnesses, along with Gilda, to the brutal murder of the children. Kelly's husband interviews Yasmine in the hospital about the rape, to which she gives him a blistering poem as her answer. Alice storms into the hospital to find Nyla with Kelly and some cops. Nyla was found alone and badly wounded. Kelly, walking through the hospital, discovers the grieving Crystal, along with Jo, Gilda, Juanita, and Kelly's husband. Remembering these people and learning of the children's murders, she tells her husband exactly who to go after, and where. Alice storms Tangie's house and confronts her, violently, about Nyla seeing the abortionist. She throws Tangie's newest conquest out of Tangie's house, and they argue about sexuality. They also recite poem and counter-poem against each other. We learn that Tangie's grandfather, Alice's father, had his way with her, too, causing Alice to send her to the abortionist. But Alice was watching her, supervising and protecting her, whereas Nyla was unsupervised. She reveals that her father not only took her virginity, but at fifteen, forced her to make granddaughters with a white man. Finally, Tangie screams that Alice, thinking herself so holy, let their grandfather molest her and she sees Gilda in the hall. Gilda replies ""nothing"" to Tangie when she yells ""what are you looking at"", then intrudes on her apartment, which Tangie accidentally locked herself out of. Gilda treats Tangie's shiner with some ice. She tells her that it is not just sex; she needs to find the root if she is ever going to be healed. She knows this because she once was just like Tangie. Juanita comes home to find Frank gone, but he soon comes home. Jo informs her husband, who comes home far too late, about the murder of Crystal's children. Her tears wash away some of her blindess to the suffering of others,  as she realizes how she failed to notice the clear abuse Crystal was going through. Alice and Nyla come home, and Alice forces Nyla to pray for forgiveness while anointing her head with dust and oil. She attempts to exorcise her daughter, to which Nyla slaps her and flees. She tries to seek help from Yasmine, who does not sleep, but sits in bed with a knife, causing Nyla to flee again. Crystal tries to scrub away the blood from her children on the sidewalk, with assistance from Kelly. She weeps for her children's blood, finding life no longer feels real. Kelly recognizes Crystal and they both get Nyla cleaned up. Tangie shows up with a new man of the night, so Nyla confronts her about the abortionist. The man takes an interest in Nyla as well, so Tangie accuses him of pedophila and turns him away with disgust. Tangie and Nyla argue, again. Tangie admits she has lost touch with reality, and that she is too hurt to love anyone else. Yasmine dances alone, to the poem of Sashita, a powerful goddess of creativity. The dance helps her begin to regain the power taken from her in the rape. Kelly's husband leads her to Bill's body. He was stabbed to death by a woman after he had raped her. Yasmine slaps his face, regaining more of her strength. Crystal attempts suicide by taking some sleeping pills. While Kelly, Gilda and the sisters wait, Juanita comes in, revealing she had been saved but still needed some rest. Kelly berates herself for not saving Crystal's children because she was wasting her time at a doctor's office. Juanita comes home on Frank's birthday to discover all his things gone, and some of hers, too, in a metaphoric sense which a poem helps her express. As Yasmine continues her classes, and Juanita continues hers, Crystal is fed, then taken home from the hospital, and Jo makes a donation to Juanita. Tangie invites Crystal to a party in Nyla's honor at Juanita's center. Frank tries to come back, but Juanita does not break down this time and sends him away for good. Gilda goes in, forces Crystal to face herself, and accept the fact that she did not protect her kids. She gives her a rebirthing experience. Jo confronts her husband about his infidelity with men, forbids the word 'sorry' from her life, reveals she has HIV, and tells her husband that he is to be gone before she gets back. Jo goes to the party, and everyone is there, even Crystal. Alice shows up briefly, giving Nyla some books, and telling her how proud of her she is before the music drives her out. Jo and Juanita withdraw to the roof, where Juanita gives Jo some advice about HIV. All of the girls except for Alice join them on the roof, where Juanita says ""My love is too beautiful to have thrown back in my face."" They begin to share ""Sorry"" stories, which Crystal wins. Crystal reveals that she is the most healed of them all."

As a result of his failed attempt he is now unable to breathe on his own and is immobile, confined permanently in an iron lung to survive. Some years later, Klaus is being taken care of by his wife Griselda and their young daughter Rena in a large gloomy house in the country. Griselda is unhappy in Spain and, overwhelmed by the task of looking after her husband, she secretly wishes he would just die. Then a young man with a scarred face named Angelo appears, offering his services as a nurse to help take care of Klaus. Griselda takes an instant dislike towards Angelo and does not want to hire him, but Klaus insists that he should stay. In reality, Angelo has no actual nursing skills, which Griselda soon discovers, but even then Klaus refuses to get rid of him. It is revealed that Angelo was one of Klaus's victims and that, in the past, they had a sickening, sadomasochistic relationship. Angelo's true aim is revealed to be not only to take his revenge out on Klaus, but to ultimately take his place. Angelo reads Klaus passages from the diaries he stole in which the doctor describes, in detail, how he tortured his young victims. Recreating what Klaus did to him, Angelo strips and masturbates in front of Klaus' glass cage. He then calls Griselda. She tries to run away, but he kills her, hanging her from the rails of the second floor. The next day, Angelo fires the housekeeper, taking over the house with Rena's help. Rena is not disturbed by her mother's absence, as her mother was abusive towards her. Rena feels far more comfortable under Angelo's care. Angelo continues with the doctor's experiments, bringing young boys to Klaus in his iron lung. Angelo lures a child to the house with the excuse of needing help with carrying the groceries, and ties him to a chair. In front of Klaus, Angelo kills the boy by injecting him through the heart with a needle filled with gasoline. A second boy is then brought in and Angelo kills him by cutting his throat after making him sing. Fearing that Angelo is out of control and that his life and Rena's are in danger, Klaus tells his daughter to run away to the near village with a message asking for help. Angelo discovers Rena while she is trying to escape and brings her back to the house. He dominates her, sometimes assuming a perverse ""parental"" role over her using violence. Finally Angelo removes Klaus from his iron lung to die by asphyxiation while emulating the scene of his own abuse, in Rena's presence. Once Klaus is dead, Angelo takes his identity totally, getting into the artificial lung, and makes Rena take his."

A massive dam and reservoir to supply water to Liverpool has been constructed at the head of the valley above Dolwyn, but construction has stopped due to geological difficulties; what was thought to be limestone is actually granite. Realising that a cheaper and easier scheme would involve the flooding of the village, Lord Lancashire, the scheme's promoter, dispatches an agent, Rob, to visit the village and buy the land. Rob persuades a reluctant, and debt-ridden, Lady Dolwyn to sell the land, and also offers the leaseholders large sums for their leases. They are also offered new houses in a Liverpool suburb and jobs in a cotton mill for those who want them. Rob has his own reasons for wanting the village flooded; he is a native of Dolwyn, but was stoned out of it twenty years before for thievery. He is thus hated by the villagers, whom he looks down on, and especially Gareth, the village shop owner, who helped to stone him. Whilst preparing to pack up and leave, Gareth, who has also lived in England and thus is more conversant with the language, discovers documents that prove his foster-Mother, Merri , to own her hand in perpetuity. A solicitor conforms this title. Lord Lancashire himself visits Merri, but soon realises that this simple village woman cannot be bought off or cajoled - and to top it all, she is able to cure his rheumatic shoulder with simple manipulation. He decides to leave the village alone and use the more expensive and difficult method of construction. Rob is furious and decides to sabotage the dam to flood the valley. He is unable to do so and instead decides to set fire to Merri's cottage. He is confronted by Gareth and a fight ensues. Rob is knocked down by Gareth and he falls into the fire he planned to use for his devilish work. He dies of a heart attack. Merri has witnessed the events and is horrified. Determined that the killing shall not be discovered, she herself makes her way to the dam's valve room and opens the valves. The villagers watch sadly from nearby safe ground as their beloved village is slowly drowned. A short prelude to the film shows a plaque near the dam marking the deaths of two people in the flood, but that only one of the bodies was recovered. The plaque not identify the two casualties of the flood, and the mystery of their identities is used in the film to add suspense, and, more importantly, in leading to the film's theme of moral ambiguity. The riddle is implicitly answered at the film's close; of the two bodies, one belongs to the villain of the story. Clearly, this is the body that was never found, for the village was flooded in order to conceal the manslaughter forever. The one found is the body of a shepherd whose voice has been, throughout the film, the voice of the beauty of the now-flooded valley, an innocent we last see alone in the village, sitting, singing on a wall while the rising flood waters lap at his booted feet. The film may be based on the construction of the Elan Valley Reservoirs, designed to supply water to Birmingham. Some filming was carried out at these dams.

27810619	/m/0gh6206	Too Big to Fail	2011			{}	{}	"{""/m/07s9rl0"": ""Drama"", ""/m/03mqtr"": ""Political drama""}"	"Too Big to Fail chronicles the 2008 financial meltdown, focusing on the actions of Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson  to contain the problems during the period of August 2008 to October 3, 2008. Dick Fuld , CEO of Lehman Brothers, is seeking external investment, but investors are wary as Lehman is seriously exposed to toxic housing assets and the Treasury is ideologically opposed to offering any sort of bailout as they did for Bear Stearns. Paulson attempts to arrange a private solution to the Lehman problem, and both Bank of America and Barclays express interest in Lehman's ""good"" assets. Bank of America pulls back from the deal and instead chooses to purchase Merrill Lynch. Barclays is prepared to accept the terms of the merger, but British banking regulators refuse to approve the deal. Paulson directs Fuld to declare bankruptcy before the market opens. The initial reaction on Wall Street is favorable as is the political reaction. However, Paulson quickly learns that Lehman's counterparty risk is impacting the entire financial market and the stock market is in freefall. Another crisis arises as AIG begins to collapse. Paulson's team realizes that if AIG is allowed to fail, its entire insurance portfolio will default and the entire financial industry will suffer massive losses. The Treasury takes over AIG. Ben Bernanke , Chairman of the Federal Reserve, argues that the status quo is unsustainable and that the Congress must pass legislation to authorize any continued intervention by the Fed or the Treasury. Paulson's plan is to buy the ""toxic"" assets from the banks. Direct capital injection is considered and rejected. Timothy Geithner , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, realizes that the market cannot wait for Congressional action and attempts to arrange mergers between consumer banks and investment banks, but this proves untenable. Paulson receives a call from Jeffrey Immelt  of General Electric who tells him that GE is unable to finance its daily operations. Paulson realizes the crisis has spread to Main Street. Bernanke and Paulson lobby Congress, with Bernanke emphasizing that a lack of credit helped make the 1929 stock crash into the Great Depression, and that if Congress fails to act that the fallout will be far worse. The legislation looks likely to pass, but is thrown into chaos when John McCain suspends his campaign for president to join the negotiations. Paulson begs Nancy Pelosi not to back away from the negotiations, but too many Republicans vote ""no"", causing an immediate drop in the Dow of 600 points. After a wave of panic and personal haranguing from President George W. Bush, the legislation passes on a second attempt, and the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 is signed into law. Paulson decides that the only way to get credit flowing again is direct capital injections. With the help of FDIC chair Sheila Bair and the threat of an FDIC audit, Paulson informs the participating banks that they will be receiving mandatory capital injections and they must use this money to get credit moving again. The banks agree, but Paulson balks at putting additional restrictions on how the funds are to be used. Paulson's Treasury deputy for public affairs  laments that the parties who caused the crisis are being allowed to dictate the terms. Bernanke states that he hopes the banks will use the funds as intended. An epilogue reveals that although markets did stabilize and the banks repaid their Troubled Asset Relief Program funds, credit standards continued to tighten resulting in rising unemployment and foreclosures. As bank mergers continued in the wake of the crisis, these banks became even larger and at the time of the film, 10 financial institutions held 77% of all US banking assets and have been declared too big to fail."

As her illness worsens, so does Nigel's relationship with his father Alan . After Nigel's mother dies, his father begins to spend his evenings with newly divorced cleaner Mrs. Potter , whose signature lemon meringue pie is a hit with Mr. Slater; Nigel would later try to extract the recipe from her. Alan and Mrs. Potter embark on a relationship, and soon move to a remote part of the Herefordshire countryside with Nigel, who dislikes his father's new partner. As a teenager, Nigel  finds solace in home economics classes at school, and uses his improved culinary skills to gain his father's affections, thus becoming Mrs Potter's rival. The excessive food causes Mr. Slater to gain weight and become more temperamental. Nigel soon lands a job in the kitchen of his local pub to avoid Mrs. Potter, and falls in love with the landlady's son; the relationship is cut short when the latter leaves town. When Mr. Slater dies from an implied heart attack from the food that Mrs. Potter has been feeding him, Nigel's mind is set as he packs a bag for London, leaving Mrs. Potter behind. While leaving the country home, Nigel thanks Mrs. Potter and to her confusion, walks off, vowing to never see or speak to her again.

When they meet, John accuses his father of abandoning him, but his father says that ""he left it up to John."" John and Brian quickly leave the meeting. The movie then jumps to 1967, after Brian Epstein has died. The Beatles are giving a press conference about their new film, Magical Mystery Tour. John is skeptical about the film, but Paul ([[Andrew Scott  convinces him to go through with the idea. John then invites his father to his mansion to live with him. Freddie Lennon arrives and meets his grandson, Julian. Sitting with his wife, John reads the criticism of Magical Mystery Tour, while comparing his wife to Brigitte Bardot, whom he says he will meet after he returns from India. John finds a letter addressed to him, with the word ""Breathe"" written on it. Later, after finding his father in a neighbor's house, Freddie reveals that he has a 19 year old girlfriend named Pauline, with whom he wants to live. Lennon accuses his father of leaving him again, and then leaves, after telling his father that he won't live with him anymore. After meeting Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the Beatles quickly return to London, and in a press conference they say they made a mistake when they trusted Maharishi. The journalists are curious about the Beatles new business -- Apple Records. At night, before meeting Derek Taylor, John glimpses Yoko Ono from a window. John reveals to Derek that she sends him letters --one of them, the ""Breathe"" one. Derek and John go to meet Brigitte Bardot, and in the car John tells Derek he sometimes thinks he is Jesus Christ. Derek tells him that being John Lennon is enough to ""walk on water"". John is nervous about his meeting with Brigitte, and takes a tablet of LSD along with Derek.

When they meet, John accuses his father of abandoning him, but his father says that ""he left it up to John."" John and Brian quickly leave the meeting. The movie then jumps to 1967, after Brian Epstein has died. The Beatles are giving a press conference about their new film, Magical Mystery Tour. John is skeptical about the film, but Paul ([[Andrew Scott  convinces him to go through with the idea. John then invites his father to his mansion to live with him. Freddie Lennon arrives and meets his grandson, Julian. Sitting with his wife, John reads the criticism of Magical Mystery Tour, while comparing his wife to Brigitte Bardot, whom he says he will meet after he returns from India. John finds a letter addressed to him, with the word ""Breathe"" written on it. Later, after finding his father in a neighbor's house, Freddie reveals that he has a 19 year old girlfriend named Pauline, with whom he wants to live. Lennon accuses his father of leaving him again, and then leaves, after telling his father that he won't live with him anymore. After meeting Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the Beatles quickly return to London, and in a press conference they say they made a mistake when they trusted Maharishi. The journalists are curious about the Beatles new business -- Apple Records. At night, before meeting Derek Taylor, John glimpses Yoko Ono from a window. John reveals to Derek that she sends him letters --one of them, the ""Breathe"" one. Derek and John go to meet Brigitte Bardot, and in the car John tells Derek he sometimes thinks he is Jesus Christ.

An angry Panicker  finds this out, admonishes her and pockets the golden necklace. He reasons that it was ""brotherly love"" which made Bhaskaran gift the necklace to his daughter. Bhaskaran becomes impatient and finally he decides to march to the neighbouring Panicker's home and ask Snehalatha to marry him. In this daring mission he is accompanied by his friends and well wishers namely the Velichappad, Paappi the trader, Aboobacker the tea-shop owner. Madhavan Nair, an elderly respectable citizen of the village also joins in. A heated argument ensues at Panicker's household, Snehalatha finally denying any love affair with Bhaskaran and Panicker refusing to return the golden necklace. Panicker argues that such a golden necklace does not exist. Bhaskaran soon becomes the joke of the village, with people saying that he was a fool to gift the necklace , without any guarantee or surety. Life goes on in the village. A dancing school is started by a lady on the second floor of Aboobacker's dilapidated tea-shop building, Paappi continues to buy and sell cows and calves, and Madhavan Nair makes his routine night visits to the village prostitute. The Velichappad is busy organising the local temple festival. Supported by his friends Bhaskaran starts a small jewellery shop in the village.

A few days before the marriage, Panicker walks up to the tea-shop where the regular patrons are in attendance. There he shows a golden necklace saying that he purchased it from a nearby town and that was gift from him to his daughter. The village crowd appreciates Panicker's fatherly love. Bhaskaran finds out that this necklace was none other than the one he had gifted to Snehalatha a few months back. Time flies, Pavithran marries Snehalatha and he goes back to the Middle eastern country. Snehalatha is pregnant and she comes back to her home for delivery. Soon the baby is born, and Pavithran also comes back. To the shock of the Panicker family, Pavithran says he is not planning to go back and plans to buy a truck and settle down in Kerala.

And when his regular friends have gathered in the village square, Bhaskaran declares that the necklace is made of brass, containing very little gold.

By that time, Karma's followers, Kurusu and Shion set up base in a gothic club called Crime to satisfy their mistress's appetite by bringing her various girls and lure them into her realm with false promises of making their dreams a reality. As Kouga arrives, ignoring the memories he has of it, a Makai Priestess named Rekka also arrives in the city and aids a pair of Makai Priests named Akaza and Shiguto in saving a baby from a Horror posing as a mother. However, Kouga arrives and reveals the ""baby"" to be a Horror that Zaruba identifies as the cannibalistic Apostle Horror Babel. Though Rekka meddles in the fight, Kouga managed to kept her aside before donning his armor and slaying Babel. As he leaves, Kouga is approached by Akaza as he introduces him and his associates to him and Zaruba. When Kouga reveals his mission to find and destroy Karma, Rekka reveals having a personal vendetta against Horror and refuses to allow anyone to rob her of her chance to kill the fiend. However, Kouga and Zaruba are unable to find Karma despite the evil presence they are feeling around the city. The following day, Kouga find Rekka playing her flute, a Madou Brush, and learns how Rekka became a Makai Priestess so she can hunt Horrors. But Kouga reminded her that Horror-hunting are the duties of Makai Knights, not hers as a Makai Priestess; Rekka argued that's only a rule for their convenience as they are no female Makai Knights. But Zaruba argued the Makai Knights were created because the Makai Priests alone are incapable of handling the Horrors. As Rekka walks off after sealing Zaruba's mouth after finding him irritating, her intentions remind Kouga of his time training under a Makai Knight named Kengi. Deciding to find leads on Karma, Kouga arrives to Akaza's shop for aid. However, the Makai Priests have no clue on Karma's location yet mention Karma being impossible to kill by conventional means and the only way to effectively defeat her is to enter the demon mirror, which can only be done unassisted through suicide. The only way to safely enter Karma's realm and return alive is through the use of a Demon Sword of Rubis, which Akaza happens to have one. Leaving the blade to Akaza until he finds Karma's lair, Kouga watches Rekka practice before being forced to defeat her to prove that she lacks the ability to back her intentions. Later at night, Kouga traveled around the city before Zaruba senses Shion as she was about to deliver Karma another victim. Realizing, Shion is forced to discard the woman to escape the Makai Knight. Tracking her down to Crime when Karma devoured another woman, Kouga and Zaruba find a barrier erected around the club. As soon as Kouga found the barrier talisman and destroyed it, Rekka appears and confirms that someone betrayed them as the barrier is the work of a Makai Priest. Once inside, as Kouga looks around, he finds Shion luring Rekka to Karma using the image of Rekka's Makai Knight father. But before Rekka could fall for the Horror's trick, Kouga shatters the mirror. However, Karma enters a round mirror as Shion spirits it away with Rekka in pursuit. Kouga is forced to fight Kurusu, who enables Karma to forcefully control some of the patrons into fighting Kouga and Rekka. As Rekka knocks the possessed humans unconscious without hesitation in her pursuit to his dismay, Kouga cracks the mirror to break Karma's hold on the humans. With no one left to hold their enemies off, Kurusu assumes his true Horror form to overpower Kouga and Rekka. When Kouga attempts to don his armor, Shion pointed the mirror at him as Karma sucks the Garo armor into her dimension. Without his armor, Kouga is severely injured in his attempt to keep Rekka from being devoured by Kurusu. However, Akaza and Shiguto arrived with an army of shikigami ninja to drive the Horrors off. After the battle, Rekka forces Akaza to admit he betrayed them as Kouga tries to stop her from killing him. Kouga is brought to the shop to have his wounds treated, having a dream of the last time he saw Kengi, Rekka's father. Coming to, Kouga explains to a guilt-ridden Rekka of what he learned from Kengi and how by keeping her alive, many others will be saved by her hands some day. Soon after, after unintentional encouragement by Zaruba, Kouga finds Akaza and learns that Karma exploited the man's desire to see his dead wife and daughter and was given a mirror that allowed him to see his loved ones once again, in return for allowing her to feed incognito. Although he knew that was only an illusion, he could not bring himself to toss away the mirror and intends to accept the consequences of his actions. Taking the Demon Sword of Rubis from Akaza to prevent him from going on a suicide mission, Kouga intends to regain his armor. With one of her young Makai Dragons returning with the location of Karma, Rekka, Kouga, and Shiguto arrive to the building that the Horrors are hiding in without knowledge that they are walking into a trap. The three are joined by Akaza, who wishes to redeem himself. After the Makai Priests seal the building so the Horrors' evil aura would not spill outside, Kouga and the others search for Karma while dealing with numerous phantoms created from her many victims. As Kouga fights for his life against Kurusu, Rekka kills Shion before finding Karma's mirror and alerting the others to her location. Finding Shion dead again and remembering his old life as a human before he sold his soul to Karma and became a Horror, a rage-filled Kurusu arrives to stop Rekka as Kouga arrives. But Rekka succeeds in using the Demon Sword of Rubis to open a gateway, with all three entering the gateway for a final battle while Shiguto sets up a barrier outside the room to ensure no interference from the phantoms. Once inside, as Kurusu reveals his original form before assuming his Horror form, Kouga dons the Garo armor and destroys Kurusu with ease. Forced to deal with Garo personally, Karma changes the battle field as she assumes an enlarged harpy-like fighting form as she attempts to offer Garo immortality for his undying loyalty. The odds of the battle was stacked heavily against Garo until an astral projection of Akaza delivers Rekka's flute which she had dropped earlier before entering the mirror realm, telling her to play it to summon the spirits of the fallen Makai warriors that Karma devoured. Briefly reunited with Kengi, Rekka watches as her father and other spirits give Garo the power to destroy Karma. Returning to their world, Kouga and Rekka learned that Akaza sacrificed his life for his spirit to enter Karma's realm just so to deliver the flute. Soon after, staying behind to look after the city and Shiguto, Rekka gives Kouga a young Makai Dragon if either needs to contact the other for help. On their way back to their territory, thinking up a name for the young Makai Dragon, Zaruba decides to call it ""Kaoru"", much to Kouga's annoyance."

One of the fired employees is Peter and Seth's boss, Eric Dale , who heads risk management on the floor. In his exit interview, Dale attempts to tell his now former employer that the firm should look into what he has been working on. The contracted human resources staff have no interest other than his quickly leaving the building. While Dale is being escorted out, he gives Peter a USB memory stick with a project he had been working on, telling him to ""be careful"" just as he boards the elevator. That night, Sullivan finishes Dale's project and discovers that built-in volatility in the firm's portfolio of mortgage backed securities will soon exceed the historical volatility levels of the firm. Because of excessive leverage, if the firm's assets in mortgage-backed securities decrease by 25%, the firm will suffer a loss greater than its market capitalization. He also discovers, that given the normal length of time that the firm holds such securities, this loss must occur. So Sullivan alerts Emerson, who calls floor head Sam Rogers . The employees remain at the firm for a smoking session and a series of meetings with progressively more senior executives, including division head Jared Cohen , chief risk management officer Sarah Robertson , and finally CEO John Tuld . Jared's plan is for the firm to quickly sell all of the toxic assets before the market can react to the news of their worthlessness, thereby limiting the firm's exposure, a course favored by Tuld over Rogers's strong objection. Rogers warns Cohen and Tuld that dumping the firm's toxic assets will spread the risk throughout the financial sector and will destroy the firm's relationships with its counterparties. Rogers also warns Cohen that their customers will quickly learn of the firm's plans, once they realize that the firm is only selling  the toxic mortgage-backed securities but will accept none whatever in exchange for their sale. That is they will not barter or swap, one mortgage-backed security for another. The characters finally locate Dale, who had been missing after his company phone was turned off and is eventually persuaded to come in with the promise of a generous fee and the threat of having his severance package challenged if he didn't. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Robertson, Cohen, and Tuld were aware of the risks in the weeks leading up to the crisis. Tuld plans to offer Robertson's resignation to the board and employees as a sacrificial lamb. Before the markets open, Rogers tells his traders they will receive seven figure bonuses if they achieve a 93% reduction in certain MBS asset classes in a ""fire sale"". He admits that the traders are effectively ending their careers by destroying their relationships with their clients. Meanwhile, Robertson and Dale sit in an office, being paid handsomely to do nothing for the day; Robertson vigorously defends herself that she warned of the risks although perhaps not loudly enough. Emerson manages to close the positions, but his counterparties become increasingly agitated and suspicious as the day wears on. After trading hours end, Rogers watches the same human resources team begin another round of layoffs on his floor. He confronts Tuld and asks to resign, but Tuld dismisses his protests claiming that the current crisis is really no different from various crashes and bear markets of the past, and sharp gains and losses are simply part of the economic cycle. He persuades Rogers to stay at the firm for another two years, promising that there will be a lot of money to be made from the coming crisis. Rogers sees Sullivan meeting with Cohen about his imminent promotion. Emerson survives, and it is implied that Bregman will be let go. In the final scene, Rogers is shown burying his dog that has died of cancer in his ex-wife's front lawn."

Despite the charming facade, it is immediately clear that the family is dysfunctional and emotionally distant: Avery disrespects her parents and, despite being forbidden to do so, sneaks out of the house to go to a party with her friend Kendra. Sarah appears bored with life as a housewife and yearns for more in her marriage while Kyle seems to harbor a hidden aversion towards his wife. Just as Kyle is about to leave for a business transaction, the house is suddenly invaded by a gang of robbers masquerading as police. The thieves, consisting of leader Elias , his stripper girlfriend Petal , his younger brother Jonah , and a large intimidating man named Ty , tell Kyle and Sarah that they have been spying on them for some time and are aware of the large amounts of cash and diamonds hidden in their home. They demand Kyle to open a safe hidden in the wall but, despite a threat to utilize a syringe containing lethal injection chemicals, he defiantly refuses, believing that he and Sarah would be killed if he simply gave into their demands. Sarah, meanwhile, recognizes Jonah through his mask. Through a series of Jonah's flashbacks and a conversation with Elias, it is strongly implied that Sarah and Jonah had a previous affair when the latter was employed as a technician to install the house's security system. Unbeknownst to Elias, Sarah secretly steals the syringe from him during this conversation. Having left her party in disgust , Avery returns home and, after a brief chase, is also captured and taken to her parents. Elias appeals to Kyle, claiming that he needs money to pay for a kidney transplantation for his dying mother and that, if Kyle refuses to comply, he will instead take one of Avery's kidneys. Sarah catches Elias off-guard and holds him hostage with the syringe. Forced into a Mexican standoff, the thieves compromise by letting Avery escape in exchange for Kyle opening the safe. He does so, revealing it to be completely empty. Kyle explains that he is actually bankrupt and has no money; his house and all of his possessions were bought on loaned credit. Enraged, Elias breaks Kyle's hand and instead demands material compensation by taking Sarah's prized diamond necklace. However, Kyle reveals that this too is a fake cubic zirconia replica and is completely worthless. Ty recaptures Avery from outside and brings her back into the house. Kyle volunteers for his own kidney to be taken instead of his daughter's, but Elias reveals that it was a ploy and that he hated his mother, who is already dead. Ty grows impatient after receiving a phone call and commands Elias to hurry up; Kyle realizes that the burglars are themselves being coerced into committing the heist against their will. The thieves then separate the Miller family, with Kyle and Avery being tied up and guarded in the living room and Sarah being pursued by Jonah in the kitchen. Jonah states to Sarah that he still loves her and promises that she and Avery will be left unhurt. Meanwhile, Kyle uses a lighter to burn both his own and Avery's binds; they attempt an escape and set off the house's security system. Kyle ends up in a struggle with Ty, and, despite Ty's superior strength and fighting skills, Kyle manages to inject a portion of the syringe chemicals into his arm, causing him to fall unconscious. Thinking that Ty is dead, Elias shoots Kyle in the leg and reveals his true motives: that he is a drug dealer working for an organized crime syndicate. Shortly after being given a job to sell $180,000 worth of cocaine, Elias and Petal were carjacked at gunpoint and all of their shipments were promptly stolen. Faced with threats of retribution, Elias was then forced to commit a heist  to pay off his debt. Jonah, who had previously seen the Miller's residence, suggested it as a place to rob. Avery attempts to run out of the house again but is caught by Jonah. Under the threat of her parents being killed, she is forced to answer a call from the security company and successfully convinces them{{Who}} to call off the police. However a security guard  shows up nevertheless, with Sarah ordered to make him leave, but the security guard catches sight of Jonah and recognises him as a colleague, prompting Jonah to shoot him in the head. Kyle reveals to Elias that the only thing of any worth on him is his life insurance. Desperate and out of options, Elias kicks Kyle down and prepares to kill him. At the last second, Avery remembers the money she saw at the earlier party and pleads with the thieves that she can help them steal it from the party if they spare her father's life. Elias reluctantly agrees to the proposition and sends Petal to supervise Avery as she drives to the party house and ensure that she keeps her word . Although Avery's initial idea is to seduce Jake and then steal his money, she is horrified when Petal begins to deliriously proclaim that she plans to massacre all of the party guests and then take the cash. Seeing a swerving road ahead, Avery accelerates the car, unbuckles Petal's seat belt, and intentionally crashes into a telephone pole, incapacitating Petal and allowing Avery to handcuff Petal to the steering wheel. Back at the Miller home, Sarah learns that Kyle had discovered a picture of her kissing Jonah from security footage and was suspicious for some time that she had been unfaithful. Sarah, however, insists that she is innocent and only loves Kyle: the same flashback is now shown from her perspective, revealing that Jonah is in fact mentally ill  and that the supposed love affair between him and Sarah was all in his head. The ""kiss"" had occurred to Sarah's complete surprise and against her will. At this point, Ty reawakens from his stupor and attacks Sarah. Enraged, Jonah tackles Ty and the two fight. Just as Ty is about to strangle Jonah to death, Elias shoots him in the back for trying to kill his brother. However, in his dying breath, Ty reveals to Elias that he had been set up all along: the ""robbers"" stealing his cocaine shipment were actually fellow members of the same crime organization and the operation was done in order to blackmail him into stealing more money for them. More damningly, Ty also claims that Jonah had masterminded the entire plan so he could have an excuse to return to the Miller residence and profess his love to Sarah. Elias is shocked by the allegations but refuses to believe them. Through the chaos, Sarah and a wounded Kyle escape to the tool shed behind the house and are pursued by Elias and Jonah. After a brief fight, the thieves discover a large amount of money hidden inside the shed; Kyle reveals that he had sold Sarah's real diamond necklace and was saving the money as a nest egg for his family. As Elias and Jonah begin to collect the cash, Avery appears  and points a gun at them. Elias calls her bluff and aims his gun at Sarah but he is shot and killed by Jonah for this. Jonah tries again to convince Sarah that she belongs with him but she rebuffs his offers, calling him insane. In an attempt to sacrifice himself, Kyle tells his wife and daughter to run while setting the money in the tool shed on fire. He also shoots Jonah's foot with a nail gun, trapping him in the shed. While Avery goes to call the police, Sarah tries to help Kyle but she is grabbed in a last-ditch effort by Jonah, who is convinced that it is destiny for her to die together with him in the fire. However, Kyle then shoots him in the neck, causing him to fall and become engulfed in the flames. Sarah then carries Kyle away to safety just as the shed collapses. In the backyard, Kyle tries to tell Sarah to let him die so that she and Avery can survive on his life insurance fund but she refuses, stating that she loves him regardless of whether he has money or not. Avery runs back to her parents announcing that help is finally on the way. The three family members embrace as the real police arrive and surround the house."

Traumatized by the experience, she suffered a mental breakdown, did not speak a word for two years, and was entered in a Swiss sanatorium. Upon leaving the psychiatric institution for the first time, she returns to her old home where her mother Miriam  is now in an unstable marriage with Harold Jennings , an alcoholic. Susan returns to the woods where she was raped, and is followed there by someone. She suspects that this person is Harold, but Miriam tells her that Harold left her the previous night. One night Susan sees a shadow by her window, then finds a dead man in her bathtub. She faints, regaining consciousness later in the presence of Dr. Michael Lomas . There is no trace of a body, and it seems clear to Susan that someone is trying to drive her insane. Miriam believes that Susan is hallucinating, and begins to doubt the wisdom of Susan's release from the hospital. On a different night, Susan is chased out of the mansion by someone she thinks is Harold, and outside finds a dead body in the car. She turns to John  - an old family friend and the gardener - for help, only to find the car is missing when she returns. After telling Dr. Lomas about her experiences, he concludes that her subconscious is rejecting Harold. Regardless, Susan begins to believe that Harold was the one who raped her. The same day that Harold returns to the mansion, someone from the woods calls out to Susan. She goes into the woods and finds the same dead man, who grabs her leg. She flees and hides in the cabin where she was raped. Harold arrives shortly afterward; he is later found dead, apparently shot by Susan. Miriam is told by the authorities that Susan will be returned to the sanatorium in Switzerland. It is then revealed that Miriam has been conspiring with John to subvert Susan's recovery, in order to disinherit her from her father's will.

One night Susan sees a shadow by her window, then finds a dead man in her bathtub. She faints, regaining consciousness later in the presence of Dr. Michael Lomas . There is no trace of a body, and it seems clear to Susan that someone is trying to drive her insane. Miriam believes that Susan is hallucinating, and begins to doubt the wisdom of Susan's release from the hospital. On a different night, Susan is chased out of the mansion by someone she thinks is Harold, and outside finds a dead body in the car. She turns to John  - an old family friend and the gardener - for help, only to find the car is missing when she returns. After telling Dr. Lomas about her experiences, he concludes that her subconscious is rejecting Harold. Regardless, Susan begins to believe that Harold was the one who raped her. The same day that Harold returns to the mansion, someone from the woods calls out to Susan. She goes into the woods and finds the same dead man, who grabs her leg. She flees and hides in the cabin where she was raped. Harold arrives shortly afterward; he is later found dead, apparently shot by Susan. Miriam is told by the authorities that Susan will be returned to the sanatorium in Switzerland. It is then revealed that Miriam has been conspiring with John to subvert Susan's recovery, in order to disinherit her from her father's will. Miriam admits her lifelong jealousy of Susan, because Susan's father gave her more attention than he gave Miriam. It was John who raped Susan when she was 13. A stalker targets Miriam, appearing to be Harold. She assumes that John is terrorizing her, and she fires him. The stalking continues unabated. One rainy night, Miriam catches sight of the stalker, who does appear to be Harold. John arrives shortly afterward, and Miriam shoots him dead. She tries to leave the mansion, only to find Harold in the doorway. Driven to hysteria, she screams that she ""made Susan kill"" him. In the wake of this confession, the ""stalking"" is revealed as a counter-conspiracy masterminded by Dr. Lomas. Harold is alive, his ""shooting"" a ruse to lure Miriam into a confession. Miriam coldly allows herself to be arrested."

Afterward, Fred attends his adopted younger sister Alex's  Easter school pageant with E.B. hiding in a satchel.

E.B. finds evidence of Fred's capture and races back to the factory. He confronts Carlos, but is immobilized in gummi candy and tossed into the chocolate bunny carving line.

One believes she was raped by the villagers years before, and is blind; another is afraid of sunlight, and they all react violently to crucifixes. The sisters are being manipulated by a sinister old man who alternates between admonishing them to kill newcomers that threaten their exposure and groping their breasts. The four seem to worship a bestial idol in the forest who speaks to them with a disembodied voice. The newcomers are three Parisians by the names of Thomas , Brigitte , and Marc , who have come to the countryside to cure the sisters of their so-called illness. They do not believe that the sisters are vampires, they don't believe in vampires at all. Thomas is a psychoanalist who determined to cure them from their madness which he believes has been induced by the superstitious villagers who have driven the confused women insane with their religious symbols and persecution. He tries to convince them that crucifixes do nothing to them, sunlight won't harm them, and the blind sister can actually see. He takes all of this as proof that their vampirism is all in their minds. When one of the sisters fall for Thomas' charms, the old man orders another sister to kill him, Brigitte, and Marc, and when this fails he unleashes the peasants who brutally murder all the women they can find, which also includes Brigitte. Thomas asks one of the sisters to bite him to prove her wrong and discovers she is, in fact, a vampire. It seems he has been misled by his own preconceptions. The two flee to the beach and are gunned down by Marc who is distraught by Brigitte's death, at the hands of the peasants.  The vampire queen  is introduced. She briefly arrives by boat to the beach where the dead couple lies. She commands her hooded cohort to grab the old man and pin him down to the slab of rock, she then proceeds to sacrifice him and licks the knife covered in his blood. The vampire queen tells her leading female minion to dismember the bodies of Thomas and the vampire sister so that they don't come back to life, but she fails. It is later revealed that she is in rebellion against the vampire queen. The blood from the old man revives Thomas and the vampire sister. The human doctor who runs the demented clinic is under the supervision of the vampire queen and he has been secretly searching for a cure for vampirism. The vampires abduct Brigitte's body from the cenotaph and Thomas later discovers that Brigitte is alive, she tells him that he imagined the entire trip, but he doesn't believe her. He follows her to the hospital where she is listening to an instruction tape, he stops the tape and kills her. The doctor's plot is later uncovered, while the vampire queen stages a ceremony to marry the doctor to his assistant, her minions strip the assistant and whip her on the beach. The malcontents have not bowed to her rule and the revolution explodes, which ends with the vampires being killed and the vampire queen poisoned. Thomas and the vampire wall themselves in the cellar to await death, they do not wish to feed on the living, but are too afraid that if they stay free, their thirst will drive them to murder, so they sacrifice themselves instead, ending their freedom in each others arms.Branislav L.

When a man in uniform collapses outside their cottage, they bring him into their home and lay him down on their sofa. When he dies, they realise that the man is a German parachutist and, hearing the church bells tolling to warn of invasion, Caroline takes his revolver from him. Soon afterwards, a British army officer arrives asking for a map to help him find his unit. In reality, however, this is a German spy, who is exposed when mis-pronouncing 'Jarvis Cross' as 'Yarvis Cross'. Caroline turns the dead parachutist's revolver on him and guards him, while sending Edith to seek assistance from the ARP. When Edith informs the ARP warden of the situation, he calls the Local Defence Volunteers , interrupting a lecture on German parachutists.

With the impending departure of star players Johnny Damon, Jason Giambi, and Jason Isringhausen to free agency, Beane attempts to devise a strategy for assembling a competitive team for 2002 but struggles to overcome Oakland's limited player payroll. During a visit to the Cleveland Indians, Beane meets Peter Brand , a young Yale economics graduate with radical ideas about how to assess players' value. Beane tests Brand's theory by asking whether he would have drafted him , Beane having been a Major League player before becoming general manager. Though scouts considered Beane a phenomenal player, his career in the Major Leagues was disappointing. After some prodding, Brand admits that he would not have drafted him until the ninth round and that Beane should probably have accepted a scholarship to Stanford instead. Sensing opportunity, Beane hires Brand as the Athletics' assistant general manager. The team's scouts are first dismissive of and then hostile towards Brand's non-traditional sabermetric approach to scouting players, most notably Grady Fuson  – who is fired by Beane after insulting their approach, and takes to the radio airwaves and doubts the team's future. Rather than relying on the scouts' experience and intuition, Brand selects players based almost exclusively on their on base percentage . By finding players with a high OBP but with characteristics that lead scouts to dismiss them, Brand assembles a team of undervalued players with far more potential than the A's hamstrung finances would otherwise allow. Despite vehement objections from the scouts, Beane supports Brand's theory and hires the players he selected, such as unorthodox submarine pitcher Chad Bradford . Following the free agent signings, Beane finds that he also faces opposition from Art Howe , the Athletics' manager. With tensions already high between them because of a contract dispute, Howe disregards Beane and Brand's strategy and plays the team in a traditional style despite their unsuitability. Beane eventually trades away the lone traditional first baseman, Carlos Peña, to force Howe to use the new recruits. Early in the season, the Athletics fare poorly, leading critics within and outside the team to dismiss the new method as a dismal failure. Beane convinces the owner to stay the course, and eventually the team's record begins to improve. Ultimately, the Athletics win 20 consecutive games, setting the American League record. Their streak is capped with a victory over the Kansas City Royals. Like many baseball players, Beane is superstitious and avoids attending or sometimes even following games as they are in progress. His young daughter implores him to go to the A's final game against the Royals, where Oakland is already leading 11–0 after the third inning and appears set to advance their winning streak to a record-breaking 20. Beane arrives in the fourth inning, only to watch the team go to pieces and eventually allow the Royals to even the score 11–11. Finally, the A's do win, on a walk-off home run by one of Brand's picks, Scott Hatteberg. Then, despite all their success in the second half of the season, the A's lose in the first round of the postseason, this time to the Minnesota Twins. Miguel Tejada would go on to win the 2002 American League MVP and Barry Zito the 2002 American League Cy Young Award . Beane is disappointed, but satisfied at having demonstrated the value of his and Brand's methods. Beane is later approached by the owner of the Boston Red Sox, who realizes that the sabermetric model is the future of baseball, and offers to hire Beane as the general manager of the Red Sox. In closing, the film notes that Beane passed up the opportunity to become the general manager of the Boston Red Sox, despite an offer of a $12.5 million salary, which would have made him the highest-paid general manager in sports history. He returns to Oakland to continue managing the Athletics. Meanwhile, two years after adopting the sabermetric model, the Boston Red Sox win their first World Series since 1918.

While singing, the voice boasts of his previous experience in other venues. The voice turns out to belong to a tiny grasshopper, who ends his performance with Blanc's trademark pronunciation of ""Cuc-amonga"". Porky, who is the agency's producer and listening to the auditions, tells the grasshopper he might have a spot for him. The rest of the short consists of a series of acts by various performers, most of whom Porky rejects. * A hen  clucks Blue Danube. Porky seems to like this act, but the hen literally ""lays an egg"" and takes this event in its figurative sense in that her act flopped. Porky pulls a lever next to his desk that sends the hen and the egg with a sad looking chick  in it through a trap door in the floor. * A fox, voiced by Stan Freberg, bursts in telling Porky that his act is the best ever, but Porky tells him that it's not his turn yet. * A turtle resembling Cecil Turtle but with Blanc's voice says he is the ""man of a 1000 voices."" He goes through a rapid fire montage of voice impressions . Porky says that he counted only nine hundred ninety nine voices. The turtle is stumped as to what his 1000th voice is and exits the office hoping that he'll remember it later . * Bingo the Parrot, Frankie the Rooster, and Al the Duck  sing the popular hit song April Showers, each in the distinctive manner of their namesakes. Porky tells them that he'll consider their act but says after they leave that it was a low class act that only bobbysoxers would like . * A two-headed man enters the office. Porky quotes ""Oh boy two-headed! This ought to be a sensational act!"" The two-headed man quotes ""Act, Shmact! I'm the janitor"" as he empties Porky's pail into another pail and leaves. * The fox barges into the office again, telling Porky to watch his act.

While singing, the voice boasts of his previous experience in other venues. The voice turns out to belong to a tiny grasshopper, who ends his performance with Blanc's trademark pronunciation of ""Cuc-amonga"". Porky, who is the agency's producer and listening to the auditions, tells the grasshopper he might have a spot for him. The rest of the short consists of a series of acts by various performers, most of whom Porky rejects. * A hen  clucks Blue Danube. Porky seems to like this act, but the hen literally ""lays an egg"" and takes this event in its figurative sense in that her act flopped. Porky pulls a lever next to his desk that sends the hen and the egg with a sad looking chick  in it through a trap door in the floor. * A fox, voiced by Stan Freberg, bursts in telling Porky that his act is the best ever, but Porky tells him that it's not his turn yet. * A turtle resembling Cecil Turtle but with Blanc's voice says he is the ""man of a 1000 voices."" He goes through a rapid fire montage of voice impressions . Porky says that he counted only nine hundred ninety nine voices. The turtle is stumped as to what his 1000th voice is and exits the office hoping that he'll remember it later . * Bingo the Parrot, Frankie the Rooster, and Al the Duck  sing the popular hit song April Showers, each in the distinctive manner of their namesakes. Porky tells them that he'll consider their act but says after they leave that it was a low class act that only bobbysoxers would like . * A two-headed man enters the office. Porky quotes ""Oh boy two-headed! This ought to be a sensational act!"" The two-headed man quotes ""Act, Shmact! I'm the janitor"" as he empties Porky's pail into another pail and leaves. * The fox barges into the office again, telling Porky to watch his act. Porky tells him to go back out and wait his turn. * A dog in a bathing suit named J. Fenton Hadding places his briefcase on the floor.

The only thing stolen is a necklace that Kristi's sister, Katie , had given her. Dan installs security cameras throughout the house. Martine , the family housekeeper and nanny, attempts to cleanse the house of ""evil spirits,"" and Dan fires her after catching her burning sage. Katie and Kristi talk about being tormented by a demon when they were children. Dan's daughter, Ali , begins investigating the mysterious happenings after she is lured outside by loud banging and the door shuts and locks behind her. She discovers that humans can make deals with demons for wealth or power by forfeiting the life of their first-born son. She also realizes that until Hunter, there had not been a male child born in Kristi and Katie's family since the time of their great-great grandmother. The violence escalates and Kristi is tormented further; the family's German Shepherd, Abby, is attacked and apparently suffers a seizure. Dan and Ali take Abby to the vet, leaving Kristi alone with Hunter. When Kristi checks on the baby, the demon assaults her and drags into the basement, where she stays for just over an hour. Finally, the basement door opens and a possessed Kristi walks out. The following day, Ali is home with Kristi, who will not get out of bed. Ali hears noises and eventually examines the basement door and finds it covered in scratches. She also sees a word, Meus , scratched into it. Ali goes upstairs to check on Hunter, and sees Kristi in his room, with a strange bite mark on her leg. Ali phones Dan, begging him to come home, saying ""There's something wrong with Kristi"". When he arrives, Ali, who has watched the security tapes from the night before, begs him to view the footage of Kristi's attack. After watching the tape, he immediately calls Martine, who prepares a cross to exorcise the demon; Kristi will have no memory of having been possessed. Dan tells Ali he is going to pass the demon onto Katie so that Kristi and Hunter will be saved. Ali begs him not to because it is unfair to Katie, but Dan sees no other way to save his wife and son. That night, when Dan tries to use the cross on Kristi, she attacks him and the house lights all go out. Using the handheld camera's night vision, he finds Kristi and Hunter have disappeared. Furniture begins toppling over, and the chandeliers shake. Dan chases Kristi into the basement, where she attacks him. He touches her with the cross, causing her to collapse. The ground rumbles and Dan hears demonic growls and roars, until finally the shaking stops. Dan puts Kristi to bed and burns a photo of a young Katie . Three weeks later, Katie visits and explains that strange things have begun happening at her house. Kristi tells her to not discuss it just as Katie had told her before. She returns home, where she finds Micah has purchased a new video camera; the rest of the scene consists of approximately the first two minutes of the previous film. On October 9th, a night after Micah is killed, Katie, possessed and bloodstained, breaks into Dan and Kristi's home and kills Dan by breaking his neck. She then climbs the stairs and attacks and kills Kristi in Hunter's room, hurling her against the camera with superhuman strength and taking the baby. Katie leaves the room, cradling Hunter.

His father, Frederick , is a traditionalist who believes that there are things people of their class should never do. One of those things is romancing the women of lower classes, and Frederick threatens Basil with disinheriting him if he ever succumbs to the temptation. Young Basil is, however, of a rebellious nature and, during his studies, he befriends a commoner named John Mannion . Mannion introduces the young aristocrat to Julia Sherwin , the beautiful daughter of a local merchant. Basil falls in love and marries the girl, only to realize that she was sleeping with John and was pregnant with his child. Basil attacks John in an alley and stomps his face in when he realizes what John was up to. Later he delivers Julia's child and hears John coming up the stairs. He hides and sees him with a mask covering his face. Julia tries to lift it, and John says, ""Remember as I was, not what I am now"". She dies in his arms after telling him the child is his, not Basil's. All john wants is to take the child and leave. Basil hears and chases John with a knife. They fight and Basil pulls down John's mask. He gasps when he sees his face. It is very scarred and mutilated. John has chosen not to see his face but he sees it in the reflection of the knife he is holding. He goes to a nearby cliff and commits suicide because of his ruined face.

Lucy responds to an ad and is invited to meet with Clara , who describes the job: freelance silver service in lingerie provided by her group. Lucy agrees and Clara tells her that she will never be penetrated during these encounters. She lies about using drugs and knowing how to do silver service waitressing, but Clara accepts her anyway. Clara says she will call Lucy by the name Sarah, and refers to her as such for the rest of the film. Lucy is seen getting beauty treatments and showing off her silver-service pouring skills for Birdmann before arriving for the event. She is the only girl dressed in white lingerie, which mostly covers her breasts; the other women present seem much older, have cut-out black lingerie, and wear severe makeup. The event is a formal dinner party at an ornate, elegant home for five elderly gentlemen and one woman. Lucy serves drinks throughout and is excused after having served brandy to the guests. As she is about to leave, she is intentionally tripped by one of the guests and collapses on the floor, smashing the brandy bottle, just as the party turns into more of an orgy between the guests and the other girls. She goes home with the money she made, counts out her rent, then burns one banknote. Lucy's personal life begins changing at that point. Birdmann confesses that he's not going to make it, begging off detox when Lucy suggests it. While in his apartment, Lucy asks if Birdmann will marry her, to which he casually replies yes. It becomes clear that neither is sincere about holding up their end of the proposal, and that this is more of a running joke. After at least one other session as a serving girl, Lucy gets a call from Clara's assistant Thomas  for a different request.

He compares his life to that of the character, stating that ""all of his bones are broken"" and that he will soon need Clara's help. After Clara reminds the man of the no penetration rule and departs, he strips, caresses Lucy's body, and cuddles up next to her as the scene fades. After a tense conversation with her landlords, Lucy is evicted from her room. She rents a much more expensive apartment with a beautiful view of the city, taking on the lease before even seeing the place. She also asks Thomas if he could help her getting more jobs from Clara, given her new expense. After two more sessions sleeping at Clara's house , Birdmann calls her; he has overdosed on drugs, and she visits him as he dies. She takes off her shirt and gets in bed with him, crying but making no effort to help him. At his funeral, Lucy talks to a former acquaintance and blandly asks him if he'll marry her, echoing her earlier casual banter with Birdmann.

She is the only girl dressed in white lingerie, which mostly covers her breasts; the other women present seem much older, have cut-out black lingerie, and wear severe makeup. The event is a formal dinner party at an ornate, elegant home for five elderly gentlemen and one woman. Lucy serves drinks throughout and is excused after having served brandy to the guests. As she is about to leave, she is intentionally tripped by one of the guests and collapses on the floor, smashing the brandy bottle, just as the party turns into more of an orgy between the guests and the other girls. She goes home with the money she made, counts out her rent, then burns one banknote. Lucy's personal life begins changing at that point. Birdmann confesses that he's not going to make it, begging off detox when Lucy suggests it. While in his apartment, Lucy asks if Birdmann will marry her, to which he casually replies yes. It becomes clear that neither is sincere about holding up their end of the proposal, and that this is more of a running joke. After at least one other session as a serving girl, Lucy gets a call from Clara's assistant Thomas  for a different request. Lucy is driven to a country mansion where Clara informs her that she'll drink some tea and then fall into a deep sleep. Later we see Lucy lying in a large bed, sedated, as Clara leads in the man who hosted the first dinner party. He recollects having recently re-read a short story from ""The Thirtieth Year"" by Ingeborg Bachmann, about a man who strived to escape his life but could not do so. He compares his life to that of the character, stating that ""all of his bones are broken"" and that he will soon need Clara's help. After Clara reminds the man of the no penetration rule and departs, he strips, caresses Lucy's body, and cuddles up next to her as the scene fades. After a tense conversation with her landlords, Lucy is evicted from her room. She rents a much more expensive apartment with a beautiful view of the city, taking on the lease before even seeing the place. She also asks Thomas if he could help her getting more jobs from Clara, given her new expense. After two more sessions sleeping at Clara's house , Birdmann calls her; he has overdosed on drugs, and she visits him as he dies. She takes off her shirt and gets in bed with him, crying but making no effort to help him. At his funeral, Lucy talks to a former acquaintance and blandly asks him if he'll marry her, echoing her earlier casual banter with Birdmann. Unlike Birdmann, he believes her to be sincere and is dumbfounded. He refuses, citing a previous failed relationship with her, his new relationship that is working well, and several character flaws that he observes in Lucy. He tells her to ""Fuck [herself] to death"" and to try courtesy. Lucy raises her glass ""to courtesy."" Shortly after, she is fired from her office job. Lucy then buys a small concealable camera at an electronics store, and tests it during one of her classes. She takes drugs with a coworker from her coffee shop job, goes night swimming with him, and wakes up naked in her apartment with him in the bed next to her. She is late for her assignment with Clara, who has already sent a car to retrieve her. She is hung over, and vomits on the ride to the mansion. Once Lucy arrives, she lies to Clara, saying she feels ""fine,"" and then asks Clara if she can see what happens during the sessions while she is asleep. Clara refuses, saying it will put her clients at risk of blackmail and that no exceptions are made. Right after being placed on the bed for the session, however, she awakes, and removes the small camera which she had concealed in her mouth. Staggering under the onset of the effects of the sleep-inducing tea, she is able to place the camera and return to bed before being found out. The client is once again the first man, but this time he also drinks the tea with a much larger dose of the drug. The morning after, Clara comes in and checks the man's pulse, showing no surprise when he cannot be awakened. She then tries to wake Lucy but is at first unable to do so, eventually having to use mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Lucy wakes and, discovering that the naked man lying beside her is dead, screams in desperation. The movie ends with the scene captured by the camera that Lucy had installed: the dead old man and the sleeping girl both lying on the bed."

Another man then kills him with ahammer to the face. A journalist, Carmen , is having problems with her relationship with her boyfriend, Marcus  who is a photographer. Carmen never seems to stop thinking about work and tends to ignore him. Carmen asks her boss to allow her to to investigate the disappearances of several tourists in the fictional Polish village of Alvania . The last person to go missing was Eric Taylor , the man killed at the beginning of the film. She also mentions that the luggages of all the missing tourists end up being found all around Eastern Europe. Her boss isn't interested in another missing persons case, saying that people go missing all the time and does not give her permission to go. Instead, he would rather have her investigate why a farmer's bees go missing. Carmen and her intern Sara  visit Eric's mother, Laura. Laura tells them that she has tried to get the help of both the Polish and the American Police. However, they are unwilling or too busy to help her. Carmen asks Laura if Eric's luggage has been returned to her. Laura says that it has and Carmen borrows Eric's journal. Later in her home while reading Eric's journal, she has a dream of Eric with bloody eyes who tells her ""leave me alone"". Carmen, wanting to mend her relationship with Marcus as well as her job, urges him to come with her and Sara to Alvania. Upon reaching Alvania, they find the village people to be secretive, unfriendly and unwelcoming, just as described in the last entry in Eric's journal. Although English is taught in the villages' school, not all the villagers know how  to speak it. They see a man named Henryk butchering a pig then find a girl named Lidia picking flowers and approach her. They show her a picture of Eric and ask if she has seen him. The girl reacts at the site of Eric in the picture but is hesitant to answer. Before she even can, Henryk calls to her and sends her off. Carmen, Sara and Marcus explore the village. They notice that the villagers treat their religious leaders like royalty. They then spot a strange dense area of fog which seems to be concentrated only in one portion of the forest, also mentioned in Eric's notes. They are threatened by Henryk and the villagers and told to leave the village when they attempt to move toward the fog. Leaving the village initially, Carmen tells Marcus that they should go back and investigate the fog. Marcus initially disagrees and insists that they leave. Carmen manages to convince Marcus to return by admitting her editor knows nothing about the trip and that her career will be over if she returns with no story. They leave their car and walk into the forest where they eventually find the area with the fog. Carmen, Sara and Marcus find it strange that the fog seems to never move and is quite dense, therefore preventing Marcus from taking pictures of anything inside the fog. Sara enters the fog and disappears into it. Carmen and Marcus wait for Sara to return but after awhile, they lose their patience. Marcus insists that they leave but they can't leave Sara behind. Carmen enters the fog to find Sara. Moments after she enters the fog, Sara somehow gets out and is found by Marcus. Sara appears scared and unfocused. Carmen seems to have gotten lose in the fog and comes across a statue of a demon holding a heart. Carmen takes a picture of it. As she moves to the side of the statue in order to take another picture, the statue turns its head to face Carmen. The statue's eyes bleed and the 'heart' in its hand start to beat. This frightens Carmen. As she backs away from the statue, she find herself out of the fog and is found by Marcus and Sara. Sara and Carmen talk about seeing the statue, both a bit disoriented, also having heard strange whispering voices. As they make their way back to their car, they come arcoss Lidia who claims to know the whereabouts of Eric and takes them to a hidden sacrificial shrine, where they discover the bodies of people  that the village people have executed. Each body has a metal mask deeply embedded on its face, making it look as though the villagers are cultists and are practicing some kind of ritual black magic on the tourists who come to Alvania. Marcus, Sara and Carmen notice that Lidia is gone and finds the door to the shrine barred. Luckily, Marcus is able to open it but they are suddenly surrounded by the villagers and flee, hiding in a nearby barn. They are found and struggle to escape but one of the villagers knocks out Carmen. Henryk shoots Sara's leg with a crossbow. The villagers knock her out with chloroform but not before she sees the one of the villagers' face turn into a demon. Marcus runs into the forest and is chased by Henryk. Henryk catches up with him. Marcus fights Henryk but the latter gains the upper hand and knocks him out with chloroform. As they wake up, they see Henryk talking to Lidia. Lidia walks off and the villagers bring them back to the entrance of the sacrificial shrine where the head of the village's church, Arkadiusz, decides to sacrifice both Sara and Carmen. Sara and Carmen are taken inside the shrine while Marcus is led away by two villagers and is forced to dig a grave at gunpoint. After one of them leaves, Marcus uses the shovel to disarm the remaining villager with the gun and knock him unconscious. He takes the gun and runs off to rescue Sara and Carmen. At the shrine, cultists strip Carmen and Sara and don them with ceremonial gowns. The Cultists place Sara on the same ceremonial table where Eric was killed while Carmen is placed in a prison cell. The Cultists secure her arms, legs and head. They then deeply lacerate her arms and sever her Achilles' tendons. While this is being done to her, she sees the faces of the Cultists and Arkadiusz turn into demons. The same mask they found on the corpses is placed over Sara's head. It has two spikes inside of it which are meant to pierce Sara's eyes and embed the mask on her face. Arkadiusz takes a sledgehammer and uses it to embed the mask on Sara, executing her in the process. One of the Cultists looks at Carmen and she sees that the Cultist's face become that of a demon as well. They bring her out to be sacrificed but Marcus rescues her. He locks the Cultists in the shrine and he and Carmen make their escape. They enter a villager's house to steal the keys to a truck. Marcus sees a woman, Emilia, and her son, Dariusz, in the kitchen. The woman calls for her husband, Aleks, but is unable to do anything since Marcus still has the gun. Marcus asks them for the keys to the truck but they can't understand English. When they see Carmen, Emilia expresses fear and panic. Marcus takes the family to their living room and ties up the couple. While Marcus tries to get them to give him the keys, Carmen starts to experience voices. She sees the objects in the room shake. She sees Daruisz turn into a demon. She sees Emilia and Aleks turn demonic, untie themselves and crawl on the floor. Marcus turns to Carmen and he too has becomes a demon. But in truth, all of them are still human—Emilia and Aleks are still tied up and none of them are even looking at her. Carmen hides in another room where she continues to see and hear things. Dariusz, who understands and speaks English, leads Marcus back to the kitchen and gives him the truck keys. Not wanting to risk Dariusz going out and calling for help, Marcus also ties him up. The boy begs for Marcus to let them go and warns him that Carmen is evil since she has seen the statue. Carmen is then possessed by a demon while she is alone in the room and lets out a very loud shriek. The cultists, who have gotten free and are looking for Carmen, hear the shriek and are alerted of Carmen's location. Marcus hears Carmen calling out to him. He enters the room she went inside through a door from the kitchen. As he enters the room, another door leading back to the living room closes. Marcus hears Aleks and Emilia scream in fear and pain, followed by footsteps going to the kitchen. Marcus then hears Dariusz screaming. As he looks out from the door, he sees the boy being dragged away. The door then closes and Dariusz's screaming stops. The door leading to the living room slowly opens. He goes to the living room and finds the entire family brutally killed. A possessed Carmen then jumps on him and pins him on the floor. Just as she is about to kill Marcus, she is confronted by the cultists. She kills several of them. Arkadiusz fights back with prayers and holy water. He calls for the mask but the Cultist holding the mask is stunned in fear, giving the possessed Carmen the opportunity to impale Arkadiusz. Carmen turns her attention back to Marcus. Before Arkadiusz dies, he passes on his duties to Henryk. Henryk chants prayers while splashing Carmen with holy water. Henryk stabs Carmen. The prayers weaken her, allowing Henryk to slowly set on her on the floor. Two more Cultists help. They impale Carmen's hands and pin her to the floor. Henryk calls for the mask and this time, the Cultist holding the mask complies. They position the mask over Carmen's face while Henryk readies the sledgehammer. However Carmen stills struggles and the mask can't be properly placed over her eyes. Marcus now realizes what is going on and understands why it was necessary to kill Sara and Carmen. Sara and Carmen saw the statue which is why the villagers had to kill them but not Marcus. The cultists weren't sacrificing anyone. They were trying to prevent demonic possessions from taking place. Knowing this, Marcus helps out Henryk and the others by holding Carmen's head still. With the mask now in place, Henryk readies the sledgehammer to embed the mask. Carmen returns to normal and asks Marcus for help but Marcus knows it is just a trick. Henryk sends the sledgehammer down and embeds the mask on Carmen, killing her. Marcus then looks at Henryk and the remaining men, wondering what will happen to him since he knows too much. One of the villagers asks Henryk on what they will do with Marcus. In the end, Marcus is set free by the villagers. Henryk offers to have one of the village's men take him to where he needs to go. Marcus looks over to the forest where the fog is seen. Not really knowing what is really inside the fog, he asks Henryk about it. He is told that the fog and the statue are a curse left long ago to the village that cannot be undone. The devilish statue is shown once more and the screen goes black."

In her childhood, her family and friends are evicted from their low-rent housing so that developers can turn it into expensive, seaview flats. Later in life, she vows to buy her mum and dad a new flat, but is unable to fulfill her promise before her mother dies. When her father becomes ill, she begins searching in earnest for a new place, finally fixating on the expensive building that now stands where she previously lived with her family. The flat costs millions, though, and the bank will only give her a 70% mortgage. The payments would reach over $15,000, and her two part-time jobs might not permit her to pay that. Unfortunately, because of an oversight in declaring her father's medical history, she no longer has insurance to pay for his expensive treatment. Thus, Lai-sheung must get a second job to save enough money for the flat of her dreams. Though she saves enough for a down-payment, her fathers medical bills become excessive. Lai-sheung asks her married lover to loan her some money for medical bills, but he refuses. One night, her father has trouble breathing; instead of giving him his oxygen, Lai-sheung allows her father to die. The insurance payment adds enough money to her current savings for her to purchase her dream flat. She immediately calls her real estate agent and agrees to take the flat at No 1 Victoria Bay. On her way to finalise the agreement, there is a hike in the stock market that makes the owners decide to raise the price. This sends Lai-sheung into a devastating frenzy where she attacks people who live in the high-rise, killing them with low-tech and household items. First, it is a security guard, whom she suffocates with a zip-tie. Next, she goes upstairs and kills a pregnant woman, her in-house helper, and her cheating husband. Upon hearing loud music from the upstairs flat, Lai-sheung goes up a floor and kills the five people partying in the apartment. During the course of these attacks, Lai-sheung is scratched on the face and stabbed in the ankle. She forms a tourniquet with her sock and another zip-tie. The police arrive at the flat, demanding entry. A struggle ensues, and both officers are  killed. Lai-sheung returns to her day job, and receives a call from her agent. He claims that the owners of the flat wish to sell after all. Lai-sheung suggests that they might want to sell for a much lower price, since there were 11 murders in the building the previous evening. That night, Lai-sheung's lover comes round to pick her up, but she turns her back on him and walks away, ending their relationship.

Yuan Ni expresses to her husband her desire to have one more child, and they get into the back of their truck after putting their son and daughter to bed. Suddenly the ground shakes, and buildings begin tumbling down. Running back to save their kids, Yuan Ni is pulled back by her husband, who runs ahead of her and is instantly crushed. Their house falls down, trapping her two children. In the aftermath of the 1976 Tangshan earthquake, a rescue team informs Yuan Ni that her twins Da and Deng are trapped together under a slab of concrete. Lifting the slab in any way will kill one of her children - lifting it one way will save the daughter at the expense of her son; lifting it the other will save the son at the expense of her daughter. Heartbroken, she is forced to choose between her children, and finally decides to save the son. Her decision, however, is overheard by her daughter, who tearfully whispers ""Ma..."" as the screen goes black. The mother clings to her daughter's body before being pulled away to take care of Da, ""her one child who still lives."" Later, Deng wakes up in a sea of bodies, next to the body of her deceased father. Assumed to be an orphan by the soldiers who found her in the camp, Deng is adopted by a military couple. She refuses to speak, and claims not to have remembered anything before the earthquake. She eventually opens up and bonds with her adopted parents. Ten years later, Deng is accepted into medical school and moves away, where she meets a graduate student and begins an intimate relationship with him. In her third year of study, Deng's adopted mother falls ill. Before dying, she asks Deng to use the money they saved up for her to find Deng's real family. Deng doesn't respond. After getting back from the hospital, Deng finds out she is pregnant, and despite being pressured by her boyfriend to get an abortion, she refuses to abandon her baby the way her mother abandoned her. She secretly drops out of university and loses contact with her boyfriend and her adopted father. During that period of time, Da grows up with his mother, who is still torn from the decision she had to make. The earthquake claimed Da's left arm, leaving him physically disabled. Rather than taking his university entrance exams, Da opts to make it on his own by transporting people with his bike. He leaves his mother in Tangshan and eventually becomes the boss of a successful travel agency. He marries and has a son, named Dian Dian. After a four-year absence, Deng goes back to see her adopted father with her daughter, also named Dian Dian. She apologises and makes up with her father, finally admitting that she remembers everything that happened during the earthquake. She tells him about her mother's decision, and says that she will never forget how she was abandoned. Then on New Year's Eve, Deng tells her adopted father that she is getting married to a foreigner, who is 16 years older than she is and is emigrating to Vancouver, Canada with her daughter. In 2008, Deng sees the earthquake in Sichuan on TV. She immediately volunteers to join rescuers in the wake of the Sichuan earthquake and returns to China. Unknowingly, at the same time, her long-lost brother has also decided to help volunteer in the rescue efforts. While taking a break, the sister overhears a stranger  talking about his past experiences in the Tangshan earthquake, and quickly realizes that it is her brother. It is assumed that she reunites herself with her brother, and they both decide to visit their mother. At first Deng is angry at her mother for abandoning her, and thinks that her mother hated her and that is why she chose her brother over her, but after all three of them went to visit their father's grave and her grave , she realized that despite her being ""dead"", her mother had been buying two sets of all the school workbooks; one for her brother and one for her. At this point, she realized the remorse, emotional agony and guilt that her mother had gone through for the past 32 years and finally she forgives her mother. The family is reunited after 32 years of separation. The screen then cuts to a stone memorial in Tangshan. Carved into the stone are the names of all 240,000 victims of the earthquake. A single elderly man is seen looking up at a name, then biking away. During all this, the subtitles reveal that this man had been visiting this memorial every year. He had lost all of his family in the earthquake. Of the five people, he was the only survivor. The camera follows him, as he rides past walls and walls of names all carved in with gold lettering.http://twitchfilm.net/news/2010/04/first-teaser-for-feng-xiaogangs-disaster-drama-aftershock.php"

Soon there are only Commander Karza and Lieutenant Centauri 7 left. Centauri wants to kill the alien and be done with it, but the Commander insists that he be taken alive, regardless of the mounting cost. The two engage each other in a tense standoff, as Centauri demands to know why the prisoner is so important. The commander then reveals that the prisoner is the only survivor of its kind, whose planet was destroyed in war, and that he ""plans to return the favor."" The standoff is interrupted when the commander is killed by a sniper shot. The prisoner has a clear shot at Centauri as well, but declines for reasons not yet known, and moves off. Centauri begins to track the beacon implanted into the prisoner’s body, but when he finds it, it's another trap. The prisoner has torn the device out of his own flesh, and left it as a decoy to sneak up and ambush him. After knocking the Sedonian unconscious, the prisoner rummages through his gear until he finds a tool to cut off the ""inhibitor mask,"" thus revealing himself as a human. The human steals Centauri’s gear and water, but leaves him alive. The human also steals Centauri's communication device and tries to access the Sedonian computer database through it. He is denied access, but he is still able to communicate with Centauri via the communicators. The two exchange a few words, in which the human fails to persuade Centauri to abort the mission and go back. There are a few narrow escapes and near captures of the human. During a lull in the chase, the human chats with Centauri, in the conversation, it is revealed that the Earth was destroyed because humans accepted refugees of a Sedonian enemy. Centauri announces for the second time that he will not stop until he kills the human. During a chase of the human, an inter-planetary bounty hunter is able to take the human captive. The bounty hunter begins to drag the human back to the ship with intent to cash in on the human's reward set by the Sedonians. Centari intercepts the bounty hunter and engages in battle with him. During the fray, the human escapes. Centauri finally captures his prey, Lieutenant Orin Jericho. He then calls for extraction, and sits down to wait. With bound hands and feet, Jericho criticizes the atrocities of the Sedonians, in a heated conversation with Centauri. But Centauri sees nothing wrong with enslaving other races and destroying anyone who opposes, as he calls it, ""our way of life."" After learning from Jericho that the humans have launched a cloaked ship, loaded with enough explosives to destroy the Sedonian homeworld, Centauri appeals to Jericho's sense of honor, and asks him to spare the lives of the innocent Sedonians who will be killed. He asks, ""Is that what you want the legacy of your kind to be?"" Jericho appears to relent, and wants to reveal the coordinates of the ship. Centauri orders his comlink to recognize Jericho as an authorized user, so that he can give the coordinates to ""Alpha Base."" The ship is quickly located, and Centauri is ordered to kill Jericho, since he is no longer needed. But, then Jericho reveals to Centauri, that the ship was a decoy. Jericho tells Centauri that there is nothing he can do, he has been playing for time, and now it is too late to save Sedonia. This thought distracts Centauri enough to allow Jericho to cut himself loose. Jericho defeats Centauri in a bit of hand to hand fighting and escapes again, now leaving him tied up. At this point, Jericho reveals that the bomb ship was in fact, never launched. Earth did not even know the location of Sedonia. His purpose all along was to force the crash, on this particular planet, and trick one of the Sedonians into giving him access to a comlink, so that he could use it to upload Sedonia's coordinates to the bomb ship. As he's leaving, he goes back to Centauri and says: ""Do you want to know the difference between me and you?"" as Centauri is trying to untie himself, Orin says ""I did have a wife and a son back on Earth."" Which has Centauri in a short period  thinking about that statement. Now disguised in Centauri's armor, he eliminates the arriving Sedonian extraction team, just as Centauri breaks loose from his bindings. Jericho proceeds to move towards a hidden hatch, buried in the sand. Before he can enter the hatch, Centauri has a clear shot at him, but now Centauri declines. He watches through a scope as Jericho drops into the hatch.  Jericho proceeds down the hatch, and launches in the bomb-ship hidden under the desert, only to discover that the AI chip has been plucked out of the comlink by Centauri, he cannot use it. Centauri finds the corpses of the extraction team, and snaps his own AI chip into one of their comlinks. He then responds rather rudely to a call from Alpha Base. Jericho monitors this communication from the ship, and the comlink warns Centauri that he doesn't have much time before the human traces the signal back to Sedonia. Centauri looks to the sky and says ""He already has. Isn't that right, Earthman?"" Then they both agree that they have something to talk about when they meet again, and Centauri begins to look for the bounty hunter's ship."

He asks, ""Is that what you want the legacy of your kind to be?"" Jericho appears to relent, and wants to reveal the coordinates of the ship. Centauri orders his comlink to recognize Jericho as an authorized user, so that he can give the coordinates to ""Alpha Base."" The ship is quickly located, and Centauri is ordered to kill Jericho, since he is no longer needed. But, then Jericho reveals to Centauri, that the ship was a decoy. Jericho tells Centauri that there is nothing he can do, he has been playing for time, and now it is too late to save Sedonia. This thought distracts Centauri enough to allow Jericho to cut himself loose. Jericho defeats Centauri in a bit of hand to hand fighting and escapes again, now leaving him tied up. At this point, Jericho reveals that the bomb ship was in fact, never launched. Earth did not even know the location of Sedonia. His purpose all along was to force the crash, on this particular planet, and trick one of the Sedonians into giving him access to a comlink, so that he could use it to upload Sedonia's coordinates to the bomb ship. As he's leaving, he goes back to Centauri and says: ""Do you want to know the difference between me and you?"" as Centauri is trying to untie himself, Orin says ""I did have a wife and a son back on Earth."" Which has Centauri in a short period  thinking about that statement. Now disguised in Centauri's armor, he eliminates the arriving Sedonian extraction team, just as Centauri breaks loose from his bindings. Jericho proceeds to move towards a hidden hatch, buried in the sand. Before he can enter the hatch, Centauri has a clear shot at him, but now Centauri declines. He watches through a scope as Jericho drops into the hatch.  Jericho proceeds down the hatch, and launches in the bomb-ship hidden under the desert, only to discover that the AI chip has been plucked out of the comlink by Centauri, he cannot use it. Centauri finds the corpses of the extraction team, and snaps his own AI chip into one of their comlinks. He then responds rather rudely to a call from Alpha Base. Jericho monitors this communication from the ship, and the comlink warns Centauri that he doesn't have much time before the human traces the signal back to Sedonia. Centauri looks to the sky and says ""He already has. Isn't that right, Earthman?"" Then they both agree that they have something to talk about when they meet again, and Centauri begins to look for the bounty hunter's ship."

His wife , his mother , and his friend  provide support, but they can't fully understand the pain and suffering he feels since his tour of duty ended. Lonely, James reconnects with an army buddy, Raymond , who provides him with compassion and friendship during his battle to process his experiences in Iraq. But their reunion also exposes the different ways that war affects people, at least on the surface. This moving story of redemption and reconstruction extends beyond a post-traumatic-stress-disorder narrative. O'Nan's performance is moving as he explores the depths of his internal struggle; Ferrera fearlessly tackles her role of a young wife in turmoil. The Dry Land is about one man's fight within his own terrain, his country, his home, and his mental health. He fights to rebuild what he lost.

He intends to force his daughter to honor the promise to marry the son  of the literary minister Wu so that he can obtain gifts of money. Million realizes that Pearl is not his daughter, but as she is suffering from amnesia, he decides to adopt the girl in place of Ying. Wu's eldest daughter, Yau, is hot-tempered and practical woman.

John Hayes is asked to take charge of the Overland stagecoach line, which makes eastbound gold shipments from California that aid the Union's war effort. Hayes travels to Overland headquarters in his hometown of Julesburg, Colorado. He meets a Union soldier, Rod Miller, who has lost an arm, and Miller's wife, Jeannie. Clay Putnam has quit his position with Overland and is now secretly working for the Confederacy. He has the support of a quick-draw bandit, Mace, and also has married Hayes' former love, Norma. Mace's men pick a fight with the one-armed Miller, calling him ""half a man"" and raising Jeannie's ire. Rod is distraught at his condition, unable to even cock a pistol now. Hayes decides to ask the Millers if they would agree to run the local Overland station out of their farm. Mace wants to kill Hayes, but is talked out of it by Putnam, who fears the Union's response. He orders Mace's men to destroy Overland's stations and property instead and steal its deliveries of gold. Putnam is jealous of Hayes, though, believing Norma is still interested in him. He decides to kill him, but mistakes Rod for Hayes and shoots the wrong man. Mace drives a stagecoach off a cliff, killing passengers, including women and children. A disgusted Norma decides to leave Putnam and warns she will see him hang if anything should happen to Hayes. A final confrontation in town results in townspeople offering Hayes their help. Putnam also comes looking for Mace, but is shot, whereupon Mace is killed by Hayes. Norma hopes to rekindle Hayes' love for her, but he appears more likely to have a future with Jeannie."

His fit makes Doraemon angry, and with the hot Japanese summer, he decides to ""cool off"" at the North Pole with the Anywhere Door, a mysterious portal. Nobita follows him there after he's gone for a long time, and discovers a strange bowling ball-like orb which starts blinking with a pulsating light, and summons what looks like a giant robot´s foot. After sledding down the hill on it and having it crash into his room through the Anywhere Door, the bowling ball follows him home through the door and another robot piece falls into his backyard. Doraemon, who returned covered in ice, thaws out and wakes up with a cold. When Nobita thanks him for summoning up the parts for a giant robot for him, Doraemon is astonished and admits that he knows nothing about them. However, using a combination of the Opposite World Entrance Oil and the Roll-Up Fishing Hole, they go to the ""World Inside the Mirror""  and build the robot. Finally, Nobita dubs the robot ""Zanda Claus"", since he feels that the bowling ball that's summoning the parts was a gift from Santa Claus at the North Pole. Using a brain-wave controller that Doraemon pulls out of his pocket, he and Nobita play around with the robot, making it do gymnastic moves over bridges and such. Not to keep things to himself, Nobita returns home and brings Shizuka back with him to play with the robot together, but Shizuka presses a button on the control panel that makes the robot fire a huge laser beam, resulting in the destruction of half of the city. Seeing this, they group realizes just how dangerous ""Zanda Claus"" really is, so they decide to return to the real world and forget about ever finding the robot. However, Nobita forgot about the bowling ball-like orb he brought back with him, which has been sending telepathic messages to a mysterious girl named Riruru. She is the owner of Zanda Claus, and is looking to reclaim it. Following the orb's messages, she seeks out Nobita, who accidentally lets slip that he knows about the robot. Lilulu proceeds to force him into showing her where it is, so Nobita borrows the Roll-Up Fishing Hole from the spare pocket Doraemon keeps in the closet and takes her to the World Inside the Mirror. She reclaims Zanda Claus, and asks Nobita if she can borrow the Roll-Up Fishing Hole for a while, to which Nobita agrees. Nobita is visibly nervous about what she is up to, and curious about seeing two shooting stars in a row, so he uses the Bamboo 'Copter to fly over and see what's going on. Flying over the forest by Mt. Ura, he discovers the Roll-Up Fishing Hole unrolled with a portal to the World Inside the Mirror open. When another ""shooting star"" falls from the sky directly into the portal, Nobita follows it into the other world and discovers that it is one of the parts for building a massive robot army and that Lilulu is at the center of it all. Doraemon, who was suspicious of Nobita's peculiar behavior at home and had followed him there, uses a long-range Paper Cup Phone to listen in on her, and discovers that Lilulu is actually a robot who hates all humans. Upon Lilulu discovering that she was being listened in on, she chases after Nobita and Doraemon. After returning to their own world, Zanda Claus tries to get through the portal as well, resulting in its destruction; seemingly separating the two worlds forever. The two have completely forgotten about the bowling ball orb that is still at home, however. It then wakes up, and starts bouncing around. So Doraemon pulls out a special kind of incubator and puts the bowling ball and Doraemon's Translation Jelly in it, causing the bowling ball to hatch into a cute yellow peep the group names ""Pippo"".  He warns Nobita of a giant robot army who are involved in a plot to enslave all humanity, so that robot-kind can take over the Earth. Many things happen, resulting in Nobita becoming good friends with Pippo, and Shizuka taking care of fixing Lilulu when she gets very badly damaged. As Lilulu had some traumatic experiences as a child, however, she holds a very deep distrust and resentment towards humans, and the only one she really feels connected with is Pippo, whom she fixed ""on a whim"" after he was broken by the other robots. Even after everything Nobita and the others did for her, Lilulu still proceeds to shoot Nobita with a laser beam from her finger. Pippo jumps in front of Nobita and becomes very badly injured. His injuries give Lilulu a wake-up call, so she changes her mind and decides that she is not going to tell the robot leader why there are no humans on the planet nor where they are. The rest of the robot army chain her up for her heresy to her people, and tortures her to try and get her to spill what she knows. Nobita, Doraemon, and the rest of the gang show up with Zanda Claus and rescue her. Back in the real world, Lilulu describes that she is having an inner conflict with herself and doesn't know what she wants, so she willingly lets Doraemon lock her up in a bird cage using the Small Light. In the meantime, the robot army get further suspicious because of there being no humans in the world. They then discover that they are in a fake world upon analyzing the satellite image of the world and the same image of the current world and seeing how they are reversed. The robot army discovers the newly-made portal the Doraemon and others made to get back to the fake world and follow it back to the real world, leaving Nobita, Doraemon, Gian, Suneo, and Pippo to fight together to stop them from destroying the planet, while Shizuka is left in the World Inside the Mirror, watching the tiny Lilulu with Doraemon's spare pocket. As the team is gearing up for battle, Shizuka talks with Lilulu, which gives her a great idea. She enlarges Lilulu with the Big Light, uses the Walk-In Mirror to go back to the real world, takes the Anywhere Door to Nobita's room, and takes the Time Machine in Nobita's desk drawer back to thirty thousand years ago when a Professor was creating two robots with human-like hearts and feelings that could save everyone and stop the robot army before it starts. In the original timeline, the professor died before finishing them, but thanks to Shizuka and Lilulu's intervention, Lilulu inputs the warm, loving feelings she got from Nobita and his friends into the Professor's computer, completes them, and erases the evil robot army from the time stream thirty thousand years in the future. All of them believe that Lilulu and Pippo will also be erased as they were also created for the war against the humans. But then another story starts, when a video clip was shown automatically from the eyes of Lilulu, that she and Pipo were created and sent by another planet's king to stop the future wars. But eventually the king of the evil robot army erased their memories and used both of them as a weapons against humanity. In the end, Lilulu and Pippo return to their own planet and kept visiting Nobita and Doraemon as real human friends."

Swerving to avoid hitting the man, Brent's vehicle collides with a tree. Six months later, Brent is planning to attend a high school dance with girlfriend Holly , having refused an offer by Lola Stone . Holly drives the pair on account of the car crash: it is revealed that Brent's father died in the accident. Wracked with guilt, Brent has turned to recreational cannabis use and self-mutilation with a razor blade he keeps on a necklace. While listening to music, Brent is attacked from behind. Bound to a chair, he wakes up at Lola's house sitting at a table with Lola, her father , and a lobotomized woman they call Bright Eyes . Lola's father has turned his house into a dance for his daughter. Lola takes a syringe and fills it with bleach and injects it into Brent's voice box making him unable to scream or talk. She begins torturing Brent by forcing him to suck on her finger and threatening to nail his penis to the chair when he cannot urinate. When she makes a threatening comment about Holly, Brent kicks Lola and manages to escape outside. Lola's father chases Brent up a tree, where he and Lola hurl rocks at Brent, knocking him down. The two bring Brent back inside, and nail his feet to the floor with knives. Lola reveals via a scrap book that she has been abducting many boys throughout her life, including the bloody man, who turns out to be the brother of Mia, the goth girl his friend Jamie asked to the prom. This was the man that Brent saw which made him swerve and kill his father. Lola then ""draws"" on Brent by carving a heart with ""L S"" in the middle on his chest on which she liberally throws salt. After being crowned Queen of her dance, Lola admits to Brent that she is looking for her prince, which is not Brent as he is ""just another frog"". However, Lola confides in her father that he himself is her prince. Afterward, Daddy lifts the carpet to reveal a secret trapdoor with the previous abductees still inside. Lola drills a hole through Brent's skull as they intend to lobotomize him like their other captives. But when Lola complains that the hole is too small for her to pour boiling water into, Brent slashes her father with his pendant necklace. Brent then attacks Daddy, stabbing him repeatedly in the neck with the knives Brent pulled out of his feet. Lola jumps on Brent and tries to hit him, but Brent knocks her out. Brent then pushes Lola's dad into the pit, where he watches in horror as the near-starved captives eat Daddy. Lola gets up and throws Brent in, throwing nearby objects at him in anger. Brent finds a flashlight and hammer that Lola had thrown down, and kills the abductees as they advance on him. Lola then goes and smothers Bright Eyes with a pillow, revealing that the woman is her mother. On a hunch, Holly calls a policeman  in the neighborhood. When he gets to Lola's house, he sees through a window the bloody floor and chair and breaks in. Brent in an attempt to attract the policeman's attention makes noise by throwing objects at the doors, alerting the policeman of his presence. But when he opens the doors, Lola appears behind the policeman and Brent cannot say anything to warn him. Lola drives a meat cleaver into his face and the policeman falls down, dropping his gun. Brent attempts to shoot Lola, but she quickly moves out of the way where she finds Brent's necklace. She then informs Brent that she is going to go to his house and kill his mother Carla and Holly for murdering her father and breaking her heart. Brent notices a large pile of bones in the pit. That gives him the idea to pile up the dead bodies, and he manages to climb out. Lola begins walking on the road with a knife and her scrap book when she sees a car advance. It is shown to be Holly, so Lola hides and throws her book at the windshield, distracting Holly to a halt. She then attempts to kill Holly, but Holly evades Lola and a chase ensues. Brent is seen driving the police car fast attempting to catch up with Lola. He sees Holly and nearly hits her but swerves and hits Lola instead. Holly clambers into the police car, and is shocked to see Brent. The two embrace tearfully as Lola, severely injured but still not dead, crawls to kill the pair. They hear the noise of Lola's knife as she drags herself and Brent reverses the car, striking Lola in the head and crushing her skull. Brent and Holly arrive back home. Carla looks outside the window to see her son in a brutal state and embraces him after all the horror he has been through. The last scene shown is that of Brent's face as he is being held by Carla, looking on."

He tests it out on eight yellow jackets, to see how well it works. It kills six, out of the eight wasps, and the two who survived now have extremely high pheromone levels, resulting in increased aggression. That night, the janitor  accidentally releases them, and they both attack, and kill, him. The next morning, they find his body, along with one of the wasps, with the other one nowhere to be found. His body is taken to the morgue, where the mortician , hears a buzzing, from the janitors mouth, and opens it, freeing the, somehow, trapped wasp. It then proceeds to sting him, until he is dead. It then flys away. Meanwhile, Cristina Brown , a scientist, is teaching a class about bees. One young man,  relates to her a story about how he was once stung by a wasp, and suddenly six or seven other wasps attacked him. She tells him that was because when an insect attacks, it releases an attack pheromone, which tells all the other insects that they need to attack. The class is cut short, when she is called in about the mortician. Agent Doug Heydon,  tells her about Kent, and his research. She decides to go investigate. Meanwhile, Q  a bug exterminator, who is friends with Kent, is called by a family, who has a bad yellow jacket problem. He is out of pesticide, and goes to Kent to get some. Kent tells him not to take any of the new pesticide, in the red bottles, but a curious Q mixes it with the regular solution. As he sprays the nest, the results come back, of the analysis, of the hyper-aggressive wasp's venom. It has been learned that the venom is now incredibly strong, due to the new pesticide. Meanwhile, the Chief of Police , blackmails, Mayor Gibson , with evidence that he has been making covert meetings, with Phineas Washburn , a man who owns Washburn's Tasty Sauce, a company that makes a delicious steak sauce. It turns out Washburn made a large financial contribution to Gibson's reelection campaign. The Chief tells Gibson that he wants a large donation to his 401, before he retires. He leaves, with Gibson furious Meanwhile, Q puts the sprayed nest in his trash compactor, but about one quarter, of the nest, survives, including the queen. They chase Q to his truck, where he administers anti-venom, before passing out. The wasps then leave, and begin sending off attack pheromones, which, not only attract multiple other swarms, but also mutate them, to have extremely potent venom, as well. Meanwhile, Cristina and Kent, go to the home of a man who was stung to death, by the swarm, because they were attracted to the raw meat patties, on his grill. They find a dead wasp, on his clothes, and take it back to the lab, for analysis. Meanwhile, Q is awoken, by Rafe , the teenager he's watching for the summer. He and Rafe decide to go find and kill the swarm themselves. Back at the lab, the venom results show that the potency is identical to the strength of the wasp, that killed the janitor. They go tell Agent Heydon, and they all agree that the annual burger cook-off will attract the wasps right to all the people. Heydon goes to tell the Chief, as they go to tell Washburn that they have to cancel the cook-off. However, neither of them believe them, and are told not to mess the cook-off. Just after Heydon leaves the Chief, the swarm is attracted to his rare steak, and kill him, when he fights back. Eventually, Q and Rafe find the part of the swarm that stayed behind to finish off, the steak, with the pheromone detector, that Q took from Kent. Q uses a flamethrower to kill the swarm, but melts part of his van, in the process. Meanwhile, the single wasp that first killed the janitor, finds its way to Mayor Gibson's office, and kills him, by stinging his eye. His assistant, Ellie Martin,  finds his body, and chases the wasp, with a shotgun, eventually killing it. Kent and Cristina come, and ask her if she killed it. She says she ""blew it to Kingdom Come."" The cook-off then starts, and Heydon comes to try to convince Washburn, that they have to shut it down. But before he can, the swarm arrives, and begins attacking people. They kill a woman, Melanie Sheer , a mean reporter, while her camera man, Chuey , video tapes. Washburn hides in a dunk tank, but gets killed when two wasps, crawl down the hose that he is breathing through, and sting his mouth. Eventually, Kent and Cristina show up, and begin administering anti-venom, to the stung, and use tire patching spray, to close up the wasps' breathing holes. Q also arrives and begins attracting the wasps to a golf cart, to trap them inside a garage. While he does so, Kent, Cristina, and Rafe begin gathering petrol tanks, and gasoline, so as to destroy the wasps, altogether. Q manages to get the wasps inside, and they ignite the gas, with Rafe's lighter. But the queen survives, and goes after Q, but is sucked up by Rafe, with the portable vacuum cleaner he was given, to vacuum up the dead wasps. He then throws it, into the fire. We then see Kent and Cristina, who are now in a relationship, going to dinner. The camera then zooms up to the charred vacuum, as we see the queen, who somehow survived, laying eggs."

They go tell Agent Heydon, and they all agree that the annual burger cook-off will attract the wasps right to all the people. Heydon goes to tell the Chief, as they go to tell Washburn that they have to cancel the cook-off. However, neither of them believe them, and are told not to mess the cook-off. Just after Heydon leaves the Chief, the swarm is attracted to his rare steak, and kill him, when he fights back. Eventually, Q and Rafe find the part of the swarm that stayed behind to finish off, the steak, with the pheromone detector, that Q took from Kent. Q uses a flamethrower to kill the swarm, but melts part of his van, in the process. Meanwhile, the single wasp that first killed the janitor, finds its way to Mayor Gibson's office, and kills him, by stinging his eye. His assistant, Ellie Martin,  finds his body, and chases the wasp, with a shotgun, eventually killing it. Kent and Cristina come, and ask her if she killed it. She says she ""blew it to Kingdom Come."" The cook-off then starts, and Heydon comes to try to convince Washburn, that they have to shut it down. But before he can, the swarm arrives, and begins attacking people. They kill a woman, Melanie Sheer , a mean reporter, while her camera man, Chuey , video tapes. Washburn hides in a dunk tank, but gets killed when two wasps, crawl down the hose that he is breathing through, and sting his mouth. Eventually, Kent and Cristina show up, and begin administering anti-venom, to the stung, and use tire patching spray, to close up the wasps' breathing holes. Q also arrives and begins attracting the wasps to a golf cart, to trap them inside a garage. While he does so, Kent, Cristina, and Rafe begin gathering petrol tanks, and gasoline, so as to destroy the wasps, altogether. Q manages to get the wasps inside, and they ignite the gas, with Rafe's lighter. But the queen survives, and goes after Q, but is sucked up by Rafe, with the portable vacuum cleaner he was given, to vacuum up the dead wasps. He then throws it, into the fire. We then see Kent and Cristina, who are now in a relationship, going to dinner. The camera then zooms up to the charred vacuum, as we see the queen, who somehow survived, laying eggs."

But the Castle is haunted by the spirit of a disgraced ancestor, Sir Simon de Canterville, doomed to remain on the estate after the death of his wife; his goal is to send the family packing so he begins a ghostly reign of terror: reappearing bloodstains, clanking chains, haunting moans. As is revealed by Lord Canterville  and the servants Mr and Mrs Umney, numerous people have stayed at Canterville Hall in the last few years and have all been scared away by Sir Simon - the locals start betting on how long the Otis family will stay. Virginia 'Ginny' Otis, the daughter, starts to get suspicious when it becomes apparent that the mysterious noises are not her younger brothers playing tricks and discovers a mysterious prophecy in a book about the house's history. She also discovers a secret passage in the library that leads to a cell where Sir Simon resides during the day with his raven familiar Gabriel. Initially disliking the house and life in England, Ginny starts to appreciate her new home and becomes attracted to Francis, the young Duke of Cheshire, who has also seen Sir Simon's ghost. Unfortunately, Hiram does not believe in ghosts and accuses Ginny of trying to scare the family so they'll return to America. Sir Simon becomes infuriated by the family's resilience and is himself scared by a fake ghost that the boys built. Angrily chasing the Otis children, Sir Simon causes Ginny to get in even more trouble with her father - who is so sceptical he can't even see Sir Simon. Ginny uses the secret passage to return to the cell and yells at the ghost for getting her in trouble, but ultimately ends up befriending him. Later, Francis takes a walk with Ginny and explains that Sir Simon was suspected of murdering his wife Lady Eleanor and his fate remains unknown. He and Ginny eventually separate in the Canterville chapel, but Sir Simon appears to the tearful Ginny and advises her to not let her fears ruin her chances of finding true love. Ginny follows his advice and makes her feelings apparent to Francis. Hiram, still blaming Ginny for the strange happenings, decides to send Ginny back home to America. Going to Sir Simon for help, Ginny also explains how her father doesn't believe in ghosts  and they plot to trick Hiram into believing. They will perform a scene from Shakespeare's Hamlet and Sir Simon will play the ghost of Hamlet's father . During the performance, however, Sir Simon suddenly chickens out and disappears halfway through the scene - even worse, Hiram insists it was a special effect . Ginny sneaks back to the cell that night and discovers that the lines of the play brought back sad memories for Sir Simon. He confesses that he drove his wife insane after being tricked into thinking she had been unfaithful and that Lady Eleanor killed herself. Surrendering himself to Eleanor's family for punishment, Sir Simon was locked in the cell to starve and cursed by a witch, who condemned him to haunt the house by night and lament the death of his wife by day - Sir Simon has not slept for centuries and can only rest if he is redeemed and allowed to pass on. Ginny wants to help him, so Sir Simon takes her to the library and reveals that she has already fulfilled part of the prophecy, she has wept for him. Next, she must pray for him. Finally, Sir Simon takes her through a portal in the fireplace to the ""Realm of Darkness"" to plead to the Angel of Death on his behalf. The next morning, Hiram goes to Ginny's bedroom to try to make amends and discovers she isn't there. Panicking, the family search the house and estate aided by Francis, the Umneys, Lord Canterville and the locals. They find the cloak Ginny was wearing last night in the library and everyone but Hiram realises that Ginny has been taken away by the ghost. Hiram starts to hear Ginny's voice in his mind and sees her image in Sir Simon's portrait, causing him to start believing in ghosts. That night, they hear a mysterious noise and rush to the library, where the fireplace opens again to reveal Ginny trying to get home from the Realm of Darkness - her family and Francis rescue her before the portal closes. Ginny takes the family to Sir Simon's cell and they find his chained skeleton. Gabriel disappears, no longer needed, and they hear the chapel bell  ring out. Outside, a dead almond tree comes back to life and blooms, fulfilling the prophecy and confirming that Sir Simon is redeemed. The family decide to stay at Canterville indefinitely, with the blessing of Lord Canterville  and have Sir Simon's remains buried in the garden beside Lady Eleanor's. Francis and Ginny visit the grave and Ginny thanks Sir Simon for everything he taught her about life, death and how love is stronger than both. Ghostly voices are heard, implying that Sir Simon has been reunited with his wife and is finally happy. A classic story of redemption and forgiveness, told through a comic lens.

When she arrives home, she finds that someone had already switched it off. Eventually dismissing it as a lapse of memory, she continues her daily routine of taking care of her two daughters and working on her next painting. She soon meets Mara, her husband's new co-worker, at a party. Mara and Sophie leave the party and go to the beach, where they talk. Mara tells Sophie that she was sorry to hear that her mother had died recently. She also tells Sophie that she lost her best friend Kate, who had been working with orphans in Kosovo, after someone threw a Molotov cocktail through the window of the orphanage. Over the next few weeks items, including a dress, begin to go missing from Sophie's house. She comes to suspect that Mara is stealing her belongings after seeing her in the same dress, but has no evidence. Sophie then breaks into Mara's house to collect proof, but gets caught and is given a restraining order. Sophie's husband does not back her up in court. Sophie then thinks that her husband may be having an affair with Mara, but he is quick to shrug it off. She goes to rent a cabin, as suggested by her husband, to spend time alone and clear her mind. She also spends time with her father, and in a conversation between the two it is revealed that Sophie became pregnant at the age of eighteen and the baby had been sent to a children's home.

He has been troubled by recurring nightmares, and has been seeing psychiatrist Dr. Geraldine ""Geri"" Bennett  to diagnosis them. At school, Nathan is teamed with his next-door neighbor and longtime friend, Karen Murphy  for a research project on missing children. As they work, Karen discovers a website that uses age-progression technology to see how a child would look like as they got older. Nathan uses a photo of Steven Price, a child that has been missing since 3, and finds the resemblance to himself uncanny. Worried, he goes back home and looks through his childhood possessions and finds a shirt that matches the one in Steven's photo, including a unique stain. He attempts to make contact with the operator of the website with Steven's picture to learn more. While waiting for a return feedback, he finds more oddities about his childhood, including that his parents only appear to have a handful of pictures of him growing up. When he approaches Mara about this, she emotionally reveals that he was adopted. While Nathan angrily returns to his room, two men, claiming to be from the FBI arrive. Mara immediately attacks them, but soon is shot by one of the men. Kevin, alerted by the battle, subdues one of the men, but is killed while telling Nathan to run. Nathan runs but returns for Karen, who is now captured by the remaining agent. Nathan rescues her and demands the agent explain who he is. The agent agrees to talk but says there's a bomb in the oven. Sure enough, there it is, with 8 seconds left. Nathan and Karen race outdoors and are blown into the pool, which saves them from the enormous fireball. Nathan takes Karen to the hospital for a minor cut, while he attempts to contact the police. Instead, his call is intercepted by CIA operative Frank Burton , who tells Nathan he is danger and will send two men to collect him. As Nathan waits, Dr. Bennett appears with a bunch of balloons, and helps him and Karen to escape without being seen by the security cameras. In her car, Dr. Bennett explains that Nathan's biological father, Martin , stole an encrypted list of 25 corrupt CIA operatives from the Serbian terrorist Nikola Kozlow ; Kozlow now plans on abducting Nathan to coerce Martin to hand over the list. Nathan has been purposely given to his adoptive parents to hide him from Kozlow, but his identity was revealed after using the missing child website, a ruse created by Kozlow. Dr. Bennett gives Nathan an address to a safehouse in Arlington, Virginia, and tells him to trust only two others, his father Martin and a man named Paul Rasmus. She provides a distraction from Kozlow's men who are following them to allow Nathan and Karen to escape. Meanwhile, Burton is warned by his superior to end the situation as soon as possible once he learns of Bennett, a former CIA operative, being involved. Arriving at the safehouse, the two regroup, and find money, a gun, a photo of Nathan's biological mother Lorna Price , and a cell phone. After learning that Lorna has died, Nathan and Karen pay a visit to her grave, and are surprised to find fresh flowers there. Karen sweettalks the graveyard attendant to reveal the sender, a Paul Rasmus who lives in Nebraska. Knowing that they would be stopped at an airport, the two take to a passenger train to get there, using fake ID provided by their friend Gilly . They are unaware they are followed by Kozlow's right-hand man aboard the train. He abducts Karen as she goes for food, and when Nathan finds her absent, is able to defend himself from his attack. Nathan gets the upper hand using fighting techniques from his adoptive father, and subdues the man, and then pushes him out from the train after taking his cell phone. Nathan finds Karen safe but soon the train abruptly stops due to the CIA. The two take off on foot but soon surrounded by Burton and his agents. Burton offers a meal at a diner to the two while he discusses the situation with them, all the while other CIA agents are posted as guard. Burton explains the data that Martin had stolen, and Nathan realizes that the phone from the safehouse contains that data; he also further summizes that Burton's name is on that list. As Burton tries to play that off, the agents are attacked by Kozlow's snipers. In the distraction, Nathan and Karen take off in a car before they can be caught. As they flee, the cell phone from Kozlow's man rings. Nathan finds Kozlow on the line, who warns him that he will kill Karen's parents if Nathan does not hand over the data. Nathan gets Kozlow to agree to make the transaction at a public event, at a Pittsburg Pirates baseball game. During this call, Nathan realizes that he had witnessed his mother's death at Kozlow's hands when he was 3, the source of his nightmares. Nathan works with Gilly to arrange the tickets, including securing a hidden gun to one of the seats with the intent to kill Kozlow himself. As he enters the stadium, Martin calls him and warns him off, but Nathan refuses to listen. Meanwhile, when Kozlow arrives, Karen, in hiding, takes a photograph and sends it to Nathan so he can recognize Kozlow. The two meet, sit and watch the game. Kozlow tells how Nathan's biomom died. Kozlow grabs the gun when Nathan is distracted and demands the list. Nathan bolts, Kozlow chases, and the CIA sees them in the crowd. Nathan is able to escape, and Martin, calling again, directs him to lead Kozlow to the south side of the park. Kozlow eventually catches up with Nathan but before he can kill the boy, Kozlow is killed by Martin, using a sniper rifle from a nearby parking structure. Burton, his superior, and the rest of his agents soon arrive, taking away Kozlow's body. Burton asks for the cell phone, promising to give the decrypted results to his superior; however, Martin had warned his superior about Burton's corruption, and takes the phone himself while Burton is taken into custody. Martin called Nathan one last time, apologizing for not being the father he should have been but will continue to watch over him. Bennett arrives with Karen, and says she has arranged for Nathan to live with her until he decides what to pursue in his life. As the movie ends, Nathan and Karen go on a long-awaited date in the empty ballpark."

He is excited about moving in, until his friend Thomas points out that the house is dripping blood onto him. Alex is nonchalant about this, saying that it is just the house's paint job, although Thomas observes that nothing is painted this color. They ignore this, but after more blood drips on Alex later, the pair agree to approach the landlord to report the ""leak"". The next day, they discover that the landlord's office is vacant, and it looks like it has not been used in years. Alex finds this odd, saying that the office was open yesterday. Alex hopes the landlord will call him and explain the dripping blood, but starts to worry as the problem continues. Thomas explains the whole story to his friend Bobby the next day. When Alex meets up with them, Thomas offers Alex a place to stay until the problem stops. Alex declines, saying that he is not going to let some ""leak"" make him move. Later, Alex goes up to the attic to investigate the source of the blood. He discovers his own dead body on the attic floor, causing him to panic. The film cuts to the present day, where the old man finishes his story. The previews start, and the first trailer is for a horror film called ""3 Blood Street"" that has the same plot as the old man's story. When both girls look at the old man, he has become a skeleton, causing the girls to scream."

As soon as she is cornered by a horde of zombies, fellow stripper Lena Jodo  arrives to kill the zombies with a chainsaw. During the attack, the chainsaw stops working and Lena is about to be killed by the zombies, only to be saved after Ginko fends them off with a katana. Lena is eventually successful at getting the chainsaw to work and begins to fend off the remaining zombies. The film cuts to several days earlier where Ginko and Lena are working in an unsuccessful strip club called Paradise Ikagawa Theatre with several other strippers. The most notable being Maria, an intelligent, red headed gothic bookworm with a penchant for self mutilation (along with a habit of quoting literary figures such as William Shakespeare., Lena, a forture telling stripper, and Darna, a stripper trying to raise enough money to see her siblings. Lena recounts what led her to the club. Several days ago, Lena returned from Mexico in desperate need of cash and goes to find work. However, she ends up getting drunk and breaking into a homeless man's cardboard box and sleeping with him. Hungover and disgusted by the discovery, Lena ditches him, steals his umbrella, and leaves while being yelled at by the homeless man over the stolen umbrella. Lena later receives a phone call from Manjiro, a deadbeat Ikagawa Promotions manager who owes the strippers a huge amount of money. Manjiro informs Lena that Ginko got arrested recently and that he will need a dancer to perform for ten days. Lena reluctantly accepts the offer due to her requiring shelter. Lena later meets up with Yudai, an employee of the strip club. Once they arrive, Yudai tells Lena about a man who attempted to build a spa resort, but was unsuccessful and led to his own family committing suicide with the spa resort being next to the strip club. Later, Yudai informs them that the theatre will be closed tomorrow. Nene interrogates Yudai about the payment and the strippers go to Manjiro after Yudai had no knowledge regarding the payment. Manjiro tries to lie his way out of the payment, but is unsuccessful. Agreeing to pay for the gig, Manjiro offers them a strip show gig at a spa resort. At the spa resort, Nene tells one of the spa workers they are with Ikagawa productions. However, the spa worker tells them that sex trade workers must come through the back door. In response Ginko informs them that they are dancers, not strippers or prostitutes. Later, the group performs a show for one of the spa attendees. Instead, the lead attendee insists on a sumo wrestling match between Lena and Ginko where the winner receives cash and the loser will be forced to be used as a human sushi bar. Lena wins the match while Ginko is reluctantly forced to become the human sushi bar. Lena ends up unintentionally sleeping with the lead spa attendee after getting drunk off red sake. Later, Ginko becomes angry with Lena's habit of sleeping with men when she gets drunk and the two of them start to fight, leading to both girls inadvertently ripping each other's shirts off and knocking down a stack of boxes. While cleaning up after the fight, Maria discovers a wooden door leading to an underground cellar of the run down spa resort. The strippers discover that the former owner had a collection of occult books, a hidden stash of yen bills , and a strange well called the Well of Spirits which has already been sealed off. While rummaging through the ex-owner's former belongings, a medieval Book of the Dead is discovered by Maria who was interested in the ex-owner's book collection. Believing she can use the book to perform necromancy, Maria chants several spells from the book, only to discover that it didn't work. Disappointed, Maria and the other girls leave the basement. What they didn't know however, was that Maria had accidentally released the undead from the Well of Spirits and the spell actually worked. While preparing dinner, Ginko and Nene discover that the spell worked and has caused all types of deceased life, including raw fish and sushi, to return back from the dead and terrorize Ikagawa. Meanwhile, Darna sneaks into the cellar where she had discovered the money, but soon discovers that a zombie was hidden underneath the pile of cash and is torn to pieces by zombies. Back in the dressing room, Ginko and Nene inform Lena and Maria about the zombie sushi incident, but are interrupted when they hear of a large audience outside. The audience, however, are revealed to be zombies who have recently killed Yudai. The zombies attack them and Nene is bitten by one of the zombies, but still manages to escape with Maria, Ginko and Lena. The zombies continue to emerge from the well and begin to slaughter the citizens of Ikagawa and eventually begin to spread all over Japan in a short manner of seconds according to a reporter who is devoured by several zombies. Although sharing the basic characteristics of infectious zombies, the zombies still retain their intelligence and intellect they had prior to being zombified. While cornered in the dressing room, Maria betrays Lena, Nene, and Ginko and escapes. Despite the betrayal, the three of them escape in the Ikagawa Paradise Theatre van, eventually driving to the spa resort where they had previously performed after the van was ruined when running over an elderly human. Ginko then reveals that she recognized a one eyed zombie amongst the crowd. She reveals that the zombie was a mentally disturbed murderer who killed Ginko's younger sister, but couldn't be touched legally due to being insane. This led a vengeful Ginko to kill the man by impaling him on an umbrella. Meanwhile, Maria returns to the abandoned spa's basement where she discovers the mutilated remains of Darna. The zombies attempt to kill Maria, who bribes them with flashing and candy. However, these attempts fail miserably. As a last resort, Maria chants a spell from the Book of the Dead and is successful at controlling them.

Even though no one else can understand it, Patricia grows closer to Marcus and when he is kicked out of his brother's home she invites him to stay with her, citing that he will be a positive male influence for her daughter. When Iris grows curious about what happened to her father, Patricia tearfully explains how he had murdered a police officer in retaliation for the murder of two Panthers.

Using the cover of a journalist named Hubert Delacroix, de La Bath flies to Brazil to meet his contact Thomas Ellis  who believes the killers have been drugged and hypnotised to perform their assassinations. At Rio de Janeiro, de La Bath is paged over the airport loudspeaker system by a woman who identifies herself as Consuela Moroni , Ellis's assistant. Noticing his being watched by two men who photograph him and Consuela's paging of him over the loudspeaker as a serious breach of secret agent protocol, de La Bath is suspicious. As Consuela takes him to a dockyard to meet Ellis, de La Bath takes the keys out of the car and leaves Consuela inside. His instincts are proved correct when he's attacked by three thugs, one who uses bolas as a weapon against him. De La Bath defeats the assassins with martial arts and their own bolas. Seeing the same two men from the airport watching him from a car, he uses a forklift truck to lift their car into the air. Consuela has vanished, but de La Bath has her car and drives to his hotel. On a car radio he hears that Ellis has been in a serious car accident and hospitalised. As he visits the hospital to see Ellis, he meets Anna-Maria . She flew Ellis to the hospital after his automobile accident outside her ranch in Bahia. An assassin disguised as a Doctor shoots Ellis on the operating table as well as some of the medical staff before OSS 117 throws him out a window. Anna-Maria gives OSS 117 Ellis's wallet that contains his address as well as a key ring. He takes Anna-Maria to her house in Rio where she is being watched. Visiting Ellis's address he meets the real Consuela  who knows little except that she fears for her life and doesn't have the key to Ellis's safe, however she arranges a meeting the next day with Ellis's associate in Rio near the Christ the Redeemer of the Andes statue. Returning to his hotel room the false Consuela/phony Moroni is in de La Bath's room and spends the night with him. Still suspicious, de La Bath leaves Consuela in bed as he goes to the toilet, playing a tape recording of him whistling and using the bathroom as he dresses and leaves out the window to reenter the room after the false Conseula has let two thugs in who attempt to kill de La Bath in his bath. De La Bath captures them and leaves all three bound and gagged on his bed. They remain like that until the water from de La Bath's bathtub that is still running floods the bathroom causing a guest below to complain to the management of his being soaked. The three are arrested by the Rio police. Prior to meeting Ellis's associate Carlos , de la Bath visits Anna-Maria who has been drugged with the suicide attack formula. She attempts to blow them both up with a hand grenade that de la Bath uses to dispatch the two thugs who drugged her. Carlos has the key to the safe and reveals that what caused Ellis's car ""accident"" was a friend in the front seat attempting to assassinate him with a hand grenade. Carlos accompanies OSS 117 back to Ellis's apartment where he waits outside to give warning. In the apartment the real Consuela has been murdered by the same two thugs at the airport and dockyard who are attempting to open the safe with an acetylene torch. They use it as a flamethrower to kill de la Bath but he kills them with it. Warned by Carlos of another group of assassins entering the building, de la Bath leaves the torch running filling the room with gas. He ignites it from a window as the group of assassins enter the room. Finding flowers in Ellis's safe that Ellis discovered to have been used to create the drug, de la Bath and Anne-Marie drive to her home in Bahia where another assassination attempt takes place by setting the road they are driving on aflame. Arriving at Anne-Marie's ranch courtesy of the unsuccessful assassin's vehicle, her friend Leandro  flies them to the remote region of the Indians who harvest the flowers. They discover the locale is the headquarters of a secret organisation of revolutionaries who wish to take over South America."

He learns that the outlaw couple Jack and Jill have the magic beans he's been looking for most of his life, beans that can lead him to a giant's castle holding valuable golden goose eggs. When Puss tries to steal them from the outlaws' room, Kitty interrupts, and both fail. Kitty is allied with Humpty Alexander Dumpty, a talking egg and Puss' long-estranged childhood friend from the orphanage where he was raised. Puss tells Kitty of his feelings of betrayal for a youthful misadventure when Humpty tricked Puss into helping commit a crime. Humpty convinces Puss to join them in finding the beans and retrieving the golden eggs. The trio steal the beans from Jack and Jill and plant them in the desert. Puss and Kitty's relationship becomes romantic. The trio ride the beanstalk into the clouds to find the castle of the late giant, while avoiding the Great Terror who guards the Golden Goose. When they realize the golden eggs are too heavy to carry, they steal the Goose, which is just a gosling, and escape the castle. While celebrating their victory, the group is ambushed by Jack and Jill, who knock Puss unconscious. When Puss wakes up, he tracks Jack and Jill to his old hometown where he learns the entire heist was a plot by Humpty to lure him home to be captured, as revenge for abandoning him to the authorities when Humpty's youthful heist went bad. Jack, Jill, and Kitty were involved in the con. After pleas from his adoptive mother, Puss turns himself in to the guards while Humpty donates many golden eggs to the town and becomes a hero. While in prison, Puss meets the original Jack from ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" who warns him that the Great Terror is in fact the Goose's mother, and it will stop at nothing to get its child back.

Being caught by a seagull, he struggles for his life and manages to escape, as the seagull clashes in the air with another seagull, also carrying its prey, who turns out to be a female hatchling sea turtle, Shelly. Sammy falls onto an old raft and gets carried into the open ocean, losing Shelly. In the ocean he meets another hatchling, Ray, who tells him the story of a ""turtle paradise"" on an island called ""Lapagos"", and they together start their voyage there. Later, the two get caught by trawls. Sammy is released back into the sea by the fishermen, but loses Ray. Washed onto the shore in California, he is picked up by a hippie woman and lives as a pet in the hippie commune with Vera, another female sea turtle, who is older than Sammy, and Catoff, a cat, who claims to be French. On a Christmas evening the hippies draw a peace sign on his shell to sign him as the peace ambassador. When the hippies see that Sammy and Vera will not mate, they release Vera. The police evicts the hippie commune from the beach, and Sammy decides to return back to the sea. There he meets Vera and a young female sea turtle who is attacked by a shark. Vera and Sammy save the turtle who turns out to be Shelly, his childhood friend. They decide to travel together to find the secret passage and use it to travel to the paradise island. They manage to find the passage  but get separated as they try to pass a lock. Sammy finds an old refrigerator thrown off a ship by the humans and uses it to travel to Antarctic. In the Antarctic waters Sammy meets a fin whale who barely escapes a harpoon from a whaling ship. The harpoon destroys the refrigerator, but Sammy is saved by the anti-whaling protesters and taken back to California where he finds Shelly, Catoff and people from the hippie commune . The ex-hippie recognize the peace sign on Sammy's shell. Shelly is released into the ocean before Sammy, and they are once again separated. As he searches for Shelly, Sammy encounters two sea turtles that urge him to help their friend who got trapped in an intermodal container. Sammy rescues the turtle, who turns out to be his old friend Ray. They swim together to a wrecked Spanish galleon where Ray lives with Rita, his girlfriend. Being told about Shelly, Rita remembers her and advises Sammy to search for her in the galleon. Sammy finds Shelly being courted by another sea turtle. Disappointed and upset, Sammy returns to his friends only to find out that the turtle who courted Shelly is a playboy but has a strong relationship with another female. Together with Ray and Albert, a shark who lost his teeth, they set up a fake shark attack on Shelly to let Sammy save her again and win her heart. Shelly and Sammy then reunite and, along with Ray and Rita, return to the beach they hatched. The closing scene of the movie shows Sammy helping one of his new-hatched grandsons to climb out of the hole."

It is soon revealed that rage is his father's natural state; roughly kicked out of the house to ""go play"", Dylan talks to his next door neighbor, Kylie, of approximately the same age, about what a ""prick"" his father is, and the wise decision of his brother to run away two years prior, to which Kylie observes that at least Shane's father is not in jail like most fathers in the neighborhood, implying that her father is incarcerated. She tells him about the ""Sack Man"", who she's heard kills kids, but Shane says that it is just a story, like ""Santa and God"", used by adults to control kids. Kylie is sent to ""walk"" her infant sibling in a stroller. When she returns, she sees a motorcycle parked in the driveway of her house and her reaction, her hesitation to go into her house, tells us whoever has arrived makes her apprehensive. Inside she is cajoled by her mother to give her uncle a kiss. Her revulsion is evident. When he is leaving and comes to Kylie's bedroom to say goodbye, Kylie hides under her bed, where she has a stash of cash hidden away in a shoe. The view returns to Dylan's house, where his father is screaming at Dylan's mother. When he punches her in the face, Dylan gets involved, throwing his handheld videogame into his father's face which leaves a shard of plastic embedded in his father's forehead. Dylan is chased by his father into an upstairs bathroom. With the door being busted in, Kylie comes to the rescue, maneuvering a ladder near the window from Dylan's yard which allows him to just escape his father's clutches. The pair run from the scene. They are next seen by a narrow river, where a dredger is passing; they climb aboard over the protests of the captain, a friendly sort, who gives them a ride to the end of the line, near Dublin and tells them about Bob Dylan — Dylan's namesake. Kylie and Shane seize on the idea that they will attempt to find Dylan's brother, but all they know of his last whereabouts is that he was living in a squat on Gardiner Street. Reaching there, they start knocking on random doors and asking passersby if they know him. Ultimately following a lead to a Gardiner Street flat, a woman there informs them that he was kicked out for fighting six months earlier. Convinced they will not find his brother, Dylan argues that they have little choice but to go home; Kylie vehemently opposes this and runs off. The two are reunited later when Dylan observes Kylie run into an alley, pursued by a security guard from which she stole food. He joins her in hiding, and they narrowly avoid detection. She adamantly says that she never wants to go home. Kylie reveals that her uncle sexually assaulted her, forcing her to go along with it and gaining her terrified silence by telling her that no one would believe her. Together they find some boxes to sleep on, but a man drives by and tries to convince Kylie to ride with him. She refuses, and the car drives away, only for the man to return and kidnap her. Dylan gives chase, grabbing hold of the bumper of the car. His Heelys, bought earlier from Kylie's savings, allow him to roll along behind the car despite its speed. He screams for help, and the car soon turns into another alley. As the men in the car try to get rid of him, Kylie breaks free of the car, and they both manage to lose their assailants. Realizing that they have feelings for each other, Kylie and Dylan share a passionate kiss. Laughing, they find boxes to sleep on and spend the night on the street. In the morning, Kylie awakens to find a cold hand beside her, sticking out of the box pile. She reacts with horror, stumbling away and waking Dylan. They remove some boxes to reveal a man, recently dead. The next scene is the two of them in a police car, being returned to their houses. The glamour of living on the streets was obviously lost for them. Their families are waiting outside, concerned. Kylie and Dylan share a moment, staring at each other, and Kylie blows him a kiss before their parents bemusedly yank them away."

Ted sets out to find a real tree in order to impress Audrey, who Ted has a crush on. His energetic grandmother suggests he speak with the Once-ler about this, if he wishes to visit him, he must pay fifteen cents, a nail and a shell of great-great-great grandfather snail. When he sets off outside the city discovers that their city has been closed off from the outside world, which is a contaminated and empty wasteland. The Once-ler agrees to tell Ted about the trees if he listens to his story over multiple visits. Ted agrees, even after the mayor of Thneedville, Aloysius O'Hare, who is also the greedy proprietor of a bottled oxygen company, confronts the boy and pressures him to stay in town. Over the course of the film, Ted, with the encouragement of his grandmother, continues to sneak out of O'Hare's sight and learns more of the history of the trees. Over the visits, the Once-ler recounts the story of how he departed his family to make his fortune. In a lush Truffula Tree forest, he met the Lorax. He is a grumpy yet charming orange creature who served as guardian of the land. At first, the Once-ler had a plan to chop down the trees. Eventually, he promised not to chop another tree down. The young businessman's Thneed invention soon became a major success and the Once-ler's family arrived to participate in the business. Keeping his promise at first, the Once-ler continued Thneed production by harvesting the tufts themselves in a sustainable manner. Unfortunately, his greedy and lazy relatives convinced him to resume logging as a more efficient gathering method. Breaking his promise, the Once-ler's deforestation spiraled into a mass overproduction. Flush with wealth, the Once-ler rationalised his short sighted needs into arrogant self-righteousness and the helpless protests of the Lorax could not stop him. The Once-ler polluted the sky, river and landscape, until finally the last Truffula Tree fell outside, and the Once-ler realised what he had done while making the region uninhabitable with his business's pollution. With that, the Once-ler was left ruined and abandoned by his own family and became a recluse with the creation and isolation of Ted's town that came under young Mr. O'Hare's control, giving him the plan to sell fresh air with the absence of trees. Eventually, the Lorax sends the animals away before departing himself into the sky, leaving a stonecut word: ""Unless"". At the end of the story, the Once-ler understands the meaning behind the Lorax's last message, and gives Ted a gift of the last Truffula seed in hopes of planting it to regrow the forest. Ted's desire to impress Audrey is now a personal mission to remind his town of the importance of nature. O'Hare, determined not to have trees undercut his business, takes heavy-handed steps such as covering Audrey's nature paintings, closing off the door that Ted uses to see the Once-ler and forcibly searching Ted's room for the seed. Ted enlists his family and Audrey to help plant the seed, which has begun to germinate after coming into contact with water. O'Hare and his employees pursue the dissidents until they manage to elude him and reach the town center. Unfortunately, their attempt to plant the seed is interrupted by O'Hare who rallies the population to stop them. To convince them otherwise, Ted takes an earthmover and rams down a section of the city wall to reveal the environmental destruction outside. Horrified at the sight and inspired by Ted's conviction, the crowd defies O'Hare with his own henchmen expelling him from the town. The seed is planted, and Audrey kisses Ted on the cheek. Time passes and the land is starting to recover; the trees are regrowing, the animals are returning, and the redeemed Once-ler is happily reunited with the Lorax."

He is using word association and dream interpretation as part of his approach to Freud's radical new science of psychoanalysis, and finds that Fraulein Spielrein's condition was triggered by the humiliation and sexual arousal she felt as a child due to her short-tempered father's habit of spanking her naked. These conflicting feelings were compounded by her instinctive knowledge  that she had done nothing to deserve such a punishment and in fact that she may have been a stand-in for her mother in her father's abuse . Also, her affluent Russian Jewish family afforded her an exceptional education in preparation for university study, although not on the subject of sex, and she was a virgin. Her intelligence and energy were immediately recognized and encouraged by Jung and Eugen Bleuler, the head of the hospital, and since she plans to study medicine they allow her to assist them in their experiments, including measuring the physical reactions of subjects during word association, to provide empirical data as a scientific basis for psychoanalysis and ameliorate the more sensational aspects of Freud's theories, which contend that all mental illness is rooted in childhood sexual experience, be it real or fantasy. She soon learns that much of this new science is founded on the doctors' observations of themselves, each other, and their families, not just their patients. The doctors correspond at length before they meet, and begin sharing their dreams and analysing each other, and Freud adopts Jung as his heir and agent. Jung finds in Sabina a kindred spirit with a unique perspective as her self-awareness sharpens, and their attraction deepens in what was already well known at the time as transference. Jung's resistance to the idea of infidelity, and breaking the taboo of sex with a patient, is undercut by the wild and unrepentant confidences of another brilliant, philandering, unstable psychoanalyst who comes under his care, Otto Gross. He decries monogamy in general and suggests that resistance to transference is symptomatic of the repression of normal, healthy sexual impulses, exhorting Jung to indulge himself with abandon. Jung finally begins their affair, which in the film includes rudimentary bondage and spanking Sabina at times. Things become even more tangled as he becomes her advisor to her dissertation; he publishes not only his studies of her as a patient but eventually her treatise as well. Her original ideas are rooted not only in her insights into her childhood trauma, but the intensity and conflicts in their relationship. Spielrein's thesis suggests that truly heroic, original creations can only emerge from the crucible of great conflict, such as the attraction of opposites and the breaking of taboos, and thus the instinct for creation is inextricably tied to a drive to destruction, and that these feelings and ideas are not restricted to sexual expression despite their roots in the biological drive to reproduce. This includes, finally, his refusal to give her a love child, which is the story behind the reference to Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen operas: they see themselves in the legend of Siegfried, the archetypal Teutonic hero born from a forbidden union. After his attempt to confine their relationship again to doctor and patient, she appeals to Freud for his professional help, and forces Jung to tell Freud the truth about their relationship, reminding him that she could have publicly damaged him but did not want to. Freud uses his knowledge of the relationship to bully Jung, who is planning to publish new theories quite different from Freud's. Jung is working on Psychology of the Unconscious, and his emerging theories of symbolism, archetypes and transformation are heavily influenced by the theme of Sabina's dissertation and their discussion of the Siegfried mythology but he does not cite her in publication, acknowledging her only in private, and Freud does the same, despite the fact that he welcomed her defection from Jung's sphere of influence. Jung throws off his mantle as Freud's ""son and heir"", and their friendship ends. Shortly after Freud dismisses the new ideas expressed by Spielrein in the local meeting of the new psychoanalytic society in Vienna, she marries another Russian physician, and leaves both men behind her. Sabina Spielrein, by then a successful child psychologist and already a widow, was killed with her children by the Nazis during World War II."

Thad attempts to find something meaningful to do as the ""first lady."" Much time is given to his chagrin at being assigned an ultra-feminine bedroom and office within the White House. It is clear that no one, especially Thad McCloud, has given any thought to how a President's husband might fit into the scheme of things. Enter Doris Reid Weaver , Thad's former flame and now an international business woman. She wants Thad back -- and offers him a lucrative position in her company as bait. Leslie has asked him to show visiting dictator Valdez around Washington, with disastrous results. To further complicate things, the first daughter is running around town with a very unsuitable boyfriend and using her position to get out of scrapes with the police. Son Peter has become a bully, using his Secret Service men for protection as he terrorizes everyone in his school -- including the principal. The only solution, in 1964 of course, is for Leslie to discover that she is pregnant, and resign the presidency in order to devote herself full-time to her family."

OSS 117 manages to blow up both of the vehicles and escape by helicopter. He discovers that his unsuccessful assignment was to obtain information from an agent who had been killed providing information about a mysterious criminal organisation called ""The Organisation"". OSS 117's superior, Mr Smith briefs him that The Organisation has informed the U.S. State Department that they have a missile that can strike its target undetected and demand $100 Million Dollars as extortion to not use the weapon. As undeniable proof on their intentions and capabilities, they have destroyed an American military base somewhere in Asia presumably with a nuclear weapon. OSS 117 attends a briefing of American Defence Chiefs who view satellite footage of the destruction of the base that show an American F-107 in the vicinity that may have launched a missile that delivered the device that obliterated the installation. When the military personnel state that no F-107 was in the air or in the area at the time, OSS 117 speculates that it may have been a miniature replica of an F-107 that obliterated the base. Mr Smith tells OSS 117 that their man in Japan Mr Ralston has provided a report of miniature fighters being developed and to keep an eye on an American embassy employee named Eva Wilson . Ralston has vanished but OSS 117 arranges to meet Eva posing as her husband John Wilson who is in Washington. Eva says that she has been blackmailed due to her being drugged and being photographed in bed with a man who was not her husband. Eva provided radio codes of the American base that had been destroyed that allowed The Organisation's secret weapon to destroy the installation. OSS 117 places a covert listening device inside Eva's dress and arranges to monitor her when she meets her blackmail contact. He loses his reception with Eva when unknown to him Eva rips off her listening device. In attempting to follow her, OSS 117 ends up visiting a strip club, has a fight with a large martial arts expert and meets a Japanese bar girl. The latter two are agents of the Japanese Secret Service that team up with OSS 117 on the case. With no progress in the assignment, OSS 117 is told that the ransom will have to be paid, but he continues observing Eva on his own time. The real John Wilson  returns to Eva with OSS 117 following him to reveal that he is a member of The Organisation. Observing that Wilson and Eva going to sea on a small craft, he follows and observes the small craft from an airplane. He sees the craft enter the opening doors of a large cargo ship. OSS 117 parachutes into the water and climbs the side of the ship using a grappling hook mounted on a spear gun. On board he discovers a control room that sends the miniature fighters  to American military bases where due to their size they are undetected by radar. OSS 117 and Eva take on the Organisation...."

JW is originally from the Norrland region in Sweden where his father, who has a slight drinking problem, works in a saw mill, while his mother works in a jobs agency. JW is racked by the disappearance of his sister, Camilla, four years earlier. JW feigns the appearance of a ""Stekare"" , actually leading a double life driving taxi illegally to finance his expensive life on Stureplan. A romance with the upper class girl Sophie leads to him being enticed into the world of organized crime. Abdulkarim, who is running the taxi business, offers JW a job in helping him start his cocaine business. Jorge Salinas Barrio is a Chilean man who went to prison after being caught in the drug business. He has now escaped and is on the run from the police. Jorge knows everything about cocaine. He has a plan: to revenge those who snitched on him, among them Yugoslavian mafia boss Radovan Kranjic, and to make one final cocaine delivery and then leave the country for good. Mrado Slovovic, a hitman who runs errands for the Yugoslavian mafia, is sent by Radovan on a mission to take care of Jorge. At the same time has to struggle with taking care of his eight-year-old daughter, who he is forced to take with him on his job because the mother has a drug addiction. These three characters cross paths through their dreams about quick earnings. Once JW and Abdulkarim have the cocaine sales going, they want to expand. Abdulkarim has heard that Jorge, who has escaped from prison by this time, has learned everything about the cocaine business while in prison. Simultaneously, Jorge has tried to blackmail Radovan, the Yugoslavian mafia boss. Mrado is tasked by Radovan to kill Jorge to prevent him from helping any of Radovan's competitors. Meanwhile, JW is promised 20,000 SEK if he can bring Jorge back to Abdulkarim alive. After noticing Mrado following Jorge, JW tails both of them, losing sight of Jorge when he gets on a bus. JW fortuitously finds them when he notices the car he saw Mrado drive away in standing in a forest clearing. When he enters the forest, he finds Mrado and one of Radovan's henchmen savagely beating Jorge. JW sets off the car alarm of the Serbian attackers to distract them. Meanwhile, Jorge hides from his attackers, who then travel further into the forest to find him. JW approaches a badly wounded Jorge and takes him back to his dormitory. Abdulkarim visits JW and Jorge and helps Jorge recuperate. Though hesitant about keeping Jorge in his dorm room, JW relents when Abdulkarim offers him 1000 SEK for every day Jorge stays. As Jorge recuperates, he learns more about Jaw and the two become friends. At one of the jetsetter parties, JW falls for Sophie , the on and off girlfriend of jet-setter Carl. JW learns that Carl's father's investment bank is in serious financial trouble and Carl may not be able to afford the extravagant ""Stekare"" lifestyle. This becomes important when Abdulkarim asks JW to figure out how they can launder the 20,000,000 SEK profit they will eventually earn. JW proposes that they bustoppers of Carl's father's failing bank, giving it a stimulus that would not only save the business but immediately increase the price of the shares, making it more profitable. JW acts as the front man for Abdulkarim's cocaine syndicate as they attempt to purchase the bank. Though Carl's father has reservations, he eventually relents and accepts the deal. Soon after, JW and the drug syndicate visit Jorge's drug dealer friends in Germany. The drug dealers show how they smuggle drugs by inserting drug capsules under the skin of dogs and then letting the incision heal and the hair grow back which takes two months according to the drug dealers. The drug dealers also place drug capsules in the leaves of young cabbage plants and then let the cabbage grow a full size head around the capsule. Abdulkarim's syndicate ultimately negotiates for a shipment of 40 kilos of pure cocaine. The drug dealers want the money deposited in a Swiss account. JW immediately raises concerns about that plan, arguing that Switzerland is not that secret anymore and recommends an account in Andorra or Liechtenstein instead. This gains the drug dealer's trust and allows the transaction to run smoothly. Later, Jorge advises that JW that he is unlikely to see the money promised by Abdulkarim. JW visits Abdulkarim hideout and while talking with Abdulkarim realizes that what Jorge said was true. Mrado is waiting with his daughter at JW's apartment building and offers JW two million for assistance in raiding Abdulkarim's drug shipment. JW agrees on the understanding that no one will get hurt. The drugs arrive in an eighteen wheeler full of cabbages. Jorge and Abdulkarim's men start repackaging the drugs in a warehouse. Meanwhile, JW assists Mrado and one of Mrado's Serbian friends in entering the warehouse. A firefight occurs and one of Abdulkarim's men is seriously wounded immediately. JW is shocked by the turn of events. Jorge realizes that JW has double crossed them. Meanwhile, jet-set Carl's father has phoned the police to report the drug delivery. JW grabs a weapon and holds off the Serbians as the police arrive and a firefight breaks out. JW and Jorge escape to the rooftop and eventually get to a car. Mrado's friend is seriously wounded, but intends to hold off the others so that Mrado can escape. As Mrado runs from an alley, he is hit and seriously injured by the car with Jorge and JW in it. JW, the least injured of the three, is angry with Mrado who had promised that no one would ge hurt. JW shoots Mrado. JW then fires shots at the policemen closing in, thereby allowing Jorge to escape in the car. JW then surrenders to the police. Mrado is taken away by ambulance and calls his daughter on the way to the hospital. Jorge drives off into a forest and is last seen running through a field similar to the field that he ran through after escaping from prison.

He is visited by Sophie who still cares deeply for JW, but she is leaving Sweden to stay at her parent's house in France. She asks JW if he cares for her. She appears to be willing to wait for JW to finish his prison sentence. JW appears to care for Sophie, but says nothing. As Sophie leaves, she relays a message from Jorge who says that Paola had a baby girl. JW says that if Jorge calls again, tell him that ""The Mathematician says Hello."""

The man's hands are badly burned and cut. The doctor tells the nurse to give the man oxygen. A sequence begins where the man walks along a street in delirium. An old classmate, Jiří Tomeš, greets him and we learn that the man's name is Prokop. He speaks incoherently about an explosion and something he calls krakatit. Jiří brings him home and puts him in bed. In a dream, a university professor asks Prokop about krakatit. He answers that it is a powerful explosive, named after the volcano Krakatoa, and explains its formula. As the dream ends we see that Jiří has written the formula down. Prokop wakes up alone in Jiří's apartment. He finds a note which says that Jiří has gone to his father. Prokop opens the door when a veiled woman rings the bell. She begs Prokop to deliver a letter to Jiří. Prokop, still not recovered, decides to visit Jiří's father, a countryside doctor. An old, horse-powered mail carrier gives Prokop lift. Upon arriving he learns that Jiří has not visited his father in a long time. Prokop collapses. Tended by the doctor and his daughter Anči, Prokop slowly recovers, but cannot recall what has happened. One day he reads in a newspaper about krakatit, which is being promoted by someone named Carson, and Prokop suddenly remembers the explosion in his laboratory. He rushes to the laboratory where he meets Carson, a representative from Balttin Works, a foreign weapon manufacturer. Carson explains that Jiří had sold them Prokop's stock of krakatit and the formula, and that their experiments with krakatit have shown that it is a highly deadly explosive which can be detonated with high-frequency radio signals. However while they have the formula, they have failed to figure out the production procedure, and offer Prokop to work for them. Prokop declines but is brought to the Balttin palace by force. At the palace Prokop begins a romance with a princess. Meanwhile, he realizes he actually is in love with the veiled woman from Jiří's apartment. The Balttin executives offers him to marry the princess if he gives them krakatit. In anger, Prokop blows up the laboratory where he has been held captive, and with his coat loaded with explosives he confronts the princess, whose face dissolves. Prokop is helped to escape from the palace by an ambassador named d'Hémon, who brings him to a secret society of former world leaders and weapon dealers, who worship war and hail Prokop as Comrade Krakatit. As tumult breaks out, a can of krakatit, originally from Prokop's old laboratory, is emptied and the members fight to gather some of the powder for themselves. Prokop and d'Hémon leave and briefly run into the veiled woman. D'Hémon brings Prokop to the top of a hill made of magnesite, where Prokop's old laboratory has been relocated and turned into a secret radio station. They enter and d'Hémon makes Prokop push a button. All remaining krakatit, scattered around European capitals, then explode in the far distance. D'Hémon explains that the explosions are certain to trigger a great war which can be controlled from the radio station with krakatit. Prokop becomes furious and screams at d'Hémon, who disappears before his eyes. Prokop finds himself in a desolate, concrete landscape. He comes upon an enclosed factory, where he asks to see Jiří Tomeš. His requests is rejected, but he is allowed to meet a lab assistant, to whom he gives the letter from the veiled woman. Prokop walks away from the factory. After a while he sees it explode in the distance. The old mail carrier appears and gives Prokop a lift. The driver suggest Prokop should invent something that makes people's lives easier instead of killing people. Back at the hospital from the first scene, the doctor says that the patient now is breathing normally and the oxygen mask can be removed.

Donald begins his story that he was a part of The Panet Street Gang that was made up of six Montreal gangsters, and that fours ago, while they were in prison, they planned a bank heist. When the heist went awry, they all voted to give Jimmy the money in $2 million seeing as he had devoted his life to God, on the condition of promising to share it when they all met again. Jimmy hid under the floor while the other five were taken away. When the five were released from prison, they met at a parish chapel near the Franco-Spanish border. Donald explained to the group that he had received a letter from Jimmy that they were to walk 830 kms of the Camino pilgrammage to Santiago to get their share of the money, with a condition, that they needed to prove that they had changed their character as proof of doing the pilgrammage. They learn that they need pilgrim passports to be able to stay at hostels along the way. They tell the Customs women the truth about themselves and they get their passes. Donald Quintal begins a relationship with Maddy , the girlfriend of Charles  the de facto leader of the group. They arrive in a village and are directed by a boy on his bike to a church and find the gravemarker of Jimmy, who had died of his heroin addiction while staying at Carmet's missionary while the others were incarcerated. Cutting back to the conversation between Quintal and Carmet, Quintal is given the money by being given the location of where it is buried. The gang is arrested in Santiago and while the police is going through their bags, looking for the money, it is shown that Maddy has it. The members leave prison and get back to their lives. Maddy distributes the money to each member as she sees fit, leaving Charles a plane ticket to come and find her in Venice.

Now a middle-aged man, he recalls a scene in his thirties. In the memory, Keiko tells him she is sorry. Yoshida then forces sex on her. In another apartment, Shōko, a woman in her early twenties, lies in bed while Tamura prepares to leave on a business trip. Shōko asks Tamura to buy her lipstick, and Tamura warns Shōko to behave herself while he is gone, since their wedding day is approaching. At City Hall Shōko requests a marriage application. A middle-aged man then asks for a registration for divorce. Meeting on the street, Mika apologizes to Shōko for her tardiness, then takes Shōko to a restaurant. The man who asked for divorce papers at City Hall is the owner of the restaurant. When Shōko indicates that she is having second thoughts about her wedding, Mika dismisses it as ""Marriage blues."" At night, in bed in her apartment, Shōko slowly rips the marriage application in half. She rides her bicycle back to the restaurant, which is now closed. Kudō recognizes Shōko from City Hall. They talk about the meaning of marriage, and Shōko seduces Kudō in the kitchen. At her apartment Shōko listens to Tamura's phone message. He is angry because Shōko is not there, and says he will not buy the lipstick. Shōko returns to the restaurant in the morning. Yoshida awakens from a drunken stupor in his apartment then bursts into the restaurant in a rage trying to fight Kudō. Riding Shōko home on her bike, Kudō explains that Keiko, his wife, was originally Yoshida's girlfriend and first true love. At Keiko's home, Kudō criticizes her for buying Minoru, the eldest of their two sons, a bicycle before Kudō had given approval. Keiko says that because Kudō is only at home on weekends she has to make the decisions. Angry, Kudō leaves claiming he has work to do. Kudō calls Shōko, who is packing in her apartment. He insists that Shōko meet him at the restaurant. At first reluctant, when she returns from seeing Kudō, Shōko finds Tamura in her apartment. He angrily demands to know what she has been doing for the past few days. Shōko explains that she has decided not to go through with the marriage. Walking on the street while drinking sake, Yoshida passes out from an attack of abdominal pain. In his hospital room, Yoshida tells Kudō that he has to remain in the hospital for another two or three days. As Kudō is leaving the hospital a doctor stops him to talk about Yoshida's condition. Kudō pays a surprise mid-week visit to Keiko. While cleaning up with tissues after a passionless bout of sex with her, Kudō tells Keiko that Yoshida is sick, and that she should visit him. Tamura awakens with a hangover in bed with Mika. Because he doesn't remember the night before, Mika offers to have sex with him again. Tamura is confused and reluctant, but Mika persists. Meanwhile at the restaurant, Shōko tells Kudō she isn't sure she loves him. While performing fellatio on him she comments that men taste bitter, but sweet. In the hospital, Yoshida is surprised by Keiko's visit. Yoshida advises Keiko not to go through with the divorce because he is alone in the world after his own divorce. He then has another attack. In the waiting room Kudō tells Keiko that Yoshida actually has cancer, but that he has not been told. Back in the hospital room, Keiko tells Yoshida that he is not alone in the world. Kudō overhears as Keiko explains that Minoru, her oldest boy, is actually Yoshida's son. Sitting in the park, Keiko tells Kudō that Yoshida was not bitter or angry after she left him for Kudō. Handing Kudō an application for divorce, she asks if he can still love Minoru. Later on a train with her two boys Keiko tells Minoru that they're going to meet someone who wants to see him. Minoru asks, ""Who? Daddy?"" She answers, ""Well, yes.""{{cite video}}<ref namehttp://www2u.biglobe.ne.jp/~p-g/data/2004/040910/torareta.htm|title2010-07-19|languageP.G. Web Site}}"

Regine Pernoud has called Hildegard “the inspired conscience of the 12th century,” the “Prophetissa Teutonica” and the “Jewel of Bingen.” Pope John Paul II has called her “a light to her people and for her time, she continues to shine even more brightly today.”Review: Hildegard of Bingen: A New Twelfth-Century Woman Philosopher?

Salman Ahmad, lead guitarist, travel throughout the country in search for the answer of one question for the clerics: ""Where in Islam does it say that music is forbidden?"". His journey in search of an answer, taking in affectionate fans and fiery preachers. A public ban on music gradually takes an effect in Pakistan's North West Frontier Province, after a radical alliance of right-wing religious parties gain power in local elections the previous year. Several music and film stores are closed, musicians have been harassed and vigilantes routinely tear down posters and torch tapes, decrying them as ""un-Islamic"". But in the town of Peshawar, near the Afghan border, an encounter with a bus-load of Pashtuns showed Salman Ahmad how the masses are still in thrall to music. Salman Ahmad is mobbed by men who ask for his autograph and then start singing the tune with which his band hit the big time - ""Jazba-e-Junoon"". When Ahmad asks them why they think the provincial government has banned music, he is told ""They want to listen to music themselves, they just don't want us to have it."" At a religious ceremony in Peshawar, all the young mullahs are aware of Ahmad and his famous band. But they are unable to tell him why music has been banned and are distinctly displeased when he sings a few verses from the Holy Quran to the accompaniment of a guitar. As the film proceeds, Ahmad also meet the maverick preacher, Maulana Bijli, a critic of Western powers, weak Muslim governments and pop music. The Maulana is not convinced by Ahmad's argument that music should no more be banned in Pakistan than in 52 other Muslim countries. Ahmad then meets Gulzar Alam, a traditional Pashtun musician who has first-hand experience of the authorities' crackdown on song.

As Ahmad's meeting with Maulana Bijli draws to a close, the firebrand cleric pats him on the hand and expresses the hope that he hasn't caused offence and that the two men will, one day, meet again. And then, with the instruction to ""play this for them in London,"" Maulana Bijli bursts into song - a song of religious devotion, but melodious nonetheless."

Samar gets subjected to sexual abuse by his father and is rescued by his neighbor, a middle aged single woman Meenakshi Amma  who names him Veera, takes him under her wings and protects him. Daunted and chased by the ghosts of his painful past, Veera forcefully has sex with Meenakshi Amma. She, though reluctant at first, indulges in the act. After coming back to her senses the next morning, she refuses Veera's apology and decides to marry her colleague. After the marriage, on the same night, when Meenakshi and her husband are in bed, Veera stabs him brutally and sets him and the room on fire. Accidentally, Meenakshi Amma also gets injured in the fire. After treatment, he brings back the scar-faced, burn inflicted Meenakshi Amma to his bungalow in ECR. After a couple of weeks, Veera meets a girl named Priya  on the net. They meet up and finally fall for each other. He invites her home and they grow intimate, suddenly to be interrupted by a loud scream from Priya, because Meenakshi Amma stabs her brutally, similar to Veera's exploit. She orders him to cut her hair as she wants it. In the following years, Veera kidnaps women, rapes them and finally kills them in cold-blood. As the murders continue, Veera stumbles upon Sukanya , a girl whom he has been in love with since 10th grade. He meets her at a theatre with her boyfriend Arjun  and lies to her that he had gone with another girl and offers her a ride home.

He follows Peniston  into the facility. The head scientist Dr.Bishop  shows them the projects he is working on, including a shark and dolphin hybrid with the ability to adapt to any environment, as well as a human and shark hybrid . It breaks free from its tank and kills Dr. Bishop. Richland orders Peniston to kill it, but Peniston instead traps the Creature in a containment unit and dumps it in the sea. 25 years later... Dr. Chase , a marine biologist, and his assistant, Tall Man , find a pregnant female Great White Shark trapped in Ben Mediera's  nets. Dr. Chase sets it free. Meanwhile, a local fisherman, Puckett , retrieves the containment unit and accidentally releases the creature. Mediera is later eaten by the creature. Dr. Chase & Tall Man meet Dr. Macy , her sea lion named Robin, and Dr. Chase's son, Max , at the airport. As Dr. Chase & Dr. Macy prepare to out on the ocean, Max goes into town. He meets the native kids including Elizabeth , the chief's daughter. The local boys tell him he'll have to take the test of bravery and jump from a tall cliff. Mediera's body is found and police Chief Gibson asks Dr. Chase to inspect the body. Chase says even though there is a great white out there it is not the culprit and tells the chief not to let people go after the innocent shark. Dr. Chase and Dr. Macy leave and prepare to go out and find the real culprit. Tall Man arrives, escorted by his girlfriend, Tauna . Peniston, who has gone crazy and is called 'Werewolf' by the locals, sees the empty containment unit after Puckett brings it ashore. He realizes Mediera was not killed by a shark. Dr. Chase and Dr. Macy are unable to find the Creature and return to Dr. Chase's headquarters . Dr. Macy reveals Dr. Chase studies why sharks do not get cancer, which his best friend died from. Meanwhile the kids take turns jumping of the cliff, unaware the creature is lurking right below them. Max and another boy jump in. The creature devours the other boy, but Max escapes. When the boy's body is found, the chief is furious and, no longer listening to Dr. Chase, orders all the fisherman to hunt for the great white. Dr.Chase, Dr. Macy, Max and Tall Man search for the Creature again; this time with success. The creature attacks their boat, but they escape. By this time, Puckett has killed the great white and the islanders celebrate, believing the danger is past. Dr. Chase tells the chief that they are not safe and that he has seen the Creature. However, the chief refuses to believe him. They do research at Dr. Chase's headquarters, and are soon put into contact with Richland. Richland tells Dr. Chase not to do anything until he arrives. Dr. Chase argues that more people could die if they do not take action but Richland does not care. Richland and a troop of NAVY SEALs board a helicopter and set off for the island. Dr. Chase ignores Richland's warning and goes back out into his boat. Peniston uses a horn to attract the creature, which is attracted to noise. The creature attacks him, but Dr. Chase and friends save him. They bring him back to their headquarters. The next day Dr. Chase discovers clawmarks on his boat . Later, Peniston shows them a secret tunnel leading to the actual research facility. Meanwhile, Richland and the SEALs approach the island in their helicopter. Dr. Chase and Dr. Macy go down the tunnel and discover it to be half flooded, most likely connected to the ocean. They also discover equipment and notes. They find some of Puckett's traps and wonder how they got there. By the time they realize who brought them, it is too late: the creature ambushes them. They run and the creature gives pursuit, but is only able to go so far until it can't catch up because its arms and legs are short and weak out of water. It stops and evolves its arms and legs until they are like that of a human. The creature resumes chase. The doctor and her friends manage to escape and reseal the tunnel blocking the creature. They leave the research facility by boat. The creature attacks them when they reach the dock. It is about to kill Max, but then lets him live. Dr. Macy goes to the town doctor and says that she has claw wounds. Dr. Chase discusses the encounter with Chief Gibson, but he still refuses to believe. They decide to send Max back to the States. Elizabeth stops him and says that she can't find her cousin. Elizabeth claims the only place she could be is at the old rum factory . They then leave to find it. Puckett goes diving and is killed by the creature. Dr. Chase, Dr. Macy, and Peniston return to headquarters only to be ambushed by Richland and his thugs. He sends a few of his cronies to explore the tunnels. Meanwhile, Max & Elizabeth find the old rum factory out in the swamp. They enter, but don't find her cousin, only Tauna. They head outside to look in the swamp when suddenly a man's head floats to the surface. Max recognizes it as Puckett's. They run away, but the creature jumps out of a tree and chases them. Dr. Chase examines the stuff in the tunnel but Richland destroys it and threatens Chase. The kids make it to Tauna's house and hide and contact Dr. Chase. Before he can make it back, the creature attacks the house. When he arrives, he finds the house in ruins and believes the children are dead, but they come out of their hiding places. Chief Gibons soon arrives and Elizabeth tells him that the creature exists. He finally accepts the beast's existence. The Chief and Richland lead a hunt for the creature in the swamp. Dr. Chase goes with them and exposes Richland as one of the people present at the original event. He says how Richland's cover-up put people at risk. Richland threatens to kill him, but the Chief stops him. The creature attacks and kills Richland's men. The Chief falls into the water. But instead of saving him, Richland just watches hoping the creature will attack the Chief so he can kill it and finally settle his the score. Dr. Chase rescues the Chief. The creature obliterates the bridge where Richland is standing. He falls into the water where the creature eats him. Dr. Chase and the Chief escape and make it back to town the next day. There the chief is reunited with Elizabeth and finally understands and accepts Dr. Chase as a good man. Dr. Chase, Tall Man, Max, and Dr. Macy return to headquarters where Peniston is waiting. Dr. Macy realizes he was there. She angrily asks him why he did not kill the creature. Peniston replies that it was because they used his blood to help create it and that the creature is a part of him. They use Robin with a camera attached to her back to locate the creature. It locates the beast's lair, but before they can retrieve her, the creature attacks and the camera goes blank. Tall Man & Peniston enter the tunnel shortly after. Tall Man shoots at the creature but Peniston interferes. The creature injures Tall Man. Dr. Chase arrives and helps Tall Man escape, but are pursued by the creature. The creature quickly gains the upper hand and almost kills Chase. Max uses Peniston's sound device to destract the creature. It attacks him, but he uses a zipline to escape. Peniston takes the sound device and lures the creature into the pressure chamber. Dr. Chase locks them in and activates it, building greater and greater pressure. The creature kills Peniston. Chase allows the pressure to build up very high then smashes the window causing all the air to come out. This causes explosive decompression and the creature explodes, finally killing it. Later, the survivors walk into the sun set ready to board the boat, presumably to go back to town and never return to the island.

The head scientist Dr.Bishop  shows them the projects he is working on, including a shark and dolphin hybrid with the ability to adapt to any environment, as well as a human and shark hybrid . It breaks free from its tank and kills Dr. Bishop. Richland orders Peniston to kill it, but Peniston instead traps the Creature in a containment unit and dumps it in the sea. 25 years later... Dr. Chase , a marine biologist, and his assistant, Tall Man , find a pregnant female Great White Shark trapped in Ben Mediera's  nets. Dr. Chase sets it free. Meanwhile, a local fisherman, Puckett , retrieves the containment unit and accidentally releases the creature. Mediera is later eaten by the creature. Dr. Chase & Tall Man meet Dr. Macy , her sea lion named Robin, and Dr. Chase's son, Max , at the airport. As Dr. Chase & Dr. Macy prepare to out on the ocean, Max goes into town. He meets the native kids including Elizabeth , the chief's daughter. The local boys tell him he'll have to take the test of bravery and jump from a tall cliff. Mediera's body is found and police Chief Gibson asks Dr. Chase to inspect the body. Chase says even though there is a great white out there it is not the culprit and tells the chief not to let people go after the innocent shark. Dr. Chase and Dr. Macy leave and prepare to go out and find the real culprit. Tall Man arrives, escorted by his girlfriend, Tauna . Peniston, who has gone crazy and is called 'Werewolf' by the locals, sees the empty containment unit after Puckett brings it ashore. He realizes Mediera was not killed by a shark. Dr. Chase and Dr. Macy are unable to find the Creature and return to Dr. Chase's headquarters . Dr. Macy reveals Dr. Chase studies why sharks do not get cancer, which his best friend died from. Meanwhile the kids take turns jumping of the cliff, unaware the creature is lurking right below them. Max and another boy jump in. The creature devours the other boy, but Max escapes. When the boy's body is found, the chief is furious and, no longer listening to Dr. Chase, orders all the fisherman to hunt for the great white. Dr.Chase, Dr. Macy, Max and Tall Man search for the Creature again; this time with success. The creature attacks their boat, but they escape. By this time, Puckett has killed the great white and the islanders celebrate, believing the danger is past. Dr. Chase tells the chief that they are not safe and that he has seen the Creature. However, the chief refuses to believe him. They do research at Dr. Chase's headquarters, and are soon put into contact with Richland. Richland tells Dr. Chase not to do anything until he arrives. Dr. Chase argues that more people could die if they do not take action but Richland does not care. Richland and a troop of NAVY SEALs board a helicopter and set off for the island. Dr. Chase ignores Richland's warning and goes back out into his boat. Peniston uses a horn to attract the creature, which is attracted to noise. The creature attacks him, but Dr. Chase and friends save him. They bring him back to their headquarters. The next day Dr. Chase discovers clawmarks on his boat . Later, Peniston shows them a secret tunnel leading to the actual research facility. Meanwhile, Richland and the SEALs approach the island in their helicopter. Dr. Chase and Dr. Macy go down the tunnel and discover it to be half flooded, most likely connected to the ocean. They also discover equipment and notes. They find some of Puckett's traps and wonder how they got there. By the time they realize who brought them, it is too late: the creature ambushes them. They run and the creature gives pursuit, but is only able to go so far until it can't catch up because its arms and legs are short and weak out of water. It stops and evolves its arms and legs until they are like that of a human. The creature resumes chase. The doctor and her friends manage to escape and reseal the tunnel blocking the creature. They leave the research facility by boat. The creature attacks them when they reach the dock. It is about to kill Max, but then lets him live. Dr. Macy goes to the town doctor and says that she has claw wounds. Dr. Chase discusses the encounter with Chief Gibson, but he still refuses to believe. They decide to send Max back to the States. Elizabeth stops him and says that she can't find her cousin. Elizabeth claims the only place she could be is at the old rum factory . They then leave to find it. Puckett goes diving and is killed by the creature. Dr. Chase, Dr. Macy, and Peniston return to headquarters only to be ambushed by Richland and his thugs. He sends a few of his cronies to explore the tunnels. Meanwhile, Max & Elizabeth find the old rum factory out in the swamp. They enter, but don't find her cousin, only Tauna. They head outside to look in the swamp when suddenly a man's head floats to the surface. Max recognizes it as Puckett's. They run away, but the creature jumps out of a tree and chases them. Dr. Chase examines the stuff in the tunnel but Richland destroys it and threatens Chase. The kids make it to Tauna's house and hide and contact Dr. Chase. Before he can make it back, the creature attacks the house. When he arrives, he finds the house in ruins and believes the children are dead, but they come out of their hiding places. Chief Gibons soon arrives and Elizabeth tells him that the creature exists. He finally accepts the beast's existence. The Chief and Richland lead a hunt for the creature in the swamp. Dr. Chase goes with them and exposes Richland as one of the people present at the original event. He says how Richland's cover-up put people at risk. Richland threatens to kill him, but the Chief stops him. The creature attacks and kills Richland's men. The Chief falls into the water. But instead of saving him, Richland just watches hoping the creature will attack the Chief so he can kill it and finally settle his the score. Dr. Chase rescues the Chief. The creature obliterates the bridge where Richland is standing. He falls into the water where the creature eats him. Dr. Chase and the Chief escape and make it back to town the next day. There the chief is reunited with Elizabeth and finally understands and accepts Dr. Chase as a good man. Dr. Chase, Tall Man, Max, and Dr. Macy return to headquarters where Peniston is waiting. Dr. Macy realizes he was there. She angrily asks him why he did not kill the creature. Peniston replies that it was because they used his blood to help create it and that the creature is a part of him. They use Robin with a camera attached to her back to locate the creature. It locates the beast's lair, but before they can retrieve her, the creature attacks and the camera goes blank. Tall Man & Peniston enter the tunnel shortly after. Tall Man shoots at the creature but Peniston interferes. The creature injures Tall Man. Dr. Chase arrives and helps Tall Man escape, but are pursued by the creature. The creature quickly gains the upper hand and almost kills Chase. Max uses Peniston's sound device to destract the creature. It attacks him, but he uses a zipline to escape. Peniston takes the sound device and lures the creature into the pressure chamber. Dr. Chase locks them in and activates it, building greater and greater pressure. The creature kills Peniston. Chase allows the pressure to build up very high then smashes the window causing all the air to come out. This causes explosive decompression and the creature explodes, finally killing it. Later, the survivors walk into the sun set ready to board the boat, presumably to go back to town and never return to the island.

He was initially shunned by both Hindus and Muslims, especially by Hindu Bal Bhate. Sai was a Muslim and Bal Bhate forbade him to enter any Temple. Rohila, a Muslim, who thought Sai was desecrating the local Masjid by performing Hindu prayers and incantations and attempted to kill Sai. Then he saw both the Allah and Bhagwan in Sai and became a devotee. When Sai was ready to give up his body and resurrect himself after 3 days, just like Lord Jesus, a disbelieving Bal had wanted Sai's body to be cremated within 24 hours - only to find out that Sai had indeed risen, and also became his devotee. Bhagoti, a leper, who was cured by Sai became his follower. Though Sai had no relations, he did call Tatya's mother his sister; Tatya his maternal nephew; a devotee named Laxmi as his daughter, and an elderly woman as his mother. Sai displayed his true form and opulence to another devotee, Nana Chandorkar. Sai lived in a rebuilt Masjid and urged his devotees to pray God, as the Creator and to love and respect all living beings. He begged for alms daily so that he could collect sins and wash them away. He always uttered 'Allah Bhala Kare' and 'Bhagwan Bhala Kare' to both Muslims and Hindus alike. He appeared in a multitude forms to his deities  to cater to the various tastes of devotees.

These include a priest  and a Belgian émigrée , the latter having suffered personal tragedy during the occupation of Belgium. Her motives are initially questioned before she is finally given the green light. On completion of their training the operatives are parachuted into Belgium, briefed to destroy a Nazi records office in Brussels and to spring a prominent S.O.E. agent from custody. As the group arrive in Belgium, the S.O.E. discover that one of their number is a double-agent; however it is too late to raise the alert. With the first part of their mission completed to plan, the operatives are hiding out with the Belgian resistance when the S.O.E. succeed in getting a message through, alerting one of them to the presence of a traitor among their ranks. The individual is executed following the discovery of unambiguous evidence of duplicity. The second part of the mission then goes ahead, with the captured S.O.E. operative being successfully released after a road and railway chase sequence.

Susan convinces her to travel from Venice to Paris by train, instead of by plane. They board the Orient Express, where they hope to find romance. Instead, the atmosphere reminds Lily of a trip on the same train 10 years earlier, when she was a 19-year-old student traveling through Europe with her friend Stacey . On that trip, she met Alex Woodward ([[Stuart Wilson , an aristocratic Englishman whom she courted, and then never heard from again. On the present day trip, Lily unexpectedly hears from Alex again, who admits that the rendezvous is no coincidence. Enraged over the past, she refuses to talk to him. Through flashbacks, their past story is slowly revealed. They fell in love on a train to Nice, and agreed to travel together. Alex wanted to marry her, but his friend Sandy  assured him his father Theodore  would never approve. While having dinner one evening, Alex was excused by one of his father's friends, and never returned. In the present, Alex convinces Lily to have dinner with him, but past conflicts causes her to leave prematurely. She later returns, deciding to give him another chance. They find out they were both married for five years, but only Lily's marriage produced a child. Alex reveals that his father pressured him into another marriage, and that he never regretted something more than leaving her. The conversation soon escalates in a passionate affair, but the next morning she makes clear that she has no desire of rekindling with him. They go into different routes, until Alex decides to follow her to Paris. Meanwhile, Lily regrets her decision of sending Alex away. She fears she will never love someone again, and thinks the solution is marrying a man she is meeting in London. One day, however, Alex finds her in a Parisian restaurant and takes her into his arms. In a sub-plot, Susan falls in love with Flavio, one of the Orient Express staff members. They start a romance, but his work forces them to part their ways.

As a celebratory routine, the boys purchase a bong and use that bong only when one of the four have sex for the first time. The boys are beginning to lose their virginity and Matt is the last one. Matt, as it is learned throughout the film, is the adopted brother of Zack after Matt's mother died from cancer when he was 9. Matt's father had drug issues and while still involved in his life, does not play a major role in it. Matt has been with his girlfriend Nicole for almost two years and the two decide to lose their virginity together on their second anniversary. Zack decides to videotape the entire process and it is portrayed as a documentary-type film. As Matt prepares for the big night, he discovers that Nicole has cheated on him with a college fraternity member, Harry. Zack goes to find Harry to confirm this but he would not confirm nor deny this. Matt and the guys assume she did in fact have sex with Harry and the plan for the big night is soon altered. Zack decides the best thing for Matt to do is still have sex with Nicole but break up with her immediately afterwards. He feels this would be great for the movie he is making. Matt and his friends set up a date for Matt at a hotel, but when Nicole realizes they are being filmed and recorded from the adjoining room, she becomes angry at Matt, and admits she did not go very far sexually with Harry. She claims he had only sucked on her breasts. Nicole's father then comes and takes Nicole away from Matt and then pushes Matt into a bush after he breaks up with her. The entire segment on the failed date soon becomes a YouTube classic. A young woman, Becca, sees the video and claims that she feels bad for Matt. She leaves a video response letting him know she is experienced and would love to be his first. Becca's first requirement for the date is that Matt buys a very expensive suit. Matt is then reminded by Zack that his mother left him a large amount of money and convinces Matt to withdraw it for the suit. Matt then learns that his father withdrew the money when he was younger and the funds are not available. Angered by this, Matt decides to confront his father about it. After doing so, he learns his father has no desire to pay him back and claims the money was used for drugs. The boys and Krysta, Zack and Matt's adopted other adopted sibling, get drunk and camp. During this time Krysta unsuccessfully tries to have sex with Matt. When the boys return home, they come up with a plot to steal the suit, which is successful. Matt finally meets Becca and she tells him that she has a son. They then plan the date and as she is leaving, hands Matt a note that lets him know he needs to be shaven in all parts of his body including his pubic region. Preparing for the date, Zack ends up shaving Matt's pubic region for him. When Matt arrives at Becca's residence, he is told by Becca the cameras cannot stay and film, and that he must practice sex on a blow-up doll, which has an inflatable penis as well. Instructed by Becca, Matt uses the doll's penis in place of the vagina. Becca then leaves for nearly 3 hours before Matt leaves. The film then shows Becca on a video blog admitting her name is not Becca and that she is actually a graduate student studying male behavior and notes that he waited over twice as long as any other male had in the past. She also admits that her child was not hers, but someone else that she used for her studies. The video of him with the blow up doll becomes a huge YouTube success and shamed and embarrassed, Matt stays in his room for two weeks. In an effort to get Matt out his funk, the boys come up with a plan for Matt to have sex with his favorite porn star, Sunny Leone. They contact her and she agrees as long as the funds are paid. The boys and others raise the funds and then come up with a plan that Jacob is going into the military to be able to get Matt out of the house. They go to a strip club and meet Sunny and then go out to her bus so Matt may have sex with her. In the bus, Sunny lets Matt know that she has changed her mind and says that he should find someone he loves to have sex with. He then requests to spend five minutes alone with her, which is granted. After a few minutes, Matt emerges from her bedroom and we see Sunny putting her shirt back on. He sucked on her breasts to even out what Nicole did to him. He then finds Nicole at a party, explains what he did, and the two have sex. The film ends with the boys celebrating Matt losing his virginity.

Preparing for the date, Zack ends up shaving Matt's pubic region for him. When Matt arrives at Becca's residence, he is told by Becca the cameras cannot stay and film, and that he must practice sex on a blow-up doll, which has an inflatable penis as well. Instructed by Becca, Matt uses the doll's penis in place of the vagina. Becca then leaves for nearly 3 hours before Matt leaves. The film then shows Becca on a video blog admitting her name is not Becca and that she is actually a graduate student studying male behavior and notes that he waited over twice as long as any other male had in the past. She also admits that her child was not hers, but someone else that she used for her studies. The video of him with the blow up doll becomes a huge YouTube success and shamed and embarrassed, Matt stays in his room for two weeks.

The boys and others raise the funds and then come up with a plan that Jacob is going into the military to be able to get Matt out of the house. They go to a strip club and meet Sunny and then go out to her bus so Matt may have sex with her. In the bus, Sunny lets Matt know that she has changed her mind and says that he should find someone he loves to have sex with. He then requests to spend five minutes alone with her, which is granted. After a few minutes, Matt emerges from her bedroom and we see Sunny putting her shirt back on. He sucked on her breasts to even out what Nicole did to him. He then finds Nicole at a party, explains what he did, and the two have sex. The film ends with the boys celebrating Matt losing his virginity.

She gives him advice on how to run faster, and although he is initially reluctant to be taught a man's sport from a girl, he soon notices how gifted she is and is happy to listen to her.

However, one day Timmy winds up reuniting with a girl from his childhood named Tootie who once possessed an infatuation on him and sees that she has grown into a beautiful activist. Soon, Timmy starts to fall in love with Tootie and begins to date her, much to the chagrin of his fairy godparents, Cosmo and Wanda, who continuously scheme to repel Tootie.

Paul wins the case, but only by seducing the judge, who happens to be a woman. Shortly after, Boullard sets out to New York, where he plans on reuniting with his daughter Lauren , whom he has not seen for over 25 years, since his American wife divorced him for flirting with another woman. On the plane, he meets Paul, to whom he complains about having lost because of his charm, a French quality. Paul apologizes for having hurt his French pride and offers a favor in return. In New York, Boullard is shocked to find out that Lauren has become an intimidating career woman, working as a psychologist.

Instead of revealing his identity, he decides to help her from a distance. He contacts Paul to have an affair with her, to open up her mind to passion, rather than her career. Paul would be the perfect man for the deed: he is the ultimate womanizer. One woman comes in each day to cook for him, the other is happy to wash his clothes. Initially, Paul is reluctant to help out Boullard, suspecting that Lauren is less than attractive, but because he notices that Boullard is suspicious of why he really won the case, he decides to help him out. To grow closer to her, he poses as her patient, telling her that he is irresistible to women and that he is too afraid to turn down a woman, because it led to suicide in the past.

Legally the French may not fish within three miles of the British coast, and vice versa, and alleged breaches of this rule are the cause of frequent spats between hot-headed Cornish harbour-master Nat Pomeroy  and Lanec Florrie , an equally redoubtable widow from the Breton port. Beneath all the bluster and posturing however, there is a mutual understanding and respect between the two communities. Widower Nat's daughter Sue  has been friends since childhood with local boy Bob Tremayne , and their eventual marriage has been taken as a given. During a visit by the Cornish contingent to Brittany a wrestling match is arranged between Bob and Lanec's son Yan , during which Yan breaks a bone, to the concern of Sue. Yan is attracted to Sue and begins actively to woo her, with great success. Sue is torn between her own attraction to Yan and her unspoken commitment to Bob, a situation which leads to increased friction between the two communities. However when war-related danger ensues, both sides realise that their unity in common cause against the mutual enemy is more important than petty squabbles. Bob is called up to serve in the British navy, and in a showdown conversation with Yan before he leaves, the two agree that Sue must be allowed to follow her own heart.

His personal goal to become the greatest swordsman in the entire world is accomplished when he kills the former greatest swordsman and leader of the enemy clan. Both clans swore to fight until every single member of the opposing clan was dead. Yang has killed every member, except a baby girl he comes upon, spares and decides to watch over. This act makes Yang a sworn enemy of his own clan, and is not safe in his homeland. Yang arrives in Lode, a small, dusty, town, where the main attraction used to be a carnival. There he seeks out a fellow rogue warrior friend known to the townsfolk as Smiley. Yang discovers Smiley died 3 years ago, but ran the town's laundry shop. Among the townspeople Yang meets, he is introduced to the gang of friendly carnies led by dwarf Eight-Ball , Ron , the vagrant drunk and Lynne , a spunky young woman who was friends with Smiley. Lynne gives Yang the nickname Skinny and agrees to teach him how to do the laundry. Yang begins to enjoy his life in the town, learning to enjoy pleasures he never knew as a warrior. He becomes friendly with the people, a hard worker, and able gardener, while the baby dubbed April , is adored by all. He even finds an interest in opera, after Lynne shows him on a gramophone. Lynne reveals to Yang that Smiley taught her both a little bit of the sword and the Sad Flute clan. She wants Yang to teach her more, and asks about the Sad Flutes' name. He explains that it describes the sound of blood coming from your victim's slit throat, but he is reluctant to show any of his warrior skill. Back in the East, Yang's former clan is shown to be looking for him. His former master Saddest Flute  and his ninja army take the same boat to America, killing the entire crew in the process. Saddest Flute states that to find Yang in such a large country, they would wait and listen. Yang one day sees Lynne place flowers on a grave, and asks Eight-Ball what happened. He explains in a flashback, that years ago, when Lynne was an adolescent girl, the town came under siege by a corrupt Colonel . His preference to rape women with healthy teeth prompts him to choose Lynne as his victim while her father is held to the ground, and mother and baby brother forced to stand by. When Lynne is brought to the Colonel in a kitchen, she manages to evade him by throwing a pan of potatoes frying in grease on his face. She runs outside, and the Colonel shoots her in the back. Her father struggles free and is shot dead by the Colonel, while her mother holding her brother runs over and both are also killed. When the townsfolk buried her family, they found Lynne still breathing. Since then, Lynne has made revenge on the Colonel a priority, aching to learn to fight and kill, and practices throwing knives, at which she her aim is lacking. Yang surprises Lynne by showing her that her knife throwing was prohibited by her sight, not her arm, and gives her a successful lesson by blindfolding her. Lynne is clearly fond of Yang, and gives him a charm on a necklace that belonged to her mother, as a present. Yang shows her his jedok geom , but Lynne notes it is welded to its scabbard. Yang explains it is so his past cannot hear the sound of the lives he has taken, and if his past finds him, there will be no more music. In a flashback, it is shown as a young boy, Yang was given a present of a small puppy from his master, and was being trained to become the strongest. The Colonel returns to the town to terrorize the people. He now wears a frightening face prosthetic to hide the grotesque scar from the hot grease. The colonel tortures a clown by having his men shoot at a bucket of water on the Clown's head, and is about to have them shoot at a glass of whiskey when Ron the drunk takes the shot glass and drinks it. Ron is dragged through the town by a whip around his neck pulled by horse. The Colonel then inspects a lineup of women for their teeth, and chooses a Hispanic woman whose husband begs for mercy. The Colonel releases the woman to her husband to shoot them simultaneously. Eight-Ball and the other carnies tie Lynne up in a cellar for her own good as well as the people. Yang removes her blades, agreeing with the carnies. Lynne manages to free herself with a concealed knife in her boot. The Colonel has the Hispanic woman's daughters cleaned to be raped, but Lynne, disguised as a prostitute offers herself instead. She fools the Colonel, thinking she will be able to kill him when he reveals he recognized her after smelling her neck. The Colonel's men rush in to hold Lynne down to the bed. Back in the laundry, the carnies run in looking for Lynne, and Yang realizes where she is. He grabs an iron and shatters the seal on his sword to free it. Far away, Saddest Flute jerks up from meditation, sensing the seal break, and is aware of Yang's location. Just as she is about to be raped, Yang bursts in through the window, expertly and easily slaying everyone in the room but Lynne and the Colonel. As Yang turns to kill him, Lynne intercedes that she will do it, but the Colonel grabs her and leaps out the other window, using her to break his fall. The Colonel runs down an alley to escape. Lynne sees him fleeing on a horse and shuts her eyes to deliver an expert knife throw to the back of his head. The townsfolk pull off the prosthetic to reveal a lackey of the Colonel, now especially scared that he will return with an army of outlaws to kill them all. Yang is about to leave town before the Sad Flutes come for him, but the townsfolk implore him to stay and help. The people are worried they don't have the means to defend their town, but Eight-Ball has Ron's secret stash of guns and explosives unburied. Ron is shown to be an expert marksman, shooting a bowling pin down amidst his best liquor from hundreds of feet away. Yang asks Ron while preparing why Ron stopped shooting. Ron explains that he was once an outlaw, using his great skill to rob banks, and trains. His criminal career ended when the woman he loved was shot during a gunfight, and he vowed to never pick up a gun again, until that day. Ron advises for men like him and Yang, the best thing they could do for the ones they loved was stay as far away from them as possible, that they are like flowers while he and Yang are sand. The day before battle, Lynne comes to Yang and asks to leave with him after the fight, and to think on it. Later that night, Yang comes to Lynne's house. He gives her his own twin short swords, explaining these were to kill. Yang tells her to come close. The day comes and the Colonel arrives with scores of outlaws to charge the town. Yang stands across his flower garden, waiting. As the men approach, they are met with explosions. From miles away in the top ferris wheel cab, Ron is sniping sticks of dynamite hidden in the garden as riders come. In the ensuing dust and chaos, Yang rapidly and stealthily disposes of the men. The outlaws are lured to the ferris wheel, where Yang and the carnies ambush them. Ron slides to safety on a cable, and the ferris wheel is blown up, killing many of the Colonel's men. Thinking it safe, the carnies come out from cover, only to be attacked by the numerous remaining outlaws. The Colonel's men chase the carnies to the center of town, where the Sad Flutes suddenly assemble. Saddest Flute instructs them 'kill.' Yang looks to Lynne holding April and tells her to run. The carnies manage to get away before the bloodshed between the outlaw cowboys and clan warriors starts. Yang runs after Lynne and must cut down several warriors before following her to the laundry shop. Meanwhile, the cowboys in town manage to shoot down some clan warriors, but are engaged in lethal battle. In the laundry, Lynne hands April to Eight-Ball so she can help Yang. While he is killing a warrior, she saves him from another sneaking in. After they are safe for the moment, they hear shots, and run to Eight-Ball, where he is dying and says he couldn't protect April. He dies and the Colonel is seen carrying her in a building, yelling at his men to make sure no one got in. The Sad Flutes pursue hotly, and are mostly fended off with a small machine gun, but the outlaws are unable to stop Yang, as he brutally slices through them all. He comes in the room to find the Colonel holding a gun to April's head, and leaps up to cut the barrel and bullet in half mid-firing. Catching April from falling, Yang steps aside to let Lynne fight the Colonel. After a tense battle, Lynne manages to finally drive a sword into the Colonel's back. Yang and Lynne exit the room to find Saddest Flute sitting across the carnage at the end of the hall. He tells Yang that April is the enemy, and asks if he would ever tell April that Yang killed her parents, her whole clan, and observes that Yang ran away from his old life of killing to kill more. He says Yang does not belong there. Yangs claims he does, or did, and will not kill April. Yang and Saddest flute go to the desert in the sunset, and duel to the death. During, flashbacks show Saddest Flute training Yang as an adult in pouring rain, drilling him through adolescence in the snow, and forcing child Yang to kill the puppy he was given, declaring Yang's biggest enemy would be his heart, and as an assassin, he must kill what he loves. In the present, Yang wins the duel, cutting Saddest Flute's throat. Lynne tells Yang she knows she won't be coming with him, and tries to hand him April, but he refuses. He makes the baby laugh once more, and gives Lynne a caring look. Yang turns to the sunset, and Ron tells him to 'keep walking, sandman.' Ron narrates that the warrior never stopped walking, to put as much space between him and the little lady he loved as possible, showing April then Lynne. The scene then shifts to the a snowy, glacial environment. Opera plays from a small fish shack where a hooded man in a parka sits. Another approaches and asks how much for a fish. The sitting man nimbly kills the other, knives falling out of his hands as he collapses. Yang stands up and goes to his shack, where he takes the pendant he had been given by Lynne, his sword disguised as a snowman's broom, and April's pacifier, and sets the hut on fire. Walking out to the snow, a slew of clan warriors leap out of the snow, and Yang unsheathes his sword as the scene fades.

A little girl picks up a teddy bear found lying near Sayaka's body and, as she looks up at a block of apartments, she says: ""There goes another one."" At Sayaka's funeral, her older sister Mariko has been trying to cheer up Sayaka's grieving friends when she soon notices the ghostly form of Sayaka, who whispers: ""Mom pushed me."" Their mother, deeply devastated by Sayaka’s death, seems to be falling into a world of insanity, which worries and concerns Mariko, who decides to protect her mother by taking on the responsibility of sorting out Sayaka’s estate. As Mariko's about to enter Sayaka’s apartment, a little girl appears from the next door and asks her if she’s afraid of #1303. Mariko, puzzled, says she isn’t. The girl nods and casually informs her that ""all women who lived there had died, you know."" While Mariko clears out the apartment, she repeatedly catches the sight of Sayaka and hears her ghostly voice on phone. Each time Mariko tries to talk to her, Sayaka either stares back or whispers a couple of words before vanishing. During the clear out, Mariko comes across an earring that looked as if it’d been ripped out of someone's earlobe. Mariko wonders if this might be a clue. After turning over Sayaka’s apartment to the landlord, Mariko meets a police detective, Sakurai, who reveals that he’s been investigating a series of suicides at #1303 and he doesn’t believe it’s a coincidence. Mariko gives him the blood-streaked earring as she believes it belongs to a previous tenant. Mariko soon comes across a book about the first two tenants who lived in #1303: Yukiyo Sugiuchi and her mother who, during the first few years, lived peacefully together at their apartment. This however changed when the mother becomes abusive towards Yukiyo for hiding food and having her ears pierced, which prompts her to rip the earring out of Yukiyo's earlobe. Yukiyo defensively reacts to her mother’s violent reaction with a butcher knife, then watches while her mother crawls into a closet where she eventually bleeds to death. Six months later, the landlord visits Yukiyo’s apartment and reveals his plans to have her and mother thrown out for failing to pay rent. Upset and afraid, Yukiyo sees the ghost of her mother, who’s revealed to have been tormenting Yukiyo since her death. “You’ll never survive without me,” her ghostly mother taunts. Yukiyo picks up a teddy bear and after she touches it gently, she walks to her apartment balcony and jumps to her death. Mariko discovers that since Yukiyo’s death, the next four tenants - with Sayaka as the latest - had moved into #1303 and eventually jumped to their death. The police has ruled each case as a suicide. Detective Sakurai returns the earring to Mariko and says that he thinks Mariko didn’t commit suicide while she was inside #1303 because she still lives with her mother. As Mariko absorbs this, she learns her mother plans to visit #1303 to see Sayaka one more time. She has to save her mother. Unknown to Mariko, the apartment has been rented out to several female college students, who throw a party that night. During the party, Yukiyo appears and pushes some girls over the balcony while terrorising the other party guests. As Mariko arrives at the block of apartments, she spots the authorities removing the bodies from the scene. She rushes up to #1303. As she enters, she doesn’t see her mother who’s closing a door. She disappears when Mariko opens it. Yukiyo appears in front of Mariko who confronts her over her killing of previous tenants including her own sister, but Yukiyo denies the charge, which disconcerts Mariko. However, as Yukiyo becomes hostile towards Mariko, she reveals that her mother is the one who told her to throw them over because they were evil. Mariko returns Yukiyo’s earring to her while promising to look after #1303 and Yukiyo herself. Yukiyo seems to accept this and vanishes, causing Mariko to faint. As Mariko awakens the following morning, Yukiyo appears and knocks her against the balcony railing. Yukiyo tells her that her mother has only one daughter.

Truth being, he is."" Wolfe lives in an opulent Manhattan brownstone on West 35th Street, where he enjoys reading, the cultivation of rare orchids, beer, and fine food prepared by his resident chef, Fritz Brenner (Colin Fox. The brownstone is also home to Archie, Wolfe's confidential assistant and legman, whose responsibilities include goading his sedentary boss into working occasionally to replenish the coffers. When Archie joins him in the dining room, Wolfe is unfazed by the news that he is overdrawn at the bank — but he is taken aback at the discovery that Fritz has altered one of his favorite dishes without consulting him. The resulting tantrum prompts Archie to do something uncharacteristic when the doorbell rings: admit one of the neighborhood kids, Pete Drossos ([[Robert Clark , who says he has to see Nero Wolfe. Pete has a case. He tells Wolfe he works the wipe racket — cleaning the windshields of cars stopped at intersections, for the occasional tip. About an hour before, Pete saw a good-looking woman wearing large gold earrings shaped like spiders, at the wheel of a 1952 Cadillac. As Pete wiped her windshield the woman mouthed the words, ""Help. Get a cop."" A male passenger stuck a gun in her ribs and the car drove off. Pete wrote down the license number. If the woman is found dead, Pete believes he can claim a reward by identifying the man who was with her. Since the case is too big for him to handle alone, Pete asks Nero Wolfe to go 50-50. Wolfe instructs Archie to call the police, to suggest they do a routine check on the license plate number, and Pete hurries home to his mother. The next evening Sergeant Purley Stebbins  of Manhattan Homicide visits Wolfe's office. The car Archie had called the police about the previous evening has just been seen to run down and kill a boy — a boy named Peter Drossos. Stebbins' visit is interrupted by the arrival of Pete's mother , who is there to do what her dying boy asked her to do: ""Go to Mr. Wolfe. Tell him what happened. Give Mr. Wolfe the money. Tell him to find the guy who ran me down."" After Mrs. Drossos leaves, Wolfe tells Archie to return Pete's money — $4.30 — or give it to the Red Cross. Archie refuses and instead drafts a newspaper ad directed at the woman Pete saw at the wheel of the Cadillac. Archie is sure the ad will never be answered, but it will give Wolfe the feeling that he has earned his fee. But the ad does draw Inspector Cramer  of Manhattan Homicide, who wants to know what Wolfe is up to. The Cadillac has been found, along with evidence that it was used for another murder: that of an Immigration and Naturalization Service agent named Matthew Birch. The ad then attracts a woman reluctant to give her name — and she is wearing golden spider earrings. She offers $500 for information about the boy who saw her driving the car. After Wolfe explains that the boy is dead and the police are searching for the driver, the woman is shaken. She identifies herself as Laura Fromm , a wealthy widow and philanthropist. She admits she was not driving the car, presents Wolfe with a $10,000 retainer for his expert advice, and promises to return the next day. First she must see someone, find out something. Wolfe accepts the retainer and warns Mrs. Fromm sternly about the danger of asking any questions herself, since two people have already been killed. Mrs. Fromm is not on time for her appointment the next day. Instead, Wolfe is visited by two attorneys who report that Mrs. Fromm has been run down and killed by a car. One is executor of her estate; the other is Dennis Horan , an attorney for the Association of European Refugees, a humanitarian organization with which Mrs. Fromm was closely involved. When asked to return the hefty retainer, Wolfe tells the lawyers that he intends to earn the money by finding the murderer. Freelance operatives Saul Panzer , Orrie Cather  and Fred Durkin  are called in to assist — to investigate the refugee organization, trace the distinctive golden spider earrings, and see if anything comes of Wolfe's conjecture that Matthew Birch was the passenger in the Cadillac. The inquiry reveals a blackmail ring that is victimizing hundreds of vulnerable people. In the final scene, Archie meets with Pete's mother in the office and gives her half of Laura Fromm's $10,000 retainer, saying that Pete and Wolfe had agreed to take equal shares of any proceeds from the case. Even though she begins to cry — something Wolfe cannot bear — Archie reports to Wolfe that she kept her composure until she made it out the door."

But the plague had another, indirect and far reaching consequence on the politics of the country. The behaviour of the military which was called out to deal with the situation arising from the pestilence caused great indignation. On 22 June in 1897, British officer Charles Walter Rand Assistant Collector of Pune and Chairman of the Special Plague Committee, Pune, and British Army officer Lieutenant Charles Egerton Ayerst, were assassinated on the Ganeshkhind road, Pune, on their way back from a Government house party celebrating the Diamond Jubilee anniversary of the coronation of Queen Victoria. C. W. Rand of the ICS was appointed to take charge of the plague control measures and had successfully contained the epidemic; but his methods of evacuating the people, of fumigating their dwellings, and burning the contaminated articles, evoked tremendous hatred amongst certain sections of the society, which led to his assassination. The climax scene is the shooting, after the midnight party finished, the carriages started moving out of the Government House, one of the boys in that group watched from outside the gate. As Rand came out, he gave the signal. Another boy began running with the carriage. As he reached the spot where Damodar, Balkrishna and others were waiting, he shouted to them ‘Gondya ala re! ’. Balkrishna jumped on the carriage and shot the occupant. But there was a mistake. It was Ayerst whom he had killed. They realised their mistake. When Rand’s carriage came to the spot, Damodar climbed on it and shot Rand. Ayerst was killed on the spot, and Rand died in hospital on 3 July 1897.<ref name 22 June 1897 – Film | author 5 November 2009 | newsgroup 106320 | url 6 March 2009}}  Damodar Hari's narration of the shooting differs from the events as shown in the film. In his autobiography Damodar Hari writes that he believed the jubilee celebrations would cause Europeans of all ranks to go to the Government House, and this would give them the opportunity to kill Rand. The brothers Damodar Hari and Balkrishna Hari selected a spot of Ganeshkhind road, by the side of a yellow bungalow to shoot at Rand. Each armed with a sword and a pistol. Balkrishna in addition carried a hatchet. They reached Ganeshkhind, they saw what looked like Rand's carriage pass by, but they let it go, not being sure, deciding to attack him on his way back. They reached Government House at 7.00–7.30 in the evening, as darkness was beginning to set in. A large number of people had gathered to witness the spectacle at Government House, and there were bonfires on the hills. The swords and the hatchet they carried made movement without raising suspicion difficult, so they deposited them under a stone culvert near the bungalow, so as to retrieve it in case of need. As planned, Damodar Hari waited at the gate of the Government House, and as Rand's carriage emerged, ran 10–15 paces behind it. As the carriage reached the yellow bungalow, Damodar made up the distance, and called out ""Gondya"", a predetermined signal for Balkrishna to take action. Damodar Hari undid the flap of the carriage, raised it and fired from a distance of about a span. It was originally planned that both would shoot at Rand, so as to ensure that Rand would not live, however Balkrishna Hari lagged behind and Rand's carriage rolled on, Balkrishna Hari meanwhile on the suspicion that the occupants of the following carriage were whispering to each other, fired at the head of one of them from behind."

Arriving at the airport moments later they are reunited and embrace. This scene abruptly ends and is revealed to be an excerpt from Ethan’s latest written work. His agent , upon finishing the novel, informs him that it is “unrealistic” and will not be published. Disappointed and exhausted from his many attempts at being published, Ethan retreats to a local café and while recording his thoughts into his personal journal meets waitress Jesse  and is instantly smitten with her outgoing personality, beauty and charm. He asks for her phone number so they can go on a date together and she cheerfully agrees. Moments after Ethan leaves, a handsome patron named Troy  enters the café and also asks Jesse on a date to which she also agrees. As Ethan and Jesse begin to date, he learns that she was once married and that her marriage failed because she “was not the right girl” for her ex-husband. Ethan begins writing a new novel at the time that he and Jesse begin dating. Ethan, who manages the apartment building he lives in in order to live rent free, seems to be the exact opposite of the much more financially successful and suave Troy, an advertising executive. Despite this, Ethan and Jesse’s relationship blossoms and deepens and he falls in love with her, as does Troy. Throughout the film, it is apparent through conversations with her brother and uncle  that Jesse is struggling over how to tell Ethan her “secret”. She knows that Ethan desires a family and is enthralled by his interaction with his sister’s children. After Ethan proposes marriage to her Jesse becomes emotionally distraught over fear of revealing the truth and decides to end their relationship and leave town with Troy, who had asked her to move to another city with him to expand his business. Heartbroken but determined to fulfill his promise to Jesse to finish his novel, Ethan submits his work and is overjoyed when he receives word from his agent that his novel will be published. As he is on the phone with his agent he receives a missed call from Jesse who is checking in at the airport. He tries to return her call but she has turned off her cell phone in the meantime. Just as in the beginning of the film, Ethan rushes to her apartment to tell her how much he loves her but her brother informs him that she has left for the airport. Ethan then races off to the airport only to find that he has missed Jesse’s flight. He returns home and is surprised to find Jesse waiting for him in his apartment. She tearfully expresses her wish to be honest with him, but he decides to share his news with her first. He shows her his new novel, Troy Meets Girl. It is revealed at this point that the relationship between Jesse and Troy was fictional; Troy had been created by Ethan as a more wealthy and successful version of himself for his novel. Jesse was not leaving with another man, but rather for a job in another city for a fresh start. Jesse then reveals her secret to Ethan—she cannot bear children. Ethan quickly responds that this does not matter to him and that they can adopt if need be. He again proposes marriage and this time Jesse accepts. The film ends with Jesse and Ethan getting married and driving off in his car, which stalls and needs to be pushed by the wedding party.

While Charmoussey is relatively poor, Upper-Charmoussey enjoys the luxuries of a ski resort and thus a better economy than its sister village. The rivalry is also stressed because of the local beauty pageant, where the better trained and dressed girls of Upper-Charmoussey always win the contest. Since the size of both municipalities is very small, the local government has decided to merge Charmoussey into Upper-Charmoussey, this leaves the inhabitants of Charmoussey desperate because it is their last chance to win the beauty contest. In order to achieve that, they call the only person who has had any success outside the village, Franck  a second rate actor, who has been engaged mostly as an extra in many films  and is currently down on his luck after causing an accident that resulted in breaking the leg of actress Catherine Deneuve . It is revealed that he left the village because he was regarded as strange and because his father was an eccentric scientist who died in trying a flying suit. He feels uneasy at coming back to his hometown but also recognizes that he cannot afford not to, so he uses his limited showbiz knowledge to train the local girls. Meanwhile the inhabitants of Upper-Charmoussey have learned from the local postman that Franck has been engaged in training the contestants and start a counter espionage campaign of their own.

In the second part of the film the experts argue that the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan was an artificial creation of 19th century British policy which has no reality for the Taliban, who, with the assistance of the weakened Pakistani government, which fears Indian encirclement, have re-invented themselves as a Pashtu nationalist army intent on controlling both countries.  In the third part of the film the experts argue that supply problems in a rural, mountainous, landlocked country, lack of oversight and accountability on private contractors resulting in war profiteering and hidden costs such as care for veterans have created an unsustainably expensive war which has contributed to the financial crisis.  In the fourth part of the film the experts, supported by interviews and disturbing footage from destroyed communities and IDP  camps, that the bombardment of villages and mosques resulting in the deaths and dismemberment of innocent civilians including children is converting villagers into suicide bombers for the Taliban.  In the fifth part of the film the experts argue that, due to the increased militarisation of the society and misogynist Mujahedeen who have taken key positions in the government and judiciary, violence against women, including rape, child abduction and acid attacks, has increased and statistics about literacy, age range and maternal and infant mortality have not improved since the US invasion.  In the sixth and final part of the film the experts argue that the avowed aim of making America more secure is untrue and the world is now less safe for Americans and American operations overseas as terrorism has increased due to the US governments attempts to fight a conventional war in Afghanistan where Al Qaeda no longer has a substantial presence.

After a news bulletin that a judge has made a ruling that will allow gay weddings to take place, the men purchase plane tickets and prepare to depart; however, before they leave, they discover that a challenge to the judge's ruling has resulted in a suspension of gay marriage in Hawaii, pending further judicial review. Ben takes advantage of the delay to inform Arthur that he is actually already married to a woman named Tammy , whom he wed out of societal pressure before he came to terms with his homosexuality and from whom he has been separated since before he and Arthur met. Arthur becomes angry, but decides to stay with Ben anyway. Shortly thereafter, Ben contacts Tammy, finally comes out to her, and asks her for a divorce. After the disappointment of their near-wedding, Ben and Arthur resume their daily life, working in a small diner in Los Angeles, where Ben is a dishwasher and Arthur is a waiter. Although Ben—a former nurse who quit to pursue a music career—enjoys the manual labor and hours, Arthur has grown impatient with servitude and putting up with needy customers. One night, Arthur decides to quit and go back to college, so that he can earn an MBA and open up his own sex shop. Although the loss of income to the household means that Ben will have to quit and return to being a nurse, he agrees to do so in order to help Arthur pursue his dream. To finance his education, Arthur tracks down his estranged brother, Victor , whom he hasn't spoken to for seven years. Victor is a religious fanatic who believes that Arthur's homosexuality is a sign of demonic possession, although Victor himself appears to be flamboyantly gay-- even greeting Arthur in a pink, feathered bathrobe. Although Victor lashes out at Arthur for his failure to turn straight, he nonetheless offers to give Arthur money for college if he will bring Ben by the apartment and allow him to evangelize. While Arthur considers Victor's offer, he and Ben hire an attorney  to consult for advice on getting married. Despite Ben's still being legally married to Tammy, the attorney counsels them to travel to Vermont, be wed in a civil union, and then return to California and attempt to be recognized as members of a domestic partnership. The two take her advice, and are wed in a private ceremony in Vermont. Suspicious of Arthur's lack of response to his monetary offer, Victor hires a private investigator to tail Ben and Arthur. The PI tells Victor about the men's marriage and their attempts to get their union recognized in California. In response, Victor follows the attorney home one evening and shoots her to death in her apartment's parking garage. At the same time, Tammy arrives at Arthur's apartment and tries to force Ben to take her back at gunpoint, but Ben successfully disarms her and throws her out. Following their attorney's death, Ben and Arthur agree to come to Victor's apartment. Rather than evangelize, Victor and another congregant from his church, Stan , lash out at the couple with homophobic insults and slurs. When Ben and Arthur leave, Victor and Stan start making plans to exorcise the couple by feeding them Holy Water that Stan has cooked in his kitchen. The plot fails, and Ben and Arthur leave town to enjoy a honeymoon in Hawaii and allow the tension with Victor to blow over. In Ben and Arthur's absence, Victor is summoned to church by his priest, Father Rabin . Rabin informs him that he is being excommunicated because the congregation does not want the relative of a homosexual attending church services, fearful that he will bring them bad karma and negative energy. A dejected Victor reaches out to Stan for help, who helps Victor come to an agreement with Father Rabin that Victor will be permitted to rejoin the church if he successfully murders Ben and Arthur. To this end, they hire a hitman named Scott , whom Father Rabin has apparently used to kill homosexuals in the past. When Ben and Arthur return from Hawaii, Ben is gay bashed by Victor and Scott; the attack fails to kill him, and Ben is hospitalized. Suspecting his brother's involvement, Arthur breaks into Victor's apartment and taps his phone. After intercepting a call implicating Victor and Father Rabin, Arthur goes to Victor's church, chloroforms Father Rabin, and then murders him by burning the church down with Rabin still inside. After Ben has sufficiently recovered, Arthur takes him back home to their apartment. Deciding that the next attempt on the men's lives must be more drastic, Victor and Scott go Ben and Arthur's apartment with guns; at the last minute, Victor tells Scott that he wants to kill them himself and sends him away. Victor rings the apartment's doorbell, and when Ben answers, he fatally shoots him. He then forces Arthur to strip naked at gunpoint and performs an impromptu baptism in the bathtub. While Victor contemplates what he's done, Arthur slips away and gets the gun that Ben had earlier confiscated from Tammy. Dressed in a bathrobe and briefs, a hysterical Arthur—reenacting one of the final scenes of Scarface-- propositions Victor while holding him at gunpoint, accusing him of lashing out to try to combat his own repressed homosexuality. When Arthur fires a warning shot, Victor pulls out his own gun and shoots Arthur in the chest and back several times. In turn, Arthur manages to fire off a single shot which hits Victor in the forehead and instantly kills him, before Arthur dies of his own wounds.

In addition to losing radio contact, the platoon is harassed by unseen North Korean infiltrators who silently kill the Americans and take their weapons. Platoon commander Lieutenant Benson  has only vague instructions to reach a certain hill to link up with American forces. The patrol stops a jeep driven by Sergeant ""Montana""  and shell shocked passenger ""the Colonel"" ([[Robert Keith  from the First Cavalry Division. The Colonel is unable to speak and is tied to his seat. After the Battle of the Nakdong River, where ""our men fell like rain"", the tough experienced Montana decided he and his Colonel, whom he treats like his father, have had enough of the war. Benson commandeers their jeep for his platoon's equipment and the battle-fatigued Corporal Zwickley. The platoon makes its way towards the hill. Montana disobeys Benson by instinctively shooting a surrendering North Korean sniper, who turns out to have a concealed weapon inside his hat. Sergeant Killian is killed while covering the rear after absentmindedly filling his helmet net with flowers. Montana takes his place and feigns fatigue, luring the infiltrators into the open, where he kills them. The cynical Montana transforms the platoon back into a military formation while also curing Zwickley's neurosis by slapping him around. The platoon successfully carries on through sniper attack, artillery barrage, and land mines. When they reach the hill, they find it held by the North Koreans. Montana shoots three enemy soldiers disguised as Americans after a North Korean prisoner is used as bait and killed by his own men. Benson and his men launch an attack, but Montana and the Colonel sit it out. The Colonel comes to his senses, joins the assault, and is killed. Shamed, Montana joins Benson. They use grenades and a flamethrower to destroy a pillbox and machine gun nest. Only Benson, Montana, and Sergeant Riordan survive. When American reinforcements arrive, Montana produces a container of medals that the Colonel meant to award his men. Benson calls the roll as Montana throws the medals to the dead on the slope of the hill, while Elmer Bernstein's title song plays in the background."

A Polish prisoner named Jankowski, who has been on a death march from Auschwitz, brings a suitcase to the camp. When the inmates in the storage building open it, they discover a three-year old child. Jankowski tells them he is the son of a couple from the Warsaw Ghetto, both of whom perished. Prisoner Kropinski becomes attached to the boy, and begs Kapo André Höfel to save him. Höfel, who is a member of the camp's secret communist underground, consults with senior member Bochow. He is instructed to send the child on the next transport to Sachsenhausen. Höfel cannot bring himself to do so, and hides him. Jankowski is deported to Sachsenhausen alone. SS man Zweiling stumbles upon Höfel and his friend, fellow communist Pippig, as they play with the child. Knowing well that the American Army is approaching, Zweiling is convinced to turn a blind eye, hoping to present himself as a humane guard to the Americans. His wife tells him to get rid of the boy to avoid punishment by his superiors. Zweiling writes a denunciation letter to the Gestapo, making it appear as if it was composed by a prisoner. Kluttig and Reineboth, two other SS officers, realize that Zweiling was the informant, but choose to ignore it; they begin to search for the child. Kluttig is keen on massacring the camp's surviving prisoners, but commandant Schwahl forbids it, fearing American retribution - although he knows of the secret resistance. Kluttig and Reineboth brutally torture Höfel and Kropinski, but they refuse to tell the boy's whereabouts. The resistance's leaders meet to discuss the crisis, that may bring about an SS crackdown before their planned uprising. They determine to save the child, who is hidden in a barrack. Reineboth takes all the personnel of the storage chamber to an investigation by the Gestapo. Pippig is subject to horrible torture. After seeing his injuries, prisoner August Rose has a nervous breakdown and confesses all. Pippig dies of his wounds. Kluttig raids the barrack, but cannot find the child. The SS plan to evacuate the camp. They order camp elder Krämer, who is also the communists' covert leader, to organize the prisoners for transport. Krämer manages to stall the preparations by pretending to cooperate. Resistance leader Bogorski, a Soviet prisoner-of-war, reveals that he hid the child on his own, where Kluttig would not find him. As the deadline for evacuation nears, the boy is taken out from his hiding. Kluttig enters the room where the inmates are gathered, intending to shoot the child, but the prisoners form a wall around him and force Kluttig to leave. Krämer orders an armed uprising. The prisoners, led by Bogorski, drive out the remaining SS. Most of them survive and flee wearing civilian clothing. Höfel and Kropinski are freed from their cells. Krämer takes the boy out as the camp is liberated.

Things seem to go awry when Greg's father-in-law Jack Byrnes  visits. Recently, Jack has been diagnosed with a heart condition and become embittered by his daughter Debbie's divorce from her husband, Bob , for cheating on her with a nurse. Jack's plan was originally to name Bob as his successor of the Byrnes family, but decides to pass the role to Greg, naming him ""The Godfocker"". Despite Greg begrudgingly accepting the role, Jack begins to suspect Greg of infidelity when he sees him with a drug rep, Andi Garcia , who openly flirts with him, and the presence of Sustengo erection pills in Greg's house, which prompts Jack to think Greg is no longer sexually attracted to his wife, Pam . Furthermore, Jack starts to doubt Greg's ability to provide for his family when he appears reluctant to send his children to a private school. During a medical conference promoting Sustengo, Greg meets Bob at a bar. Bob tells Greg of Jack's original intention to name him as successor, ""The Bobfather"", and expresses relief and happiness at leaving Jack's family, which makes Greg slightly uncomfortable. Jack, for his part, starts to speak with Pam about the possibility of divorcing Greg and renewing her relationship with her ex-fiancée, Kevin Rawley . Eventually, following a row at a clinic, Greg runs away from home to his and Pam's unfinished new house, where he is paid a visit by Andi, who tries to cheer him up with takeout and wine, but Andi soon becomes so drunk that she makes an aggressive sexual pass at Greg. While looking for Greg to apologise and bring him home, Jack pulls up to the house and sees, through the window, what he believes to be Greg and Andi having sex while Greg is trying to rebuff Andi's advances. Disgusted, Jack merely leaves, but tells Dina and Pam that he was unable to find Greg. At the twins' birthday party, Greg's parents, Bernie  and Roz  rejoin the family, but Jack, enraged at Greg's apparent infidelity, engages Greg in a physical fight, despite Greg insisting that Andi was drunk and he was rebuffing her. The fight culminates with Jack having a heart attack and collapsing. As he is taken away by paramedics, Jack quietly admits that he now believes Greg after feeling his carotid artery, which remained stable while Greg was claiming his innocence. Four months later on Christmas Day, Greg and Pam's parents come to spend Christmas with them in their new house.

While a university student, he fell hard for a woman named Yun-kyung, but circumstances and his lack of nerve prevented him from ever getting close to her, despite the fact that she seemed to be interested in him. Years later Gwang-sik, who now has a small photography studio with his assistant Il-woong, runs into Yun-kyung again. But has anything really changed in him? Gwang-sik has a younger brother, Gwang-tae. Gwang-tae experiences none of the problems that plague his brother. For him, picking up women is almost an unconscious habit. Getting them into bed is a piece of cake. Disposing of them afterwards is no less simple, excepting the times when they track him down and throw rocks through his window. One day, however, he meets a woman named Kyung-jae who is just a little too smart, too attractive, and too mature for him to handle. Suddenly, he feels just as confused about relationships as his brother Gwang-sik.

A blind resident discovers a rotting zombie washed up in the sand, who wakes up. The blind resident's fate is unknown. On September 25, 2003, Iranian-American girl Frida Abbas  has returned to Port Gamble, her home town after dropping out of Princeton University. She runs into her neighbor, Joe Miller at a gas station with his wife, Judy, and their teenage son, Brian. The family mistakenly refers to her as an Iraqi, much to Frida's confusion. Meanwhile, gay couple Tom Hunt  and Lance Murphy  arrive in Port Gamble to tell Tom's mother that he is gay. While Tom and Lance explore the town, many island residents appear to have been zombified, including a police officer. Frida arrives at her house and finds her dad, Ali, praying. Ali lectures Frida that she should be more proud of her Iranian heritage. Frida sneaks out of the house with her boyfriend, Derek . Tom and Lance are having dinner with Tom's mom, who reveals that she was bitten earlier by a bystander at the store. While showing signs of infection, she goes into the kitchen to prepare dessert and Tom admits that he is gay while his mom becomes a zombie and tries to attack Lance. Lance pins her to the wall with a fireplace poker and discovers more zombies walking towards the house. The TV news reveals that Port Gamble is experiencing a bio-terrorism attack, which turns its victims into zombies. While Frida and Derek are outside, Derek's face is horrifically ripped off and eaten by a zombie. Ali leaves the house to look for his daughter, while Frida escapes from a group of zombies to her abandoned and surrounded house. Judy calls for her from her barricaded home. Frida and Judy hide in the basement with Brian and Joe; Judy is bitten by a zombie while helping Frida inside. While watching the news, Joe sees that a terrorist claiming responsibility for the outbreak is wearing the same necklace as Frida. He ties Frida to a chair and asks her questions about U.S. history, much to Brian's disgust. Tom and Lance find Mrs. Banks (a teacher, mayoral candidate, and Mayor Burton's . They run into the local church where Reverend Haggis , Mayor Burton, Larry, a married couple, a local senior woman, and another churchgoer are playing bingo. At first, the church folks do not believe Tom, Lance, and Mrs. Banks, but are quickly convinced when one of the churchgoers goes outside and they hear him screaming as he is slowly killed. They immediately begin to board the windows. Reverend Haggis believes that the zombies outside are a part of the apocalypse. Back in the basement, Joe nails Frida's foot to the ground and begins to move a flame from a blow torch towards her face when Brian smashes a hole in his father's head with a hammer. Brian is able to lift the nail out of Frida's foot just before he is attacked and eaten by the zombified Judy. The wounded Joe watches in disbelief as his wife devours Brian. As Mayor Burton starts to show obvious signs of infection, Mrs. Banks suggests quarantining him in a room, which causes Mayor Burton to rebel against her. Tom and Lance lecture Mayor Burton, which makes Reverend Haggis decide to turn Lance and Tom into straights by drugging them and making them watch gay ""erotic"" films, which appears to be a method similar to the Ludovico technique. Larry and the married couple go downstairs to assist Haggis in the process, locking themselves in the basement. Mayor Burton reanimates into a zombie and bites the senior woman's jaw off, leaving Mrs. Banks alone with the zombie. As Lance is being drugged, Tom threatens the group with Larry's gun and forces them to let Mrs. Banks in. Mayor Burton enters with her. Larry and the couple quickly run out of the church with Tom, Lance, and Mrs. Banks following while Reverend Haggis attempts to talk to Burton, but is beaten half to death using his own torn-off arm. Frida makes it home to her father, who turns into a zombie and she is forced to kill him. She prepares to commit suicide with her father's shotgun, but hears a helicopter. She runs out of the house into a playground full of zombies and the still-living Joe Miller. In a struggle, Joe tries to handcuff Frida to a slide but Frida breaks loose from his grip and handcuffs him to the slide and runs off. Joe cries that he's sorry and that he was stupid. Frida says that she forgives him but refuses to release him. The zombies devour Joe. Frida soon finds Tom, Lance, and Mrs. Banks and saves them from a zombie. They leave to find the helicopter where U.S. soldiers rescue them and take them to refuge. Six months later, Port Gamble is out of quarantine and begins to be repopulated. Mrs. Banks is now mayor of the town and Frida is running her deceased dad's diner. Tom and Lance visit her and propose that she stay with them in New York. She declines but promises that she will visit them soon. Tom and Lance leave the island while Larry and the married couple enjoy a meal at Frida's diner. The film ends with shots of a wall of remembrance and Mayor Banks putting a flower next to a picture of Burton."

He asks for a private audience to confess his sins, to which the archbishop agrees. Besides conceding on his lewd behavior, Don Marcos reveals the archbishop that the plot he has sold to the church is overvalued, since a major road will soon run through it. The archbishop threatens to sue him and his company, to which Don Marcos reminds him that this fact has been revealed to him under confession, and therefore, cannot be revealed under penalty of excommunion. The archbishop reluctantly absolves the manager of his sins, and Don Marcos returns to his office, expressionless. * La Gran Noche - an aging prostitute is being teased by her fellow sex workers on the bordello they all work at.

The passion and magic of their initial courtship has been replaced by routine and boredom. Needing to get away, Alexandre visits the beachfront cottage of his friends, Ti  and Maude . There he meets a beautiful young woman, Fanfan , who is Maude's granddaughter and a student at Maude's school, studying to become a perfumer or Nose. Although they sleep in the same bed that night, Alexandre avoids any physical contact. The next day they are joined by Ti and Maude, who become confidants to their guests. Fanfan takes Alexandre to an old abandoned house where they learn more about each other in the quiet comfort of her childhood ""hideout"". Back at his apartment, Alexandre discovers his fiancé in the bedroom dressed as an Italian call girl, hoping the charade will excite his libido and rejuvenate their relationship—but the charade does not work. Later at her parents' house, Alexandre becomes even more discouraged by Laure's father's talk of him joining the funeral business and the gloomy outlook on marriage. Meanwhile, Fanfan confesses to a friend that she is in love with Alexandre. For Alexandre, however, things are more complicated. He explains to Ti that his past relationships have all followed the same disappointing pattern—the seduction and passion at the start is inevitably replaced with routine and boredom once a relationship becomes sexual. When asked what the alternative is, Alexandre offers his solution: Platonic love. To avoid the banality of ""coupledom"" in his new relationship with Fanfan, he will court her forever without ever revealing his love for her. He'll never kiss her or take their relationship to a physical level, reasoning that excitement is found in unfulfilled desire. He will stay with Laure physically, but will stay in love with Fanfan forever. Alexandre and Fanfan meet for a date at a beautiful upscale apartment, which Alexandre says belongs to his father. While Fanfan reveals personal and intimate details about her life, Alexandre prepares all her favorite foods from childhood, and the two share a romantic evening by candlelight. The perfect evening is interrupted, however, when the apartment's owner returns home with his wife, who proceeds to call the police as Alexandre and Fanfan make their escape. Alexandre blindfolds Fanfan and drives her to a television studio to a set designed to be Vienna in 1813. He dresses her in a ballroom gown, removes the blindfold, and they waltz together, gazing lovingly into each other's eyes. They end their magical evening with a bottle of champaigne on an imaginary balcony overlooking an imaginary Vienna, with Alexandre proposing a toast to their ""friendship"". Fanfan is clearly disappointed and annoyed with Alexandre's talk of ""friendship"", and she asks to be dropped off at the home of her friend Paul—a sculptor doing a nude study of her. Alexandre returns home to an equally annoyed Laure, who suspects he's been with another woman. Alexandre admits it, but assures her that nothing will ever come of it. As Laure plans out their wedding, Alexandre can actually see them turning into her parents. Laure knows something is wrong, saying, ""I wish I weren't yours so you would want me again."" Meanwhile, Fanfan complains to Maude about Alesandre's strange behavior. Unlike Alexandre, Fanfan believes in ""eternal passion for life."" Fanfan learns from Maude that Alexandre has been living with Laure for five years. Alexandre and Fanfan continue to socialize as friends, but the ""friendship"" only creates more frustration. They meet at a restaurant and Fanfan gives him an ultimatum: he must choose between Laure and her. While Alexandre claims to want only friendship, Fanfan knows he is attracted to her by his scent. Later when she isn't looking, Alexandre pours sleeping powder in her drink, and she falls into a deep sleep on the ride home. She wakes up on the beach at the cottage, where Alexandre watches over her and applies suntan lotion sensually on her back. Tempted by the half-naked Fanfan, he moves to kiss her when suddenly Laure arrives by boat and announces that the wedding plans are set and that she is pregnant. After congratulating the couple, Fanfan leaves in disgust. Unable to concentrate on her studies, Fanfan fails her perfumer final exams. Meanwhile, Alexandre discovers that Laure lied about being pregnant, and after he throws away the wedding invitations, Laure calls off the wedding. Alexandre then sees Fanfan boarding a bus to Italy, and he chases after her. When he reaches the bus at the next stop, he does not get on, and the bus pulls away. Later, Ti warns him that Fanfan will not wait forever. When Alexandre learns that she will be in Italy for ten days, he sets in motion his next plan. He rents the apartment next to Fanfan's apartment, knocks out the dividing wall, and installs a two-way mirror so he can see into her apartment while remaining hidden. Back from Italy, Fanfan and Alexandre arrange to spend the weekend at the beach cottage as friends. At the train station, however, Fanfan surprises Alexandre by bringing her sculptor friend, Paul. Clearly disappointed and jealous, Alexandre tells her that he and Laure have broken up and that her pregnancy was a lie. Fanfan simply responds, ""Too late."" At the beach, Paul announces that he and Fanfan are getting married, but back at the apartment, Alexandre discovers through the two-way mirror that their wedding plans were just a ruse to make Alexandre jealous, and that Fanfan is still in love with him. Later, after learning about the two-way mirror, Fanfan confronts Alexandre who is hidden behind the mirror. He confesses he did not get on the bus to Italy that day because he knew that in five years he would no longer be running after the bus. They kiss and embrace each other tenderly through the glass, but Fanfan says she needs more. ""I need to feel you in me,"" she says, but Alexandre cannot respond. Exasperated, Fanfan gives him another ultimatum: if he is not in her room by 10:00 pm, he'll never see her again. Alexandre does not show, and when he returns to his apartment, he sees that she's moved out and left a note that she is going to see her sister. Devastated that she's gone, Alexandre calls Maude only to find out that Fanfan's sister is dead, and she could not see her other than by committing a suicide. Alexandre envisions trying to get to Fanfan through endless bridal veil, and cries for being too late to touch her living body. Just then the mirror is cracked—Fanfan has broken the wall of glass between them. The two kiss and embrace, and Fanfan tells him he has until the morning to win her back."

Tempted by the half-naked Fanfan, he moves to kiss her when suddenly Laure arrives by boat and announces that the wedding plans are set and that she is pregnant. After congratulating the couple, Fanfan leaves in disgust. Unable to concentrate on her studies, Fanfan fails her perfumer final exams. Meanwhile, Alexandre discovers that Laure lied about being pregnant, and after he throws away the wedding invitations, Laure calls off the wedding. Alexandre then sees Fanfan boarding a bus to Italy, and he chases after her. When he reaches the bus at the next stop, he does not get on, and the bus pulls away. Later, Ti warns him that Fanfan will not wait forever. When Alexandre learns that she will be in Italy for ten days, he sets in motion his next plan. He rents the apartment next to Fanfan's apartment, knocks out the dividing wall, and installs a two-way mirror so he can see into her apartment while remaining hidden. Back from Italy, Fanfan and Alexandre arrange to spend the weekend at the beach cottage as friends. At the train station, however, Fanfan surprises Alexandre by bringing her sculptor friend, Paul. Clearly disappointed and jealous, Alexandre tells her that he and Laure have broken up and that her pregnancy was a lie. Fanfan simply responds, ""Too late."" At the beach, Paul announces that he and Fanfan are getting married, but back at the apartment, Alexandre discovers through the two-way mirror that their wedding plans were just a ruse to make Alexandre jealous, and that Fanfan is still in love with him. Later, after learning about the two-way mirror, Fanfan confronts Alexandre who is hidden behind the mirror. He confesses he did not get on the bus to Italy that day because he knew that in five years he would no longer be running after the bus. They kiss and embrace each other tenderly through the glass, but Fanfan says she needs more. ""I need to feel you in me,"" she says, but Alexandre cannot respond. Exasperated, Fanfan gives him another ultimatum: if he is not in her room by 10:00 pm, he'll never see her again. Alexandre does not show, and when he returns to his apartment, he sees that she's moved out and left a note that she is going to see her sister. Devastated that she's gone, Alexandre calls Maude only to find out that Fanfan's sister is dead, and she could not see her other than by committing a suicide. Alexandre envisions trying to get to Fanfan through endless bridal veil, and cries for being too late to touch her living body. Just then the mirror is cracked—Fanfan has broken the wall of glass between them. The two kiss and embrace, and Fanfan tells him he has until the morning to win her back."

The passion and magic of their initial courtship has been replaced by routine and boredom. Needing to get away, Alexandre visits the beachfront cottage of his friends, Ti  and Maude . There he meets a beautiful young woman, Fanfan , who is Maude's granddaughter and a student at Maude's school, studying to become a perfumer or Nose. Although they sleep in the same bed that night, Alexandre avoids any physical contact. The next day they are joined by Ti and Maude, who become confidants to their guests. Fanfan takes Alexandre to an old abandoned house where they learn more about each other in the quiet comfort of her childhood ""hideout"". Back at his apartment, Alexandre discovers his fiancé in the bedroom dressed as an Italian call girl, hoping the charade will excite his libido and rejuvenate their relationship—but the charade does not work. Later at her parents' house, Alexandre becomes even more discouraged by Laure's father's talk of him joining the funeral business and the gloomy outlook on marriage. Meanwhile, Fanfan confesses to a friend that she is in love with Alexandre. For Alexandre, however, things are more complicated. He explains to Ti that his past relationships have all followed the same disappointing pattern—the seduction and passion at the start is inevitably replaced with routine and boredom once a relationship becomes sexual. When asked what the alternative is, Alexandre offers his solution: Platonic love. To avoid the banality of ""coupledom"" in his new relationship with Fanfan, he will court her forever without ever revealing his love for her. He'll never kiss her or take their relationship to a physical level, reasoning that excitement is found in unfulfilled desire. He will stay with Laure physically, but will stay in love with Fanfan forever. Alexandre and Fanfan meet for a date at a beautiful upscale apartment, which Alexandre says belongs to his father. While Fanfan reveals personal and intimate details about her life, Alexandre prepares all her favorite foods from childhood, and the two share a romantic evening by candlelight. The perfect evening is interrupted, however, when the apartment's owner returns home with his wife, who proceeds to call the police as Alexandre and Fanfan make their escape. Alexandre blindfolds Fanfan and drives her to a television studio to a set designed to be Vienna in 1813. He dresses her in a ballroom gown, removes the blindfold, and they waltz together, gazing lovingly into each other's eyes. They end their magical evening with a bottle of champaigne on an imaginary balcony overlooking an imaginary Vienna, with Alexandre proposing a toast to their ""friendship"". Fanfan is clearly disappointed and annoyed with Alexandre's talk of ""friendship"", and she asks to be dropped off at the home of her friend Paul—a sculptor doing a nude study of her. Alexandre returns home to an equally annoyed Laure, who suspects he's been with another woman. Alexandre admits it, but assures her that nothing will ever come of it. As Laure plans out their wedding, Alexandre can actually see them turning into her parents. Laure knows something is wrong, saying, ""I wish I weren't yours so you would want me again."" Meanwhile, Fanfan complains to Maude about Alesandre's strange behavior. Unlike Alexandre, Fanfan believes in ""eternal passion for life."" Fanfan learns from Maude that Alexandre has been living with Laure for five years. Alexandre and Fanfan continue to socialize as friends, but the ""friendship"" only creates more frustration. They meet at a restaurant and Fanfan gives him an ultimatum: he must choose between Laure and her. While Alexandre claims to want only friendship, Fanfan knows he is attracted to her by his scent. Later when she isn't looking, Alexandre pours sleeping powder in her drink, and she falls into a deep sleep on the ride home. She wakes up on the beach at the cottage, where Alexandre watches over her and applies suntan lotion sensually on her back. Tempted by the half-naked Fanfan, he moves to kiss her when suddenly Laure arrives by boat and announces that the wedding plans are set and that she is pregnant.

3912910As people are enjoying drinks in a bar, a man covered in blood - identified onscreen as ""Hero""  - enters through the door and warns them all of impending danger. No one heeds his warning, so he shows the bar patrons the head of a repulsive creature to make them take him seriously. He is soon pulled through a window and decapitated by one of the monsters, amusingly just after it was implied that his chances of survival were very high. After the carnage, a woman - ""Heroine""  - bursts through the door and reveals herself to be the recently deceased man's wife. After a brief sentimental moment between the wife and her late husband, they begin boarding up the windows in the bar. Despite their efforts, a young monster bursts through an uncovered window and begins decapitating the people inside the bar. It dismembers one of the women - ""Harley Mom""  - and it is initially assumed that she died from massive blood loss. The monster disappears for some time, then is found attempting to sexually penetrate one of the deer heads nailed to the wall. A shotgun blast removes the deer head and monster from the wall. The monster drops into a freezer which is then sealed shut, trapping it inside. Following this, the remaining windows are boarded up and the bar patrons are given a moment of peace. Trying to call for help, they learn that the only phone in the bar has been hit by a stray shotgun blast and has been rendered useless. After a short breather, one of the women - ""Tuffy""  - suddenly realizes that her son is still upstairs and runs to get him. Once she finds her child the group rejoices until the boy is pulled through a window and eaten by one of the monsters, leaving only his sneaker behind. Tuffy is now incapacitated by grief, and the monster then vomits a stream of slime at one of the group - ""Beer Guy"" . As the remaining people regroup downstairs, they realize that the slime has a decomposing effect and that the victim is being slowly overcome by its effects. The group kills the young monster in the freezer and hangs it outside. The monster's parents quickly have sex and produce two offspring in a matter of seconds, all of whom begin to attack the pub with renewed fury. Meanwhile, one of the women - ""Honey Pie"" ([[Jenny Wade  - begins washing off the blood and has to take off her clothes, much to the amusement of the others. The patrons regroup and enact various attempts to escape or drive off the monsters, all of which lead to more casualties, including the accidental death of the Heroine at the hands of another character . Driven by rage over the death of her child, Tuffy aggressively takes charge of the remaining survivors, which results in the audience seeing her nickname change from ""Tuffy"" to ""Heroine 2"". ""Honey Pie"" successfully makes it to a truck, giving the other characters brief cause for hope . After many attacks and ultimately, a fight to the death between the last remaining humans and monsters, only four people survive the ordeal: Bozo, Hot Wheels, Tuffy , and Honey Pie. One person - ""Grandma""  - seems to survive but is seen being attacked by one of the remaining monsters at the end of the film.
3681139The Texas State University Fightin' Armadillos were once one of the most powerful teams in college football. However, shortly after winning consecutive national championships, massive NCAA violations resulted in the program having to forfeit several years' worth of victories. All of the previous players and coaches are banned from returning except Charlie Banks, the only ""clean"" player, who never got to play despite having ""heart"". The new coaching staff, led by Ed ""Straight Arrow"" Gennero , has nothing to assist them in building the team as no athletic scholarships are available, forcing them to hold tryouts. Along with this, they must worry about Dean Elias , who wants the team to fail so he can scrap it. However, the coaches soon have a makeshift team in place. Only 17 players are allowed on the team--not enough to have offense and defense--due to Dean Elias declaring many prospective players ineligible, so they are forced to play ironman football. The team lacks experience and talent in all areas, especially at quarterback, placekicker, and the defensive line. Assistant coach Wally ""Rig"" Riggendorf  recruits a 34 year old former high school star Paul Blake , who never attended college due to his father's death. Rig convinces him to enroll and play for the team. Blake arrives on campus and catches everyone's attention due to his age, especially Professor Carter . Paul then recruits a graduate student teaching assistant named Andre Krimm , who is also enrolled at the school and eligible to play for the team. Blake convinces him to join, and he is positioned on the defensive line, where he excelled years earlier. Even with the new members, the team continues to lose games. Things get so bad that, at one point during the film, announcer Chuck Neiderman  covers his microphone with his hands and screams, ""SHIT!!!!"" at the top of his lungs. Professor Carter tells Blake that she knows him from years earlier. Carter's ex-boyfriend was a high school football star, but Blake and his team humiliated him and his team in a championship game. This episode actually caused Carter to become infatuated with Blake. Now, years after the fact, the two begin a romantic relationship, which Dean Elias opposes, due to the fact that Blake is a student, and Carter is a teacher. Coach Rig makes one more recruiting move to secure a kicker. He shocks everybody by selecting Lucy Draper  from the school's soccer team. When she is brought on board, the team has its first taste of success, as Draper kicks a field goal in a driving rainstorm to forge a 3-3 tie with Kansas . After this game, Blake quits the team after arguments with the head coach  and Professor Carter, but convinces himself to come back after a teammate, who is also quitting, inadvertently changes his mind and both come back. With the coaches and players now on the same page, the team plays their last game of the season against the number one ranked team in the country, the University of Texas Colts, with whom the Armadillos were involved in a barroom brawl earlier in the season. They head into the game as huge underdogs, and without Coach Gennero, who is hospitalized just prior to the game, leaving Coach Rig in charge. After a horrible first half, they come back in the second half to make it a one point game with a few seconds left, and Gennero returns to the sideline, having only suffered from indigestion, though he lets Coach Rig call the final play. The team decides to try to win it all with a two-point conversion. They fake a point after attempt and pass for two. Blake scrambles and finally finds Banks in the end zone to win the game.
2762659{{plot}} Over the opening credits, police detective Jack Friar  is shown practicing Johannes Brahms' Trio #1 in B Major, Op.8 and injecting himself with insulin. His neighbor arrives and begs him to retrieve her daughter, who has been staying with her disreputable boyfriend on Turk Street. Friar protests that he is just a grand theft auto cop, and she needs to report the case to missing persons. He is packed and ready to go to a fantasy music camp in the Berkshires for two weeks, but he gives in to the neighbor's pleas and agrees to search for her daughter. On Turk Street, Friar shows the picture of the boyfriend to several people with no luck. As it begins to rain, he notices an elderly woman, Mrs. Quarre , who slips on her porch steps as she's carrying groceries. He runs to help her, and once inside, he meets her husband Thomas , and they make Friar a cup of tea. As they are sitting in the living room, Friar explains who he is looking for and reaches for the picture in order to show it to the Quarres. However, it blew away as he helped Mrs. Quarre with the groceries, and as he fumbles for it, Hoop  emerges and points a gun to his head. Friar is tied to a chair and a criminal plot quickly emerges, although the nature of it and the roles of the people in the house are unclear. The Quarres seem to be innocent quasi-hostages, much like himself. Hoop appears to be the near psychotic muscle man. The femme fatale is revealed to be a woman named Erin  who is involved with the ringleader Tyrone . When Tyrone is in the garden at one point, Erin and Hoop talk about running away together after their crime has been committed. The doorbell rings and it is a banker named David , who is the inside man for the heist. Erin informs him that the crime has been moved forward to today, and David thinks it's impossible. Erin says that it's the only way for the two of them to be together, and he agrees to help the team rob the bank ahead of schedule. Tyrone dispatches the Quarres to the airfield where they are to prepare a small plane for their escape to the Caribbean. He assigns Erin to stay at the house and guard Friar. She points out that David will expect to see her at the bank, but Tyrone insists that he can handle David. Tyrone and Hoop leave for the bank. Alone in the house together, Erin appears extremely sympathetic to Friar's plight. She explains that if she let him go, Tyrone would kill her. She shows Friar her right foot which is missing the second toe, claiming that Tyrone cut it off when she tried to leave him. At the bank, Hoop infiltrates the electrical system and causes a total blackout, leaving only the phone lines open. Tyrone impersonates a blind man making a $10 million transfer out of the bank, insisting that the transfer absolutely must happen by 6:00 PM. During the blackout, he uses David as a foil against the bank manager, pretending to be outraged that his transfer cannot go through. David offers to make the transfer on his laptop through a modem, much to his manager's relief. The manager hands Tyrone a disc with all the various account numbers and passwords for the transfers, but as Tyrone pretends to miss it with his outstretched hand due to his blindness, David grabs the disc. As David walks Tyrone out of the bank, he insists that he must see Erin before he hands over the disc, despite this being a departure from the plan. Tyrone and Hoop decide to go to David's house and ambush him. Meanwhile, on Turk Street, the lack of food has made Friar pass out. Erin realizes he is a diabetic and tries to revive him by dripping orange juice into his mouth. Out of desperation, she grabs his keys and wallet and drives his car to his apartment, where she finds his insulin in the refrigerator. Back at the house, she injects Friar and saves him from falling into a diabetic coma. Friar thanks her for saving his life and says that he owes her one. Erin comments on the packed bags that she noticed at Friar's apartment, and she reveals that she brought his cello back with her. Erin sits at the piano and begins to play a halting version of Chopsticks, by the end, she is playing a sophisticated, jazzlike version of the piece, revealing that she is also a musician. She explains that Tyrone rescued her from a collapsing Russia, where most of her friends went on to become prostitutes. Pointing the gun at Friar, she says she'll collect the debt he owes her for saving his life by making him play with her. She gives him a copy of Henri Duparc's Chanson Triste, and he sight reads it with her accompanying on piano. Afterward, he sits behind her and teaches her to play the cello. The two almost kiss, but Friar decides against it. He clearly has fallen for Erin, but the extent is unclear. He allows her to tie him up again, presumably so she will not be killed by Tyrone. At David's house, Hoop gets nowhere by roughing up the poor banker. He has password-protected the contents of the disc, and he refuses to divulge the password unless he sees Erin. Hoop brings Erin to David's house, leaving Friar alone on Turk Street. David insists on being alone with Erin, who coyly tries to hew to the plan that she leave with Tyrone for the Caribbean, returning for David in a few days. He wants to go with them, but Erin points out that he can't be seen with Tyrone ever again, promising that she'll return for him. David says, ""Enough promises"", and the two of them make love for the first time. Hoop gets more and more agitated as time goes by, finally barging into the room. Enraged by the sight of Erin and David in bed, he kills David without getting the password. Erin correctly guesses that the password is her name, and the three of them get in a car together, where Tyrone reveals that they are not going to meet the Quarres at the airfield. Realizing her various escape plans were being cut off, Erin concocts a story that Friar was lying about looking for a girl and was in fact looking for Tyrone, convincing Tyrone that they must return to Turk Street and kill him. Friar has loosened his bonds, and when Hoop attempts to strangle him, Friar stabs him in the neck with a corkscrew, killing him. Tyrone puts a gun in Erin's hand, trying to make her pull the trigger as her 'baptism', when the Quarres burst in with guns. The couple realized that they were being abandoned and want their cut of the bank money. As Mr. Quarre tries to take the disc from Tyrone, his shotgun goes off, killing Mrs. Quarre. Mr. Quarre is heartbroken and kills himself with her pistol. Friar convinces Tyrone, who is clearly averse to shedding blood himself, that as a cop, he can help them with their escape plan. The crew will drive to Albany and then on to the Canadian border, and Friar asserts that with the siren in his car and his badge, he can help them get to the border without incident. He asks that Erin be allowed to choose her own path from there: whether to be with Friar or Tyrone. Tyrone agrees, riding in the back seat with a shotgun aimed at Friar's back. Tyrone reveals that the $10 million has been transferred into multiple banks around Albany in smaller amounts which won't attract the attention that the original sum would. The trio spend the morning going to the various banks withdrawing the funds in cashier's checks. In order to still have the advantage over Friar, Tyrone calls each bank in advance and convinces them to allow him to withdraw the funds at the drive-thru. At one of the banks, Friar says that a security guard has written down their license plate number, convincing Tyrone that they need to stop and steal some new ones. On the way to Canada, Erin slides into the backseat with Tyrone, signaling that she will choose him, but she slips a pistol to Friar in the front seat. At the Canadian border, as they wait in line behind the other cars, Friar insists that the time has come for Tyrone to let them go. He turns around with the pistol and Tyrone fires the shotgun. Friar has placed the old license plates behind his back, shielding him from the blast. As Tyrone runs for the border with the shotgun, he is gunned down by the border police. Friar has to choose whether or not to turn Erin in, since only he knows if she was a hostage or a conspirator. She reminds him of how they almost kissed and says that they've each got their $1 million share of the cashier's checks which they could use to run away together. Friar reveals that he has torn his up and allows her to walk away. As she is leaving the border station, he tells a cop to arrest her.

He decides he wants to take care of them as their foster father. Danny is happy with the development, since he now has his sister and will have a nice home, but Anna is more apprehensive about being adopted by Bolt. During one of their outings, Anna uses her powers. As a result, the owner of the shop named Waldo Fudd  takes them aside, revealing that he possesses the same powers they do. He goes on to say that there are many more like them, all extraterrestrials from a planet where everyone has a twin. They came to Earth to explore, but all of them separated out of quarrels they experienced on Earth. Waldo has been working to reunite them all and take them home. Danny dismisses him as a joke, but Anna believes there is some truth to what he is saying.

Bolt reveals that he intends to use Anna and Danny to blast open Witch Mountain without explosives. When Anna discovers the truth, Bolt decides to separate them and use Anna as a hostage so Danny will do as he asks. At Witch Mountain, the two escape with help from Zoe, Bruno, Bolt's chauffeur Luthor , and Xander. Upon his plot being exposed by Luthor, Edward Bolt is arrested by Sheriff Bronson as Edward fires Luthor . It is here where Waldo and many other reunited twins are waiting for them.

456959The narrator, Angus Scrimm, in his only words in the film, introduces the audience to the creatures called ""djinn"" with the following statement: {{quote}} The next scene is set in Persia during the year 1127 A. D. with the djinn asking a Persian emperor to make his second wish. The emperor asks the djinn to show him wonders. The djinn uses his powers to torture and mutilate people in the palace. Before the emperor can make his third wish, Zoroaster, a sorcerer , interrupts and states that upon the third wish granted to the one who woke the djinn, a gateway will open between the worlds and the evil race of djinn can live on Earth. The sorcerer then reveals a fire opal. The djinn is sucked into the jewel, where he remains captured. In present day America, Raymond Beaumont  is supervising workers as they lower a box containing an antique statue of Ahura Mazda onto a ship's deck. The worker who is lowering the crate is drinking on the job and accidentally drops it from his crane, killing Beaumont's assistant  and destroying the statue. It breaks open and a dockworker finds the fire opal inside, which he steals and pawns. The jewel ends up at Regal Auctioneers, where boss Nick Merritt  gives it to appraiser Alexandra Amberson to examine. Her examinations of the jewel wake the djinn. Thinking she saw something inside the jewel, Alexandra takes it to her labworker, best friend and potential love interest Josh Aickman  to analyze. Later, as he is collecting data, light reflections cause the gem to explode and the djinn is released. The lab is destroyed and Josh is killed, upon his wish for relief from his physical pain. Alex, thinking the gem has something to do with the explosion and subsequent death of Josh, tracks down Beaumont, to whom the statue belonged. Beaumont tells Alex to visit a folklore professor named Wendy Derleth  to find out more about Ahura Mazda and the gem. He also invites Alex and her sister Shannon  to a party he is hosting. The folklore professor tells Alex about the jewel, the djinn and its evil history. Later, Alex learns that the djinn needs to power the gem with the soul of humans and then grant her three wishes before he can unleash the djinn on Earth. During this time, the djinn, who had been in demonic form, removes the face of a corpse in the morgue, taking on the dead man's form and the name Nathaniel Demerest. The djinn, now Nathaniel, goes about granting people wishes in return for their souls while he searches for Alex. He finally tracks down Alex's boss and grants him a greed-inflicted wish so that he can get Alex's address. Alex is haunted by visions whenever the djinn grants a wish. She goes to Wendy Derleth's house to consult with her again, but Nathaniel has already killed her and taken her form. During their conversation, Alex realizes she is really talking to the djinn. He confronts her and asks her to make three wishes. He even gives her a ""test"" wish. She uses this wish and orders the djinn to kill itself. He complies by blowing his head off with a gun, yet the wound heals instantly; as the djinn is immortal, he cannot be killed. Alex then uses the first of the ""official"" three wishes: her first being to know her opponent, the djinn. He teleports her to his terrifying world within the gem, thus demonstrating his true nature to her. Next, she wishes herself back to her apartment, alone. The Djinn had been threatening Alex's sister, so Alex sets about finding Shannon. She races to Beaumont's party and Nathaniel follows. While talking to Nathaniel at the party, Beaumont makes the mistake of wishing his party would be unforgettable, and Nathaniel begins wreaking havoc by causing the art pieces to kill the guests. The djinn finally corners Alex and traps Shannon, trying to scare Alex into making the ultimate third wish. Alex wishes that the dockworker had not been drinking on the job two days ago undoing the events that followed  and trapping the Djinn in the opal. The dock scene is shown again and the now sober operator has no trouble lowering the crate containing Ahura Mazda. Alex goes to see Josh at the lab. He notices that Alex is strangely pleased with herself, but she will not say why. Back on the statue of Ahura Mazda, which is now in Beaumont's private collection, the camera zooms inside the jewel and shows us the djinn on a throne, waiting to be released.
4140604In the film, South African musicians, playwrights, poets and activists recall the struggle against apartheid from the 1940s to the 1990s that stripped black citizens of South Africa of basic human rights, and the important role that music played in that struggle. The documentary uses a mixture of interviews, musical performances and historical film footage. Among the South Africans who take part are Miriam Makeba, Abdullah Ibrahim, Hugh Masekela, Vusi Mahlasela and others. The freedom songs heard in the film have an important historical context. Particularly in the United States, freedom songs have referred to protest songs of the abolitionist, civil rights, and labor movements. Yet, in South Africa, the songs take on a different meaning, referring to a unique collection of songs tied to the struggle for racial equality during the twentieth century. Stylistically, freedom songs originated in choir as a unifying and prevalent genre that combined southern African signing traditions with Christian hymns. Most of the songs have simple melodies and are sung a cappella. More importantly, they are composed and sung in groups, and often reflect changing political circumstances and attitudes.Olwage, Grant.

129246The film opens in 1950 with Pu Yi's re-entry into the just-proclaimed People's Republic of China as a political prisoner and war criminal, having been captured by the Red Army when the Soviet Union entered the Pacific War in 1945  and been in their custody for the past five years. Puyi attempts suicide, which only renders him unconscious. In a flashback, apparently triggered as a dream, Puyi relives his first entry, with his wet nurse at his side, into the Forbidden City. The next section of the film is a series of chronological flashbacks showing Puyi's early life: from his royal upbringing, to the tumultuous period of the early Chinese Republic, to his subsequent exile, his Japanese-supported puppet reign of Manchukuo, and then his capture by the Soviet army — all of which are intermixed with flash-forwards portraying his prison life. Under the “Communist re-education program” for political prisoners, Puyi is coerced by his interrogators to formally renounce his forced collaboration with the Imperial Japanese invaders for war crimes during their occupation of China during the war. Finally, after a heated discussion with the camp commandant and upon watching a propaganda film detailing the wartime atrocities committed by the Japanese, Puyi recants his previous stance and is set free and rehabilitated by the government in 1958. The concluding section of the film ends with a flash-forward to the mid-1960s during the Mao cult and the beginning of the Cultural Revolution. By now, Puyi has become a simple gardener who lives a peasant proletarian existence. On his way home from work, he happens upon a Red Guard parade, complete with children playing pentatonic music on accordions en masse and dancers who dance the rejection of landlordism by the Communists. His prison camp commander, his only friend during his incarceration, is forced to wear a dunce cap and a sandwich board bearing punitive slogans, and is one of the political prisoners now punished as an anti-revolutionary in the parade. Puyi later visits the Forbidden City as an ordinary tourist. There he meets an assertive little boy wearing the red scarf of the Pioneer Movement. The young Communist orders Puyi to step away from the throne. However, Puyi proves to the boy that he is indeed the Son of Heaven, proceeding to approach the throne. There, Puyi discovers the 60 year old pet cricket he kept as a child and gives it to the child. Amazed by the gift, the boy turns to talk to Puyi, but the emperor has disappeared. The film ends with a tour guide leading a tour in front of the throne, where the guide sums up Puyi's life in a few, brief sentences, concluding that he died in 1967.

3912910As people are enjoying drinks in a bar, a man covered in blood - identified onscreen as ""Hero""  - enters through the door and warns them all of impending danger. No one heeds his warning, so he shows the bar patrons the head of a repulsive creature to make them take him seriously. He is soon pulled through a window and decapitated by one of the monsters, amusingly just after it was implied that his chances of survival were very high. After the carnage, a woman - ""Heroine""  - bursts through the door and reveals herself to be the recently deceased man's wife. After a brief sentimental moment between the wife and her late husband, they begin boarding up the windows in the bar. Despite their efforts, a young monster bursts through an uncovered window and begins decapitating the people inside the bar. It dismembers one of the women - ""Harley Mom""  - and it is initially assumed that she died from massive blood loss. The monster disappears for some time, then is found attempting to sexually penetrate one of the deer heads nailed to the wall. A shotgun blast removes the deer head and monster from the wall. The monster drops into a freezer which is then sealed shut, trapping it inside. Following this, the remaining windows are boarded up and the bar patrons are given a moment of peace. Trying to call for help, they learn that the only phone in the bar has been hit by a stray shotgun blast and has been rendered useless. After a short breather, one of the women - ""Tuffy""  - suddenly realizes that her son is still upstairs and runs to get him. Once she finds her child the group rejoices until the boy is pulled through a window and eaten by one of the monsters, leaving only his sneaker behind. Tuffy is now incapacitated by grief, and the monster then vomits a stream of slime at one of the group - ""Beer Guy"" . As the remaining people regroup downstairs, they realize that the slime has a decomposing effect and that the victim is being slowly overcome by its effects. The group kills the young monster in the freezer and hangs it outside. The monster's parents quickly have sex and produce two offspring in a matter of seconds, all of whom begin to attack the pub with renewed fury. Meanwhile, one of the women - ""Honey Pie"" ([[Jenny Wade  - begins washing off the blood and has to take off her clothes, much to the amusement of the others. The patrons regroup and enact various attempts to escape or drive off the monsters, all of which lead to more casualties, including the accidental death of the Heroine at the hands of another character . Driven by rage over the death of her child, Tuffy aggressively takes charge of the remaining survivors, which results in the audience seeing her nickname change from ""Tuffy"" to ""Heroine 2"". ""Honey Pie"" successfully makes it to a truck, giving the other characters brief cause for hope . After many attacks and ultimately, a fight to the death between the last remaining humans and monsters, only four people survive the ordeal: Bozo, Hot Wheels, Tuffy , and Honey Pie. One person - ""Grandma""  - seems to survive but is seen being attacked by one of the remaining monsters at the end of the film.
3681139The Texas State University Fightin' Armadillos were once one of the most powerful teams in college football. However, shortly after winning consecutive national championships, massive NCAA violations resulted in the program having to forfeit several years' worth of victories. All of the previous players and coaches are banned from returning except Charlie Banks, the only ""clean"" player, who never got to play despite having ""heart"". The new coaching staff, led by Ed ""Straight Arrow"" Gennero , has nothing to assist them in building the team as no athletic scholarships are available, forcing them to hold tryouts. Along with this, they must worry about Dean Elias , who wants the team to fail so he can scrap it. However, the coaches soon have a makeshift team in place. Only 17 players are allowed on the team--not enough to have offense and defense--due to Dean Elias declaring many prospective players ineligible, so they are forced to play ironman football. The team lacks experience and talent in all areas, especially at quarterback, placekicker, and the defensive line. Assistant coach Wally ""Rig"" Riggendorf  recruits a 34 year old former high school star Paul Blake , who never attended college due to his father's death. Rig convinces him to enroll and play for the team. Blake arrives on campus and catches everyone's attention due to his age, especially Professor Carter . Paul then recruits a graduate student teaching assistant named Andre Krimm , who is also enrolled at the school and eligible to play for the team. Blake convinces him to join, and he is positioned on the defensive line, where he excelled years earlier. Even with the new members, the team continues to lose games. Things get so bad that, at one point during the film, announcer Chuck Neiderman  covers his microphone with his hands and screams, ""SHIT!!!!"" at the top of his lungs. Professor Carter tells Blake that she knows him from years earlier. Carter's ex-boyfriend was a high school football star, but Blake and his team humiliated him and his team in a championship game. This episode actually caused Carter to become infatuated with Blake. Now, years after the fact, the two begin a romantic relationship, which Dean Elias opposes, due to the fact that Blake is a student, and Carter is a teacher. Coach Rig makes one more recruiting move to secure a kicker. He shocks everybody by selecting Lucy Draper  from the school's soccer team. When she is brought on board, the team has its first taste of success, as Draper kicks a field goal in a driving rainstorm to forge a 3-3 tie with Kansas . After this game, Blake quits the team after arguments with the head coach  and Professor Carter, but convinces himself to come back after a teammate, who is also quitting, inadvertently changes his mind and both come back. With the coaches and players now on the same page, the team plays their last game of the season against the number one ranked team in the country, the University of Texas Colts, with whom the Armadillos were involved in a barroom brawl earlier in the season. They head into the game as huge underdogs, and without Coach Gennero, who is hospitalized just prior to the game, leaving Coach Rig in charge. After a horrible first half, they come back in the second half to make it a one point game with a few seconds left, and Gennero returns to the sideline, having only suffered from indigestion, though he lets Coach Rig call the final play. The team decides to try to win it all with a two-point conversion. They fake a point after attempt and pass for two. Blake scrambles and finally finds Banks in the end zone to win the game.
2762659{{plot}} Over the opening credits, police detective Jack Friar  is shown practicing Johannes Brahms' Trio #1 in B Major, Op.8 and injecting himself with insulin. His neighbor arrives and begs him to retrieve her daughter, who has been staying with her disreputable boyfriend on Turk Street. Friar protests that he is just a grand theft auto cop, and she needs to report the case to missing persons. He is packed and ready to go to a fantasy music camp in the Berkshires for two weeks, but he gives in to the neighbor's pleas and agrees to search for her daughter. On Turk Street, Friar shows the picture of the boyfriend to several people with no luck. As it begins to rain, he notices an elderly woman, Mrs. Quarre , who slips on her porch steps as she's carrying groceries. He runs to help her, and once inside, he meets her husband Thomas , and they make Friar a cup of tea. As they are sitting in the living room, Friar explains who he is looking for and reaches for the picture in order to show it to the Quarres. However, it blew away as he helped Mrs. Quarre with the groceries, and as he fumbles for it, Hoop  emerges and points a gun to his head. Friar is tied to a chair and a criminal plot quickly emerges, although the nature of it and the roles of the people in the house are unclear. The Quarres seem to be innocent quasi-hostages, much like himself. Hoop appears to be the near psychotic muscle man. The femme fatale is revealed to be a woman named Erin  who is involved with the ringleader Tyrone . When Tyrone is in the garden at one point, Erin and Hoop talk about running away together after their crime has been committed. The doorbell rings and it is a banker named David , who is the inside man for the heist. Erin informs him that the crime has been moved forward to today, and David thinks it's impossible. Erin says that it's the only way for the two of them to be together, and he agrees to help the team rob the bank ahead of schedule. Tyrone dispatches the Quarres to the airfield where they are to prepare a small plane for their escape to the Caribbean. He assigns Erin to stay at the house and guard Friar. She points out that David will expect to see her at the bank, but Tyrone insists that he can handle David. Tyrone and Hoop leave for the bank. Alone in the house together, Erin appears extremely sympathetic to Friar's plight. She explains that if she let him go, Tyrone would kill her. She shows Friar her right foot which is missing the second toe, claiming that Tyrone cut it off when she tried to leave him. At the bank, Hoop infiltrates the electrical system and causes a total blackout, leaving only the phone lines open. Tyrone impersonates a blind man making a $10 million transfer out of the bank, insisting that the transfer absolutely must happen by 6:00 PM. During the blackout, he uses David as a foil against the bank manager, pretending to be outraged that his transfer cannot go through. David offers to make the transfer on his laptop through a modem, much to his manager's relief. The manager hands Tyrone a disc with all the various account numbers and passwords for the transfers, but as Tyrone pretends to miss it with his outstretched hand due to his blindness, David grabs the disc. As David walks Tyrone out of the bank, he insists that he must see Erin before he hands over the disc, despite this being a departure from the plan. Tyrone and Hoop decide to go to David's house and ambush him. Meanwhile, on Turk Street, the lack of food has made Friar pass out. Erin realizes he is a diabetic and tries to revive him by dripping orange juice into his mouth. Out of desperation, she grabs his keys and wallet and drives his car to his apartment, where she finds his insulin in the refrigerator. Back at the house, she injects Friar and saves him from falling into a diabetic coma. Friar thanks her for saving his life and says that he owes her one. Erin comments on the packed bags that she noticed at Friar's apartment, and she reveals that she brought his cello back with her. Erin sits at the piano and begins to play a halting version of Chopsticks, by the end, she is playing a sophisticated, jazzlike version of the piece, revealing that she is also a musician. She explains that Tyrone rescued her from a collapsing Russia, where most of her friends went on to become prostitutes. Pointing the gun at Friar, she says she'll collect the debt he owes her for saving his life by making him play with her. She gives him a copy of Henri Duparc's Chanson Triste, and he sight reads it with her accompanying on piano. Afterward, he sits behind her and teaches her to play the cello. The two almost kiss, but Friar decides against it. He clearly has fallen for Erin, but the extent is unclear. He allows her to tie him up again, presumably so she will not be killed by Tyrone. At David's house, Hoop gets nowhere by roughing up the poor banker. He has password-protected the contents of the disc, and he refuses to divulge the password unless he sees Erin. Hoop brings Erin to David's house, leaving Friar alone on Turk Street. David insists on being alone with Erin, who coyly tries to hew to the plan that she leave with Tyrone for the Caribbean, returning for David in a few days. He wants to go with them, but Erin points out that he can't be seen with Tyrone ever again, promising that she'll return for him. David says, ""Enough promises"", and the two of them make love for the first time. Hoop gets more and more agitated as time goes by, finally barging into the room. Enraged by the sight of Erin and David in bed, he kills David without getting the password. Erin correctly guesses that the password is her name, and the three of them get in a car together, where Tyrone reveals that they are not going to meet the Quarres at the airfield. Realizing her various escape plans were being cut off, Erin concocts a story that Friar was lying about looking for a girl and was in fact looking for Tyrone, convincing Tyrone that they must return to Turk Street and kill him. Friar has loosened his bonds, and when Hoop attempts to strangle him, Friar stabs him in the neck with a corkscrew, killing him. Tyrone puts a gun in Erin's hand, trying to make her pull the trigger as her 'baptism', when the Quarres burst in with guns. The couple realized that they were being abandoned and want their cut of the bank money. As Mr. Quarre tries to take the disc from Tyrone, his shotgun goes off, killing Mrs. Quarre. Mr. Quarre is heartbroken and kills himself with her pistol. Friar convinces Tyrone, who is clearly averse to shedding blood himself, that as a cop, he can help them with their escape plan. The crew will drive to Albany and then on to the Canadian border, and Friar asserts that with the siren in his car and his badge, he can help them get to the border without incident. He asks that Erin be allowed to choose her own path from there: whether to be with Friar or Tyrone. Tyrone agrees, riding in the back seat with a shotgun aimed at Friar's back. Tyrone reveals that the $10 million has been transferred into multiple banks around Albany in smaller amounts which won't attract the attention that the original sum would. The trio spend the morning going to the various banks withdrawing the funds in cashier's checks. In order to still have the advantage over Friar, Tyrone calls each bank in advance and convinces them to allow him to withdraw the funds at the drive-thru. At one of the banks, Friar says that a security guard has written down their license plate number, convincing Tyrone that they need to stop and steal some new ones. On the way to Canada, Erin slides into the backseat with Tyrone, signaling that she will choose him, but she slips a pistol to Friar in the front seat. At the Canadian border, as they wait in line behind the other cars, Friar insists that the time has come for Tyrone to let them go. He turns around with the pistol and Tyrone fires the shotgun. Friar has placed the old license plates behind his back, shielding him from the blast. As Tyrone runs for the border with the shotgun, he is gunned down by the border police. Friar has to choose whether or not to turn Erin in, since only he knows if she was a hostage or a conspirator. She reminds him of how they almost kissed and says that they've each got their $1 million share of the cashier's checks which they could use to run away together. Friar reveals that he has torn his up and allows her to walk away. As she is leaving the border station, he tells a cop to arrest her.

456959The narrator, Angus Scrimm, in his only words in the film, introduces the audience to the creatures called ""djinn"" with the following statement: {{quote}} The next scene is set in Persia during the year 1127 A. D. with the djinn asking a Persian emperor to make his second wish. The emperor asks the djinn to show him wonders. The djinn uses his powers to torture and mutilate people in the palace. Before the emperor can make his third wish, Zoroaster, a sorcerer , interrupts and states that upon the third wish granted to the one who woke the djinn, a gateway will open between the worlds and the evil race of djinn can live on Earth. The sorcerer then reveals a fire opal. The djinn is sucked into the jewel, where he remains captured. In present day America, Raymond Beaumont  is supervising workers as they lower a box containing an antique statue of Ahura Mazda onto a ship's deck. The worker who is lowering the crate is drinking on the job and accidentally drops it from his crane, killing Beaumont's assistant  and destroying the statue. It breaks open and a dockworker finds the fire opal inside, which he steals and pawns. The jewel ends up at Regal Auctioneers, where boss Nick Merritt  gives it to appraiser Alexandra Amberson to examine. Her examinations of the jewel wake the djinn. Thinking she saw something inside the jewel, Alexandra takes it to her labworker, best friend and potential love interest Josh Aickman  to analyze. Later, as he is collecting data, light reflections cause the gem to explode and the djinn is released. The lab is destroyed and Josh is killed, upon his wish for relief from his physical pain. Alex, thinking the gem has something to do with the explosion and subsequent death of Josh, tracks down Beaumont, to whom the statue belonged. Beaumont tells Alex to visit a folklore professor named Wendy Derleth  to find out more about Ahura Mazda and the gem. He also invites Alex and her sister Shannon  to a party he is hosting. The folklore professor tells Alex about the jewel, the djinn and its evil history. Later, Alex learns that the djinn needs to power the gem with the soul of humans and then grant her three wishes before he can unleash the djinn on Earth. During this time, the djinn, who had been in demonic form, removes the face of a corpse in the morgue, taking on the dead man's form and the name Nathaniel Demerest. The djinn, now Nathaniel, goes about granting people wishes in return for their souls while he searches for Alex. He finally tracks down Alex's boss and grants him a greed-inflicted wish so that he can get Alex's address. Alex is haunted by visions whenever the djinn grants a wish. She goes to Wendy Derleth's house to consult with her again, but Nathaniel has already killed her and taken her form. During their conversation, Alex realizes she is really talking to the djinn. He confronts her and asks her to make three wishes. He even gives her a ""test"" wish. She uses this wish and orders the djinn to kill itself. He complies by blowing his head off with a gun, yet the wound heals instantly; as the djinn is immortal, he cannot be killed. Alex then uses the first of the ""official"" three wishes: her first being to know her opponent, the djinn. He teleports her to his terrifying world within the gem, thus demonstrating his true nature to her. Next, she wishes herself back to her apartment, alone. The Djinn had been threatening Alex's sister, so Alex sets about finding Shannon. She races to Beaumont's party and Nathaniel follows. While talking to Nathaniel at the party, Beaumont makes the mistake of wishing his party would be unforgettable, and Nathaniel begins wreaking havoc by causing the art pieces to kill the guests. The djinn finally corners Alex and traps Shannon, trying to scare Alex into making the ultimate third wish. Alex wishes that the dockworker had not been drinking on the job two days ago undoing the events that followed  and trapping the Djinn in the opal. The dock scene is shown again and the now sober operator has no trouble lowering the crate containing Ahura Mazda. Alex goes to see Josh at the lab. He notices that Alex is strangely pleased with herself, but she will not say why. Back on the statue of Ahura Mazda, which is now in Beaumont's private collection, the camera zooms inside the jewel and shows us the djinn on a throne, waiting to be released.
4140604In the film, South African musicians, playwrights, poets and activists recall the struggle against apartheid from the 1940s to the 1990s that stripped black citizens of South Africa of basic human rights, and the important role that music played in that struggle. The documentary uses a mixture of interviews, musical performances and historical film footage. Among the South Africans who take part are Miriam Makeba, Abdullah Ibrahim, Hugh Masekela, Vusi Mahlasela and others. The freedom songs heard in the film have an important historical context. Particularly in the United States, freedom songs have referred to protest songs of the abolitionist, civil rights, and labor movements. Yet, in South Africa, the songs take on a different meaning, referring to a unique collection of songs tied to the struggle for racial equality during the twentieth century. Stylistically, freedom songs originated in choir as a unifying and prevalent genre that combined southern African signing traditions with Christian hymns. Most of the songs have simple melodies and are sung a cappella. More importantly, they are composed and sung in groups, and often reflect changing political circumstances and attitudes.Olwage, Grant.

He does this by using quick change artist Todoquisque disguised as Filemón. Nevertheless, there is one thing that Botijola did not count on. Bacterio has thwarted him by hiding the pieces of his invention in different historic moments, utilizing a time machine he built. Mortadelo and Filemón have fallen out and are working minor jobs in the city, which they manage to mess up. The pair are reunited to solve the case. They use Bacterio's time machine to go to ancient Rome, the Coliseum and after Filemon beats a giant gladiator, they pick up the first part, which is then stolen by Chulin who works for Botijola. They then go back to the Inquisition, meet Torquemados and set prisoners free before getting the second piece, also stolen by Chulin. They then go to Botijola's desert HQ to try and stop him, with mixed success till Ofelia steps in and cuts off gravity with another Bacterio invention. A large area of water has been dried up but thanks to Mortadelo, it is returned to the city instead of where it comes from and floods the city so much that many buildings are submerged.

129246The film opens in 1950 with Pu Yi's re-entry into the just-proclaimed People's Republic of China as a political prisoner and war criminal, having been captured by the Red Army when the Soviet Union entered the Pacific War in 1945  and been in their custody for the past five years. Puyi attempts suicide, which only renders him unconscious. In a flashback, apparently triggered as a dream, Puyi relives his first entry, with his wet nurse at his side, into the Forbidden City. The next section of the film is a series of chronological flashbacks showing Puyi's early life: from his royal upbringing, to the tumultuous period of the early Chinese Republic, to his subsequent exile, his Japanese-supported puppet reign of Manchukuo, and then his capture by the Soviet army — all of which are intermixed with flash-forwards portraying his prison life. Under the “Communist re-education program” for political prisoners, Puyi is coerced by his interrogators to formally renounce his forced collaboration with the Imperial Japanese invaders for war crimes during their occupation of China during the war. Finally, after a heated discussion with the camp commandant and upon watching a propaganda film detailing the wartime atrocities committed by the Japanese, Puyi recants his previous stance and is set free and rehabilitated by the government in 1958. The concluding section of the film ends with a flash-forward to the mid-1960s during the Mao cult and the beginning of the Cultural Revolution. By now, Puyi has become a simple gardener who lives a peasant proletarian existence. On his way home from work, he happens upon a Red Guard parade, complete with children playing pentatonic music on accordions en masse and dancers who dance the rejection of landlordism by the Communists. His prison camp commander, his only friend during his incarceration, is forced to wear a dunce cap and a sandwich board bearing punitive slogans, and is one of the political prisoners now punished as an anti-revolutionary in the parade. Puyi later visits the Forbidden City as an ordinary tourist. There he meets an assertive little boy wearing the red scarf of the Pioneer Movement. The young Communist orders Puyi to step away from the throne. However, Puyi proves to the boy that he is indeed the Son of Heaven, proceeding to approach the throne. There, Puyi discovers the 60 year old pet cricket he kept as a child and gives it to the child. Amazed by the gift, the boy turns to talk to Puyi, but the emperor has disappeared. The film ends with a tour guide leading a tour in front of the throne, where the guide sums up Puyi's life in a few, brief sentences, concluding that he died in 1967.

3912910As people are enjoying drinks in a bar, a man covered in blood - identified onscreen as ""Hero""  - enters through the door and warns them all of impending danger. No one heeds his warning, so he shows the bar patrons the head of a repulsive creature to make them take him seriously. He is soon pulled through a window and decapitated by one of the monsters, amusingly just after it was implied that his chances of survival were very high. After the carnage, a woman - ""Heroine""  - bursts through the door and reveals herself to be the recently deceased man's wife. After a brief sentimental moment between the wife and her late husband, they begin boarding up the windows in the bar. Despite their efforts, a young monster bursts through an uncovered window and begins decapitating the people inside the bar. It dismembers one of the women - ""Harley Mom""  - and it is initially assumed that she died from massive blood loss. The monster disappears for some time, then is found attempting to sexually penetrate one of the deer heads nailed to the wall. A shotgun blast removes the deer head and monster from the wall. The monster drops into a freezer which is then sealed shut, trapping it inside. Following this, the remaining windows are boarded up and the bar patrons are given a moment of peace. Trying to call for help, they learn that the only phone in the bar has been hit by a stray shotgun blast and has been rendered useless. After a short breather, one of the women - ""Tuffy""  - suddenly realizes that her son is still upstairs and runs to get him. Once she finds her child the group rejoices until the boy is pulled through a window and eaten by one of the monsters, leaving only his sneaker behind. Tuffy is now incapacitated by grief, and the monster then vomits a stream of slime at one of the group - ""Beer Guy"" . As the remaining people regroup downstairs, they realize that the slime has a decomposing effect and that the victim is being slowly overcome by its effects. The group kills the young monster in the freezer and hangs it outside. The monster's parents quickly have sex and produce two offspring in a matter of seconds, all of whom begin to attack the pub with renewed fury. Meanwhile, one of the women - ""Honey Pie"" ([[Jenny Wade  - begins washing off the blood and has to take off her clothes, much to the amusement of the others. The patrons regroup and enact various attempts to escape or drive off the monsters, all of which lead to more casualties, including the accidental death of the Heroine at the hands of another character . Driven by rage over the death of her child, Tuffy aggressively takes charge of the remaining survivors, which results in the audience seeing her nickname change from ""Tuffy"" to ""Heroine 2"". ""Honey Pie"" successfully makes it to a truck, giving the other characters brief cause for hope . After many attacks and ultimately, a fight to the death between the last remaining humans and monsters, only four people survive the ordeal: Bozo, Hot Wheels, Tuffy , and Honey Pie. One person - ""Grandma""  - seems to survive but is seen being attacked by one of the remaining monsters at the end of the film.
3681139The Texas State University Fightin' Armadillos were once one of the most powerful teams in college football. However, shortly after winning consecutive national championships, massive NCAA violations resulted in the program having to forfeit several years' worth of victories. All of the previous players and coaches are banned from returning except Charlie Banks, the only ""clean"" player, who never got to play despite having ""heart"". The new coaching staff, led by Ed ""Straight Arrow"" Gennero , has nothing to assist them in building the team as no athletic scholarships are available, forcing them to hold tryouts. Along with this, they must worry about Dean Elias , who wants the team to fail so he can scrap it. However, the coaches soon have a makeshift team in place. Only 17 players are allowed on the team--not enough to have offense and defense--due to Dean Elias declaring many prospective players ineligible, so they are forced to play ironman football. The team lacks experience and talent in all areas, especially at quarterback, placekicker, and the defensive line. Assistant coach Wally ""Rig"" Riggendorf  recruits a 34 year old former high school star Paul Blake , who never attended college due to his father's death. Rig convinces him to enroll and play for the team. Blake arrives on campus and catches everyone's attention due to his age, especially Professor Carter . Paul then recruits a graduate student teaching assistant named Andre Krimm , who is also enrolled at the school and eligible to play for the team. Blake convinces him to join, and he is positioned on the defensive line, where he excelled years earlier. Even with the new members, the team continues to lose games. Things get so bad that, at one point during the film, announcer Chuck Neiderman  covers his microphone with his hands and screams, ""SHIT!!!!"" at the top of his lungs. Professor Carter tells Blake that she knows him from years earlier. Carter's ex-boyfriend was a high school football star, but Blake and his team humiliated him and his team in a championship game. This episode actually caused Carter to become infatuated with Blake. Now, years after the fact, the two begin a romantic relationship, which Dean Elias opposes, due to the fact that Blake is a student, and Carter is a teacher. Coach Rig makes one more recruiting move to secure a kicker. He shocks everybody by selecting Lucy Draper  from the school's soccer team. When she is brought on board, the team has its first taste of success, as Draper kicks a field goal in a driving rainstorm to forge a 3-3 tie with Kansas . After this game, Blake quits the team after arguments with the head coach  and Professor Carter, but convinces himself to come back after a teammate, who is also quitting, inadvertently changes his mind and both come back. With the coaches and players now on the same page, the team plays their last game of the season against the number one ranked team in the country, the University of Texas Colts, with whom the Armadillos were involved in a barroom brawl earlier in the season. They head into the game as huge underdogs, and without Coach Gennero, who is hospitalized just prior to the game, leaving Coach Rig in charge. After a horrible first half, they come back in the second half to make it a one point game with a few seconds left, and Gennero returns to the sideline, having only suffered from indigestion, though he lets Coach Rig call the final play.

His neighbor arrives and begs him to retrieve her daughter, who has been staying with her disreputable boyfriend on Turk Street. Friar protests that he is just a grand theft auto cop, and she needs to report the case to missing persons. He is packed and ready to go to a fantasy music camp in the Berkshires for two weeks, but he gives in to the neighbor's pleas and agrees to search for her daughter. On Turk Street, Friar shows the picture of the boyfriend to several people with no luck. As it begins to rain, he notices an elderly woman, Mrs. Quarre , who slips on her porch steps as she's carrying groceries. He runs to help her, and once inside, he meets her husband Thomas , and they make Friar a cup of tea. As they are sitting in the living room, Friar explains who he is looking for and reaches for the picture in order to show it to the Quarres. However, it blew away as he helped Mrs. Quarre with the groceries, and as he fumbles for it, Hoop  emerges and points a gun to his head. Friar is tied to a chair and a criminal plot quickly emerges, although the nature of it and the roles of the people in the house are unclear. The Quarres seem to be innocent quasi-hostages, much like himself. Hoop appears to be the near psychotic muscle man. The femme fatale is revealed to be a woman named Erin  who is involved with the ringleader Tyrone . When Tyrone is in the garden at one point, Erin and Hoop talk about running away together after their crime has been committed. The doorbell rings and it is a banker named David , who is the inside man for the heist. Erin informs him that the crime has been moved forward to today, and David thinks it's impossible. Erin says that it's the only way for the two of them to be together, and he agrees to help the team rob the bank ahead of schedule. Tyrone dispatches the Quarres to the airfield where they are to prepare a small plane for their escape to the Caribbean. He assigns Erin to stay at the house and guard Friar. She points out that David will expect to see her at the bank, but Tyrone insists that he can handle David. Tyrone and Hoop leave for the bank. Alone in the house together, Erin appears extremely sympathetic to Friar's plight. She explains that if she let him go, Tyrone would kill her. She shows Friar her right foot which is missing the second toe, claiming that Tyrone cut it off when she tried to leave him. At the bank, Hoop infiltrates the electrical system and causes a total blackout, leaving only the phone lines open. Tyrone impersonates a blind man making a $10 million transfer out of the bank, insisting that the transfer absolutely must happen by 6:00 PM. During the blackout, he uses David as a foil against the bank manager, pretending to be outraged that his transfer cannot go through. David offers to make the transfer on his laptop through a modem, much to his manager's relief. The manager hands Tyrone a disc with all the various account numbers and passwords for the transfers, but as Tyrone pretends to miss it with his outstretched hand due to his blindness, David grabs the disc. As David walks Tyrone out of the bank, he insists that he must see Erin before he hands over the disc, despite this being a departure from the plan. Tyrone and Hoop decide to go to David's house and ambush him. Meanwhile, on Turk Street, the lack of food has made Friar pass out. Erin realizes he is a diabetic and tries to revive him by dripping orange juice into his mouth. Out of desperation, she grabs his keys and wallet and drives his car to his apartment, where she finds his insulin in the refrigerator. Back at the house, she injects Friar and saves him from falling into a diabetic coma. Friar thanks her for saving his life and says that he owes her one. Erin comments on the packed bags that she noticed at Friar's apartment, and she reveals that she brought his cello back with her. Erin sits at the piano and begins to play a halting version of Chopsticks, by the end, she is playing a sophisticated, jazzlike version of the piece, revealing that she is also a musician. She explains that Tyrone rescued her from a collapsing Russia, where most of her friends went on to become prostitutes. Pointing the gun at Friar, she says she'll collect the debt he owes her for saving his life by making him play with her. She gives him a copy of Henri Duparc's Chanson Triste, and he sight reads it with her accompanying on piano. Afterward, he sits behind her and teaches her to play the cello. The two almost kiss, but Friar decides against it. He clearly has fallen for Erin, but the extent is unclear. He allows her to tie him up again, presumably so she will not be killed by Tyrone. At David's house, Hoop gets nowhere by roughing up the poor banker. He has password-protected the contents of the disc, and he refuses to divulge the password unless he sees Erin. Hoop brings Erin to David's house, leaving Friar alone on Turk Street. David insists on being alone with Erin, who coyly tries to hew to the plan that she leave with Tyrone for the Caribbean, returning for David in a few days. He wants to go with them, but Erin points out that he can't be seen with Tyrone ever again, promising that she'll return for him. David says, ""Enough promises"", and the two of them make love for the first time. Hoop gets more and more agitated as time goes by, finally barging into the room. Enraged by the sight of Erin and David in bed, he kills David without getting the password. Erin correctly guesses that the password is her name, and the three of them get in a car together, where Tyrone reveals that they are not going to meet the Quarres at the airfield. Realizing her various escape plans were being cut off, Erin concocts a story that Friar was lying about looking for a girl and was in fact looking for Tyrone, convincing Tyrone that they must return to Turk Street and kill him. Friar has loosened his bonds, and when Hoop attempts to strangle him, Friar stabs him in the neck with a corkscrew, killing him. Tyrone puts a gun in Erin's hand, trying to make her pull the trigger as her 'baptism', when the Quarres burst in with guns. The couple realized that they were being abandoned and want their cut of the bank money. As Mr. Quarre tries to take the disc from Tyrone, his shotgun goes off, killing Mrs. Quarre. Mr. Quarre is heartbroken and kills himself with her pistol. Friar convinces Tyrone, who is clearly averse to shedding blood himself, that as a cop, he can help them with their escape plan. The crew will drive to Albany and then on to the Canadian border, and Friar asserts that with the siren in his car and his badge, he can help them get to the border without incident. He asks that Erin be allowed to choose her own path from there: whether to be with Friar or Tyrone. Tyrone agrees, riding in the back seat with a shotgun aimed at Friar's back. Tyrone reveals that the $10 million has been transferred into multiple banks around Albany in smaller amounts which won't attract the attention that the original sum would. The trio spend the morning going to the various banks withdrawing the funds in cashier's checks. In order to still have the advantage over Friar, Tyrone calls each bank in advance and convinces them to allow him to withdraw the funds at the drive-thru. At one of the banks, Friar says that a security guard has written down their license plate number, convincing Tyrone that they need to stop and steal some new ones. On the way to Canada, Erin slides into the backseat with Tyrone, signaling that she will choose him, but she slips a pistol to Friar in the front seat. At the Canadian border, as they wait in line behind the other cars, Friar insists that the time has come for Tyrone to let them go. He turns around with the pistol and Tyrone fires the shotgun. Friar has placed the old license plates behind his back, shielding him from the blast. As Tyrone runs for the border with the shotgun, he is gunned down by the border police. Friar has to choose whether or not to turn Erin in, since only he knows if she was a hostage or a conspirator. She reminds him of how they almost kissed and says that they've each got their $1 million share of the cashier's checks which they could use to run away together. Friar reveals that he has torn his up and allows her to walk away. As she is leaving the border station, he tells a cop to arrest her.

456959The narrator, Angus Scrimm, in his only words in the film, introduces the audience to the creatures called ""djinn"" with the following statement: {{quote}} The next scene is set in Persia during the year 1127 A. D. with the djinn asking a Persian emperor to make his second wish. The emperor asks the djinn to show him wonders. The djinn uses his powers to torture and mutilate people in the palace. Before the emperor can make his third wish, Zoroaster, a sorcerer , interrupts and states that upon the third wish granted to the one who woke the djinn, a gateway will open between the worlds and the evil race of djinn can live on Earth. The sorcerer then reveals a fire opal. The djinn is sucked into the jewel, where he remains captured. In present day America, Raymond Beaumont  is supervising workers as they lower a box containing an antique statue of Ahura Mazda onto a ship's deck. The worker who is lowering the crate is drinking on the job and accidentally drops it from his crane, killing Beaumont's assistant  and destroying the statue. It breaks open and a dockworker finds the fire opal inside, which he steals and pawns. The jewel ends up at Regal Auctioneers, where boss Nick Merritt  gives it to appraiser Alexandra Amberson to examine. Her examinations of the jewel wake the djinn. Thinking she saw something inside the jewel, Alexandra takes it to her labworker, best friend and potential love interest Josh Aickman  to analyze. Later, as he is collecting data, light reflections cause the gem to explode and the djinn is released. The lab is destroyed and Josh is killed, upon his wish for relief from his physical pain. Alex, thinking the gem has something to do with the explosion and subsequent death of Josh, tracks down Beaumont, to whom the statue belonged. Beaumont tells Alex to visit a folklore professor named Wendy Derleth  to find out more about Ahura Mazda and the gem. He also invites Alex and her sister Shannon  to a party he is hosting. The folklore professor tells Alex about the jewel, the djinn and its evil history. Later, Alex learns that the djinn needs to power the gem with the soul of humans and then grant her three wishes before he can unleash the djinn on Earth. During this time, the djinn, who had been in demonic form, removes the face of a corpse in the morgue, taking on the dead man's form and the name Nathaniel Demerest. The djinn, now Nathaniel, goes about granting people wishes in return for their souls while he searches for Alex. He finally tracks down Alex's boss and grants him a greed-inflicted wish so that he can get Alex's address. Alex is haunted by visions whenever the djinn grants a wish. She goes to Wendy Derleth's house to consult with her again, but Nathaniel has already killed her and taken her form. During their conversation, Alex realizes she is really talking to the djinn. He confronts her and asks her to make three wishes. He even gives her a ""test"" wish. She uses this wish and orders the djinn to kill itself. He complies by blowing his head off with a gun, yet the wound heals instantly; as the djinn is immortal, he cannot be killed. Alex then uses the first of the ""official"" three wishes: her first being to know her opponent, the djinn. He teleports her to his terrifying world within the gem, thus demonstrating his true nature to her. Next, she wishes herself back to her apartment, alone. The Djinn had been threatening Alex's sister, so Alex sets about finding Shannon. She races to Beaumont's party and Nathaniel follows. While talking to Nathaniel at the party, Beaumont makes the mistake of wishing his party would be unforgettable, and Nathaniel begins wreaking havoc by causing the art pieces to kill the guests. The djinn finally corners Alex and traps Shannon, trying to scare Alex into making the ultimate third wish. Alex wishes that the dockworker had not been drinking on the job two days ago undoing the events that followed  and trapping the Djinn in the opal. The dock scene is shown again and the now sober operator has no trouble lowering the crate containing Ahura Mazda. Alex goes to see Josh at the lab. He notices that Alex is strangely pleased with herself, but she will not say why. Back on the statue of Ahura Mazda, which is now in Beaumont's private collection, the camera zooms inside the jewel and shows us the djinn on a throne, waiting to be released.
4140604In the film, South African musicians, playwrights, poets and activists recall the struggle against apartheid from the 1940s to the 1990s that stripped black citizens of South Africa of basic human rights, and the important role that music played in that struggle. The documentary uses a mixture of interviews, musical performances and historical film footage. Among the South Africans who take part are Miriam Makeba, Abdullah Ibrahim, Hugh Masekela, Vusi Mahlasela and others. The freedom songs heard in the film have an important historical context. Particularly in the United States, freedom songs have referred to protest songs of the abolitionist, civil rights, and labor movements. Yet, in South Africa, the songs take on a different meaning, referring to a unique collection of songs tied to the struggle for racial equality during the twentieth century. Stylistically, freedom songs originated in choir as a unifying and prevalent genre that combined southern African signing traditions with Christian hymns. Most of the songs have simple melodies and are sung a cappella. More importantly, they are composed and sung in groups, and often reflect changing political circumstances and attitudes.Olwage, Grant.

129246The film opens in 1950 with Pu Yi's re-entry into the just-proclaimed People's Republic of China as a political prisoner and war criminal, having been captured by the Red Army when the Soviet Union entered the Pacific War in 1945  and been in their custody for the past five years. Puyi attempts suicide, which only renders him unconscious. In a flashback, apparently triggered as a dream, Puyi relives his first entry, with his wet nurse at his side, into the Forbidden City. The next section of the film is a series of chronological flashbacks showing Puyi's early life: from his royal upbringing, to the tumultuous period of the early Chinese Republic, to his subsequent exile, his Japanese-supported puppet reign of Manchukuo, and then his capture by the Soviet army — all of which are intermixed with flash-forwards portraying his prison life. Under the “Communist re-education program” for political prisoners, Puyi is coerced by his interrogators to formally renounce his forced collaboration with the Imperial Japanese invaders for war crimes during their occupation of China during the war. Finally, after a heated discussion with the camp commandant and upon watching a propaganda film detailing the wartime atrocities committed by the Japanese, Puyi recants his previous stance and is set free and rehabilitated by the government in 1958. The concluding section of the film ends with a flash-forward to the mid-1960s during the Mao cult and the beginning of the Cultural Revolution. By now, Puyi has become a simple gardener who lives a peasant proletarian existence. On his way home from work, he happens upon a Red Guard parade, complete with children playing pentatonic music on accordions en masse and dancers who dance the rejection of landlordism by the Communists. His prison camp commander, his only friend during his incarceration, is forced to wear a dunce cap and a sandwich board bearing punitive slogans, and is one of the political prisoners now punished as an anti-revolutionary in the parade. Puyi later visits the Forbidden City as an ordinary tourist. There he meets an assertive little boy wearing the red scarf of the Pioneer Movement. The young Communist orders Puyi to step away from the throne. However, Puyi proves to the boy that he is indeed the Son of Heaven, proceeding to approach the throne.

3912910As people are enjoying drinks in a bar, a man covered in blood - identified onscreen as ""Hero""  - enters through the door and warns them all of impending danger. No one heeds his warning, so he shows the bar patrons the head of a repulsive creature to make them take him seriously. He is soon pulled through a window and decapitated by one of the monsters, amusingly just after it was implied that his chances of survival were very high. After the carnage, a woman - ""Heroine""  - bursts through the door and reveals herself to be the recently deceased man's wife. After a brief sentimental moment between the wife and her late husband, they begin boarding up the windows in the bar. Despite their efforts, a young monster bursts through an uncovered window and begins decapitating the people inside the bar. It dismembers one of the women - ""Harley Mom""  - and it is initially assumed that she died from massive blood loss. The monster disappears for some time, then is found attempting to sexually penetrate one of the deer heads nailed to the wall. A shotgun blast removes the deer head and monster from the wall. The monster drops into a freezer which is then sealed shut, trapping it inside. Following this, the remaining windows are boarded up and the bar patrons are given a moment of peace. Trying to call for help, they learn that the only phone in the bar has been hit by a stray shotgun blast and has been rendered useless. After a short breather, one of the women - ""Tuffy""  - suddenly realizes that her son is still upstairs and runs to get him. Once she finds her child the group rejoices until the boy is pulled through a window and eaten by one of the monsters, leaving only his sneaker behind. Tuffy is now incapacitated by grief, and the monster then vomits a stream of slime at one of the group - ""Beer Guy"" . As the remaining people regroup downstairs, they realize that the slime has a decomposing effect and that the victim is being slowly overcome by its effects. The group kills the young monster in the freezer and hangs it outside. The monster's parents quickly have sex and produce two offspring in a matter of seconds, all of whom begin to attack the pub with renewed fury. Meanwhile, one of the women - ""Honey Pie"" ([[Jenny Wade  - begins washing off the blood and has to take off her clothes, much to the amusement of the others. The patrons regroup and enact various attempts to escape or drive off the monsters, all of which lead to more casualties, including the accidental death of the Heroine at the hands of another character . Driven by rage over the death of her child, Tuffy aggressively takes charge of the remaining survivors, which results in the audience seeing her nickname change from ""Tuffy"" to ""Heroine 2"". ""Honey Pie"" successfully makes it to a truck, giving the other characters brief cause for hope . After many attacks and ultimately, a fight to the death between the last remaining humans and monsters, only four people survive the ordeal: Bozo, Hot Wheels, Tuffy , and Honey Pie. One person - ""Grandma""  - seems to survive but is seen being attacked by one of the remaining monsters at the end of the film.
3681139The Texas State University Fightin' Armadillos were once one of the most powerful teams in college football. However, shortly after winning consecutive national championships, massive NCAA violations resulted in the program having to forfeit several years' worth of victories. All of the previous players and coaches are banned from returning except Charlie Banks, the only ""clean"" player, who never got to play despite having ""heart"". The new coaching staff, led by Ed ""Straight Arrow"" Gennero , has nothing to assist them in building the team as no athletic scholarships are available, forcing them to hold tryouts. Along with this, they must worry about Dean Elias , who wants the team to fail so he can scrap it. However, the coaches soon have a makeshift team in place. Only 17 players are allowed on the team--not enough to have offense and defense--due to Dean Elias declaring many prospective players ineligible, so they are forced to play ironman football. The team lacks experience and talent in all areas, especially at quarterback, placekicker, and the defensive line. Assistant coach Wally ""Rig"" Riggendorf  recruits a 34 year old former high school star Paul Blake , who never attended college due to his father's death. Rig convinces him to enroll and play for the team. Blake arrives on campus and catches everyone's attention due to his age, especially Professor Carter . Paul then recruits a graduate student teaching assistant named Andre Krimm , who is also enrolled at the school and eligible to play for the team. Blake convinces him to join, and he is positioned on the defensive line, where he excelled years earlier. Even with the new members, the team continues to lose games. Things get so bad that, at one point during the film, announcer Chuck Neiderman  covers his microphone with his hands and screams, ""SHIT!!!!"" at the top of his lungs. Professor Carter tells Blake that she knows him from years earlier. Carter's ex-boyfriend was a high school football star, but Blake and his team humiliated him and his team in a championship game. This episode actually caused Carter to become infatuated with Blake. Now, years after the fact, the two begin a romantic relationship, which Dean Elias opposes, due to the fact that Blake is a student, and Carter is a teacher. Coach Rig makes one more recruiting move to secure a kicker. He shocks everybody by selecting Lucy Draper  from the school's soccer team. When she is brought on board, the team has its first taste of success, as Draper kicks a field goal in a driving rainstorm to forge a 3-3 tie with Kansas . After this game, Blake quits the team after arguments with the head coach  and Professor Carter, but convinces himself to come back after a teammate, who is also quitting, inadvertently changes his mind and both come back. With the coaches and players now on the same page, the team plays their last game of the season against the number one ranked team in the country, the University of Texas Colts, with whom the Armadillos were involved in a barroom brawl earlier in the season. They head into the game as huge underdogs, and without Coach Gennero, who is hospitalized just prior to the game, leaving Coach Rig in charge. After a horrible first half, they come back in the second half to make it a one point game with a few seconds left, and Gennero returns to the sideline, having only suffered from indigestion, though he lets Coach Rig call the final play. The team decides to try to win it all with a two-point conversion. They fake a point after attempt and pass for two. Blake scrambles and finally finds Banks in the end zone to win the game.
2762659{{plot}} Over the opening credits, police detective Jack Friar  is shown practicing Johannes Brahms' Trio #1 in B Major, Op.8 and injecting himself with insulin. His neighbor arrives and begs him to retrieve her daughter, who has been staying with her disreputable boyfriend on Turk Street. Friar protests that he is just a grand theft auto cop, and she needs to report the case to missing persons. He is packed and ready to go to a fantasy music camp in the Berkshires for two weeks, but he gives in to the neighbor's pleas and agrees to search for her daughter. On Turk Street, Friar shows the picture of the boyfriend to several people with no luck. As it begins to rain, he notices an elderly woman, Mrs. Quarre , who slips on her porch steps as she's carrying groceries. He runs to help her, and once inside, he meets her husband Thomas , and they make Friar a cup of tea. As they are sitting in the living room, Friar explains who he is looking for and reaches for the picture in order to show it to the Quarres. However, it blew away as he helped Mrs. Quarre with the groceries, and as he fumbles for it, Hoop  emerges and points a gun to his head. Friar is tied to a chair and a criminal plot quickly emerges, although the nature of it and the roles of the people in the house are unclear. The Quarres seem to be innocent quasi-hostages, much like himself. Hoop appears to be the near psychotic muscle man. The femme fatale is revealed to be a woman named Erin  who is involved with the ringleader Tyrone . When Tyrone is in the garden at one point, Erin and Hoop talk about running away together after their crime has been committed. The doorbell rings and it is a banker named David , who is the inside man for the heist. Erin informs him that the crime has been moved forward to today, and David thinks it's impossible. Erin says that it's the only way for the two of them to be together, and he agrees to help the team rob the bank ahead of schedule. Tyrone dispatches the Quarres to the airfield where they are to prepare a small plane for their escape to the Caribbean. He assigns Erin to stay at the house and guard Friar. She points out that David will expect to see her at the bank, but Tyrone insists that he can handle David. Tyrone and Hoop leave for the bank. Alone in the house together, Erin appears extremely sympathetic to Friar's plight. She explains that if she let him go, Tyrone would kill her. She shows Friar her right foot which is missing the second toe, claiming that Tyrone cut it off when she tried to leave him. At the bank, Hoop infiltrates the electrical system and causes a total blackout, leaving only the phone lines open. Tyrone impersonates a blind man making a $10 million transfer out of the bank, insisting that the transfer absolutely must happen by 6:00 PM. During the blackout, he uses David as a foil against the bank manager, pretending to be outraged that his transfer cannot go through. David offers to make the transfer on his laptop through a modem, much to his manager's relief. The manager hands Tyrone a disc with all the various account numbers and passwords for the transfers, but as Tyrone pretends to miss it with his outstretched hand due to his blindness, David grabs the disc. As David walks Tyrone out of the bank, he insists that he must see Erin before he hands over the disc, despite this being a departure from the plan. Tyrone and Hoop decide to go to David's house and ambush him. Meanwhile, on Turk Street, the lack of food has made Friar pass out. Erin realizes he is a diabetic and tries to revive him by dripping orange juice into his mouth. Out of desperation, she grabs his keys and wallet and drives his car to his apartment, where she finds his insulin in the refrigerator. Back at the house, she injects Friar and saves him from falling into a diabetic coma. Friar thanks her for saving his life and says that he owes her one. Erin comments on the packed bags that she noticed at Friar's apartment, and she reveals that she brought his cello back with her. Erin sits at the piano and begins to play a halting version of Chopsticks, by the end, she is playing a sophisticated, jazzlike version of the piece, revealing that she is also a musician. She explains that Tyrone rescued her from a collapsing Russia, where most of her friends went on to become prostitutes. Pointing the gun at Friar, she says she'll collect the debt he owes her for saving his life by making him play with her. She gives him a copy of Henri Duparc's Chanson Triste, and he sight reads it with her accompanying on piano. Afterward, he sits behind her and teaches her to play the cello. The two almost kiss, but Friar decides against it. He clearly has fallen for Erin, but the extent is unclear. He allows her to tie him up again, presumably so she will not be killed by Tyrone. At David's house, Hoop gets nowhere by roughing up the poor banker. He has password-protected the contents of the disc, and he refuses to divulge the password unless he sees Erin. Hoop brings Erin to David's house, leaving Friar alone on Turk Street. David insists on being alone with Erin, who coyly tries to hew to the plan that she leave with Tyrone for the Caribbean, returning for David in a few days. He wants to go with them, but Erin points out that he can't be seen with Tyrone ever again, promising that she'll return for him. David says, ""Enough promises"", and the two of them make love for the first time. Hoop gets more and more agitated as time goes by, finally barging into the room. Enraged by the sight of Erin and David in bed, he kills David without getting the password. Erin correctly guesses that the password is her name, and the three of them get in a car together, where Tyrone reveals that they are not going to meet the Quarres at the airfield. Realizing her various escape plans were being cut off, Erin concocts a story that Friar was lying about looking for a girl and was in fact looking for Tyrone, convincing Tyrone that they must return to Turk Street and kill him. Friar has loosened his bonds, and when Hoop attempts to strangle him, Friar stabs him in the neck with a corkscrew, killing him. Tyrone puts a gun in Erin's hand, trying to make her pull the trigger as her 'baptism', when the Quarres burst in with guns. The couple realized that they were being abandoned and want their cut of the bank money. As Mr. Quarre tries to take the disc from Tyrone, his shotgun goes off, killing Mrs. Quarre. Mr. Quarre is heartbroken and kills himself with her pistol. Friar convinces Tyrone, who is clearly averse to shedding blood himself, that as a cop, he can help them with their escape plan. The crew will drive to Albany and then on to the Canadian border, and Friar asserts that with the siren in his car and his badge, he can help them get to the border without incident. He asks that Erin be allowed to choose her own path from there: whether to be with Friar or Tyrone. Tyrone agrees, riding in the back seat with a shotgun aimed at Friar's back. Tyrone reveals that the $10 million has been transferred into multiple banks around Albany in smaller amounts which won't attract the attention that the original sum would. The trio spend the morning going to the various banks withdrawing the funds in cashier's checks. In order to still have the advantage over Friar, Tyrone calls each bank in advance and convinces them to allow him to withdraw the funds at the drive-thru. At one of the banks, Friar says that a security guard has written down their license plate number, convincing Tyrone that they need to stop and steal some new ones. On the way to Canada, Erin slides into the backseat with Tyrone, signaling that she will choose him, but she slips a pistol to Friar in the front seat. At the Canadian border, as they wait in line behind the other cars, Friar insists that the time has come for Tyrone to let them go. He turns around with the pistol and Tyrone fires the shotgun. Friar has placed the old license plates behind his back, shielding him from the blast. As Tyrone runs for the border with the shotgun, he is gunned down by the border police. Friar has to choose whether or not to turn Erin in, since only he knows if she was a hostage or a conspirator. She reminds him of how they almost kissed and says that they've each got their $1 million share of the cashier's checks which they could use to run away together. Friar reveals that he has torn his up and allows her to walk away. As she is leaving the border station, he tells a cop to arrest her.

456959The narrator, Angus Scrimm, in his only words in the film, introduces the audience to the creatures called ""djinn"" with the following statement: {{quote}} The next scene is set in Persia during the year 1127 A. D. with the djinn asking a Persian emperor to make his second wish. The emperor asks the djinn to show him wonders. The djinn uses his powers to torture and mutilate people in the palace. Before the emperor can make his third wish, Zoroaster, a sorcerer , interrupts and states that upon the third wish granted to the one who woke the djinn, a gateway will open between the worlds and the evil race of djinn can live on Earth. The sorcerer then reveals a fire opal. The djinn is sucked into the jewel, where he remains captured. In present day America, Raymond Beaumont  is supervising workers as they lower a box containing an antique statue of Ahura Mazda onto a ship's deck. The worker who is lowering the crate is drinking on the job and accidentally drops it from his crane, killing Beaumont's assistant  and destroying the statue. It breaks open and a dockworker finds the fire opal inside, which he steals and pawns. The jewel ends up at Regal Auctioneers, where boss Nick Merritt  gives it to appraiser Alexandra Amberson to examine. Her examinations of the jewel wake the djinn. Thinking she saw something inside the jewel, Alexandra takes it to her labworker, best friend and potential love interest Josh Aickman  to analyze. Later, as he is collecting data, light reflections cause the gem to explode and the djinn is released. The lab is destroyed and Josh is killed, upon his wish for relief from his physical pain. Alex, thinking the gem has something to do with the explosion and subsequent death of Josh, tracks down Beaumont, to whom the statue belonged. Beaumont tells Alex to visit a folklore professor named Wendy Derleth  to find out more about Ahura Mazda and the gem. He also invites Alex and her sister Shannon  to a party he is hosting. The folklore professor tells Alex about the jewel, the djinn and its evil history. Later, Alex learns that the djinn needs to power the gem with the soul of humans and then grant her three wishes before he can unleash the djinn on Earth. During this time, the djinn, who had been in demonic form, removes the face of a corpse in the morgue, taking on the dead man's form and the name Nathaniel Demerest. The djinn, now Nathaniel, goes about granting people wishes in return for their souls while he searches for Alex. He finally tracks down Alex's boss and grants him a greed-inflicted wish so that he can get Alex's address. Alex is haunted by visions whenever the djinn grants a wish. She goes to Wendy Derleth's house to consult with her again, but Nathaniel has already killed her and taken her form. During their conversation, Alex realizes she is really talking to the djinn. He confronts her and asks her to make three wishes. He even gives her a ""test"" wish. She uses this wish and orders the djinn to kill itself. He complies by blowing his head off with a gun, yet the wound heals instantly; as the djinn is immortal, he cannot be killed. Alex then uses the first of the ""official"" three wishes: her first being to know her opponent, the djinn. He teleports her to his terrifying world within the gem, thus demonstrating his true nature to her. Next, she wishes herself back to her apartment, alone. The Djinn had been threatening Alex's sister, so Alex sets about finding Shannon. She races to Beaumont's party and Nathaniel follows. While talking to Nathaniel at the party, Beaumont makes the mistake of wishing his party would be unforgettable, and Nathaniel begins wreaking havoc by causing the art pieces to kill the guests. The djinn finally corners Alex and traps Shannon, trying to scare Alex into making the ultimate third wish. Alex wishes that the dockworker had not been drinking on the job two days ago undoing the events that followed  and trapping the Djinn in the opal. The dock scene is shown again and the now sober operator has no trouble lowering the crate containing Ahura Mazda. Alex goes to see Josh at the lab. He notices that Alex is strangely pleased with herself, but she will not say why. Back on the statue of Ahura Mazda, which is now in Beaumont's private collection, the camera zooms inside the jewel and shows us the djinn on a throne, waiting to be released.
4140604In the film, South African musicians, playwrights, poets and activists recall the struggle against apartheid from the 1940s to the 1990s that stripped black citizens of South Africa of basic human rights, and the important role that music played in that struggle. The documentary uses a mixture of interviews, musical performances and historical film footage. Among the South Africans who take part are Miriam Makeba, Abdullah Ibrahim, Hugh Masekela, Vusi Mahlasela and others. The freedom songs heard in the film have an important historical context. Particularly in the United States, freedom songs have referred to protest songs of the abolitionist, civil rights, and labor movements. Yet, in South Africa, the songs take on a different meaning, referring to a unique collection of songs tied to the struggle for racial equality during the twentieth century. Stylistically, freedom songs originated in choir as a unifying and prevalent genre that combined southern African signing traditions with Christian hymns. Most of the songs have simple melodies and are sung a cappella. More importantly, they are composed and sung in groups, and often reflect changing political circumstances and attitudes.Olwage, Grant.

129246The film opens in 1950 with Pu Yi's re-entry into the just-proclaimed People's Republic of China as a political prisoner and war criminal, having been captured by the Red Army when the Soviet Union entered the Pacific War in 1945  and been in their custody for the past five years. Puyi attempts suicide, which only renders him unconscious. In a flashback, apparently triggered as a dream, Puyi relives his first entry, with his wet nurse at his side, into the Forbidden City. The next section of the film is a series of chronological flashbacks showing Puyi's early life: from his royal upbringing, to the tumultuous period of the early Chinese Republic, to his subsequent exile, his Japanese-supported puppet reign of Manchukuo, and then his capture by the Soviet army — all of which are intermixed with flash-forwards portraying his prison life. Under the “Communist re-education program” for political prisoners, Puyi is coerced by his interrogators to formally renounce his forced collaboration with the Imperial Japanese invaders for war crimes during their occupation of China during the war. Finally, after a heated discussion with the camp commandant and upon watching a propaganda film detailing the wartime atrocities committed by the Japanese, Puyi recants his previous stance and is set free and rehabilitated by the government in 1958. The concluding section of the film ends with a flash-forward to the mid-1960s during the Mao cult and the beginning of the Cultural Revolution. By now, Puyi has become a simple gardener who lives a peasant proletarian existence. On his way home from work, he happens upon a Red Guard parade, complete with children playing pentatonic music on accordions en masse and dancers who dance the rejection of landlordism by the Communists. His prison camp commander, his only friend during his incarceration, is forced to wear a dunce cap and a sandwich board bearing punitive slogans, and is one of the political prisoners now punished as an anti-revolutionary in the parade. Puyi later visits the Forbidden City as an ordinary tourist. There he meets an assertive little boy wearing the red scarf of the Pioneer Movement. The young Communist orders Puyi to step away from the throne. However, Puyi proves to the boy that he is indeed the Son of Heaven, proceeding to approach the throne. There, Puyi discovers the 60 year old pet cricket he kept as a child and gives it to the child. Amazed by the gift, the boy turns to talk to Puyi, but the emperor has disappeared. The film ends with a tour guide leading a tour in front of the throne, where the guide sums up Puyi's life in a few, brief sentences, concluding that he died in 1967.

3912910As people are enjoying drinks in a bar, a man covered in blood - identified onscreen as ""Hero""  - enters through the door and warns them all of impending danger. No one heeds his warning, so he shows the bar patrons the head of a repulsive creature to make them take him seriously. He is soon pulled through a window and decapitated by one of the monsters, amusingly just after it was implied that his chances of survival were very high. After the carnage, a woman - ""Heroine""  - bursts through the door and reveals herself to be the recently deceased man's wife. After a brief sentimental moment between the wife and her late husband, they begin boarding up the windows in the bar. Despite their efforts, a young monster bursts through an uncovered window and begins decapitating the people inside the bar. It dismembers one of the women - ""Harley Mom""  - and it is initially assumed that she died from massive blood loss. The monster disappears for some time, then is found attempting to sexually penetrate one of the deer heads nailed to the wall. A shotgun blast removes the deer head and monster from the wall. The monster drops into a freezer which is then sealed shut, trapping it inside. Following this, the remaining windows are boarded up and the bar patrons are given a moment of peace. Trying to call for help, they learn that the only phone in the bar has been hit by a stray shotgun blast and has been rendered useless. After a short breather, one of the women - ""Tuffy""  - suddenly realizes that her son is still upstairs and runs to get him. Once she finds her child the group rejoices until the boy is pulled through a window and eaten by one of the monsters, leaving only his sneaker behind. Tuffy is now incapacitated by grief, and the monster then vomits a stream of slime at one of the group - ""Beer Guy"" . As the remaining people regroup downstairs, they realize that the slime has a decomposing effect and that the victim is being slowly overcome by its effects. The group kills the young monster in the freezer and hangs it outside. The monster's parents quickly have sex and produce two offspring in a matter of seconds, all of whom begin to attack the pub with renewed fury. Meanwhile, one of the women - ""Honey Pie"" ([[Jenny Wade  - begins washing off the blood and has to take off her clothes, much to the amusement of the others. The patrons regroup and enact various attempts to escape or drive off the monsters, all of which lead to more casualties, including the accidental death of the Heroine at the hands of another character . Driven by rage over the death of her child, Tuffy aggressively takes charge of the remaining survivors, which results in the audience seeing her nickname change from ""Tuffy"" to ""Heroine 2"". ""Honey Pie"" successfully makes it to a truck, giving the other characters brief cause for hope . After many attacks and ultimately, a fight to the death between the last remaining humans and monsters, only four people survive the ordeal: Bozo, Hot Wheels, Tuffy , and Honey Pie. One person - ""Grandma""  - seems to survive but is seen being attacked by one of the remaining monsters at the end of the film.
3681139The Texas State University Fightin' Armadillos were once one of the most powerful teams in college football. However, shortly after winning consecutive national championships, massive NCAA violations resulted in the program having to forfeit several years' worth of victories. All of the previous players and coaches are banned from returning except Charlie Banks, the only ""clean"" player, who never got to play despite having ""heart"". The new coaching staff, led by Ed ""Straight Arrow"" Gennero , has nothing to assist them in building the team as no athletic scholarships are available, forcing them to hold tryouts. Along with this, they must worry about Dean Elias , who wants the team to fail so he can scrap it. However, the coaches soon have a makeshift team in place. Only 17 players are allowed on the team--not enough to have offense and defense--due to Dean Elias declaring many prospective players ineligible, so they are forced to play ironman football. The team lacks experience and talent in all areas, especially at quarterback, placekicker, and the defensive line. Assistant coach Wally ""Rig"" Riggendorf  recruits a 34 year old former high school star Paul Blake , who never attended college due to his father's death. Rig convinces him to enroll and play for the team. Blake arrives on campus and catches everyone's attention due to his age, especially Professor Carter . Paul then recruits a graduate student teaching assistant named Andre Krimm , who is also enrolled at the school and eligible to play for the team. Blake convinces him to join, and he is positioned on the defensive line, where he excelled years earlier. Even with the new members, the team continues to lose games. Things get so bad that, at one point during the film, announcer Chuck Neiderman  covers his microphone with his hands and screams, ""SHIT!!!!"" at the top of his lungs. Professor Carter tells Blake that she knows him from years earlier. Carter's ex-boyfriend was a high school football star, but Blake and his team humiliated him and his team in a championship game. This episode actually caused Carter to become infatuated with Blake. Now, years after the fact, the two begin a romantic relationship, which Dean Elias opposes, due to the fact that Blake is a student, and Carter is a teacher. Coach Rig makes one more recruiting move to secure a kicker. He shocks everybody by selecting Lucy Draper  from the school's soccer team. When she is brought on board, the team has its first taste of success, as Draper kicks a field goal in a driving rainstorm to forge a 3-3 tie with Kansas . After this game, Blake quits the team after arguments with the head coach  and Professor Carter, but convinces himself to come back after a teammate, who is also quitting, inadvertently changes his mind and both come back. With the coaches and players now on the same page, the team plays their last game of the season against the number one ranked team in the country, the University of Texas Colts, with whom the Armadillos were involved in a barroom brawl earlier in the season. They head into the game as huge underdogs, and without Coach Gennero, who is hospitalized just prior to the game, leaving Coach Rig in charge. After a horrible first half, they come back in the second half to make it a one point game with a few seconds left, and Gennero returns to the sideline, having only suffered from indigestion, though he lets Coach Rig call the final play. The team decides to try to win it all with a two-point conversion. They fake a point after attempt and pass for two. Blake scrambles and finally finds Banks in the end zone to win the game.
2762659{{plot}} Over the opening credits, police detective Jack Friar  is shown practicing Johannes Brahms' Trio #1 in B Major, Op.8 and injecting himself with insulin. His neighbor arrives and begs him to retrieve her daughter, who has been staying with her disreputable boyfriend on Turk Street. Friar protests that he is just a grand theft auto cop, and she needs to report the case to missing persons. He is packed and ready to go to a fantasy music camp in the Berkshires for two weeks, but he gives in to the neighbor's pleas and agrees to search for her daughter. On Turk Street, Friar shows the picture of the boyfriend to several people with no luck. As it begins to rain, he notices an elderly woman, Mrs. Quarre , who slips on her porch steps as she's carrying groceries. He runs to help her, and once inside, he meets her husband Thomas , and they make Friar a cup of tea. As they are sitting in the living room, Friar explains who he is looking for and reaches for the picture in order to show it to the Quarres. However, it blew away as he helped Mrs. Quarre with the groceries, and as he fumbles for it, Hoop  emerges and points a gun to his head. Friar is tied to a chair and a criminal plot quickly emerges, although the nature of it and the roles of the people in the house are unclear. The Quarres seem to be innocent quasi-hostages, much like himself. Hoop appears to be the near psychotic muscle man. The femme fatale is revealed to be a woman named Erin  who is involved with the ringleader Tyrone . When Tyrone is in the garden at one point, Erin and Hoop talk about running away together after their crime has been committed. The doorbell rings and it is a banker named David , who is the inside man for the heist. Erin informs him that the crime has been moved forward to today, and David thinks it's impossible. Erin says that it's the only way for the two of them to be together, and he agrees to help the team rob the bank ahead of schedule. Tyrone dispatches the Quarres to the airfield where they are to prepare a small plane for their escape to the Caribbean. He assigns Erin to stay at the house and guard Friar. She points out that David will expect to see her at the bank, but Tyrone insists that he can handle David. Tyrone and Hoop leave for the bank. Alone in the house together, Erin appears extremely sympathetic to Friar's plight. She explains that if she let him go, Tyrone would kill her. She shows Friar her right foot which is missing the second toe, claiming that Tyrone cut it off when she tried to leave him. At the bank, Hoop infiltrates the electrical system and causes a total blackout, leaving only the phone lines open. Tyrone impersonates a blind man making a $10 million transfer out of the bank, insisting that the transfer absolutely must happen by 6:00 PM. During the blackout, he uses David as a foil against the bank manager, pretending to be outraged that his transfer cannot go through. David offers to make the transfer on his laptop through a modem, much to his manager's relief. The manager hands Tyrone a disc with all the various account numbers and passwords for the transfers, but as Tyrone pretends to miss it with his outstretched hand due to his blindness, David grabs the disc. As David walks Tyrone out of the bank, he insists that he must see Erin before he hands over the disc, despite this being a departure from the plan. Tyrone and Hoop decide to go to David's house and ambush him. Meanwhile, on Turk Street, the lack of food has made Friar pass out. Erin realizes he is a diabetic and tries to revive him by dripping orange juice into his mouth. Out of desperation, she grabs his keys and wallet and drives his car to his apartment, where she finds his insulin in the refrigerator. Back at the house, she injects Friar and saves him from falling into a diabetic coma. Friar thanks her for saving his life and says that he owes her one. Erin comments on the packed bags that she noticed at Friar's apartment, and she reveals that she brought his cello back with her. Erin sits at the piano and begins to play a halting version of Chopsticks, by the end, she is playing a sophisticated, jazzlike version of the piece, revealing that she is also a musician. She explains that Tyrone rescued her from a collapsing Russia, where most of her friends went on to become prostitutes. Pointing the gun at Friar, she says she'll collect the debt he owes her for saving his life by making him play with her. She gives him a copy of Henri Duparc's Chanson Triste, and he sight reads it with her accompanying on piano. Afterward, he sits behind her and teaches her to play the cello. The two almost kiss, but Friar decides against it. He clearly has fallen for Erin, but the extent is unclear. He allows her to tie him up again, presumably so she will not be killed by Tyrone. At David's house, Hoop gets nowhere by roughing up the poor banker. He has password-protected the contents of the disc, and he refuses to divulge the password unless he sees Erin. Hoop brings Erin to David's house, leaving Friar alone on Turk Street. David insists on being alone with Erin, who coyly tries to hew to the plan that she leave with Tyrone for the Caribbean, returning for David in a few days. He wants to go with them, but Erin points out that he can't be seen with Tyrone ever again, promising that she'll return for him. David says, ""Enough promises"", and the two of them make love for the first time. Hoop gets more and more agitated as time goes by, finally barging into the room. Enraged by the sight of Erin and David in bed, he kills David without getting the password. Erin correctly guesses that the password is her name, and the three of them get in a car together, where Tyrone reveals that they are not going to meet the Quarres at the airfield. Realizing her various escape plans were being cut off, Erin concocts a story that Friar was lying about looking for a girl and was in fact looking for Tyrone, convincing Tyrone that they must return to Turk Street and kill him. Friar has loosened his bonds, and when Hoop attempts to strangle him, Friar stabs him in the neck with a corkscrew, killing him. Tyrone puts a gun in Erin's hand, trying to make her pull the trigger as her 'baptism', when the Quarres burst in with guns. The couple realized that they were being abandoned and want their cut of the bank money. As Mr. Quarre tries to take the disc from Tyrone, his shotgun goes off, killing Mrs. Quarre. Mr. Quarre is heartbroken and kills himself with her pistol. Friar convinces Tyrone, who is clearly averse to shedding blood himself, that as a cop, he can help them with their escape plan. The crew will drive to Albany and then on to the Canadian border, and Friar asserts that with the siren in his car and his badge, he can help them get to the border without incident. He asks that Erin be allowed to choose her own path from there: whether to be with Friar or Tyrone. Tyrone agrees, riding in the back seat with a shotgun aimed at Friar's back. Tyrone reveals that the $10 million has been transferred into multiple banks around Albany in smaller amounts which won't attract the attention that the original sum would. The trio spend the morning going to the various banks withdrawing the funds in cashier's checks. In order to still have the advantage over Friar, Tyrone calls each bank in advance and convinces them to allow him to withdraw the funds at the drive-thru. At one of the banks, Friar says that a security guard has written down their license plate number, convincing Tyrone that they need to stop and steal some new ones. On the way to Canada, Erin slides into the backseat with Tyrone, signaling that she will choose him, but she slips a pistol to Friar in the front seat. At the Canadian border, as they wait in line behind the other cars, Friar insists that the time has come for Tyrone to let them go. He turns around with the pistol and Tyrone fires the shotgun. Friar has placed the old license plates behind his back, shielding him from the blast. As Tyrone runs for the border with the shotgun, he is gunned down by the border police. Friar has to choose whether or not to turn Erin in, since only he knows if she was a hostage or a conspirator. She reminds him of how they almost kissed and says that they've each got their $1 million share of the cashier's checks which they could use to run away together. Friar reveals that he has torn his up and allows her to walk away. As she is leaving the border station, he tells a cop to arrest her.

The sorcerer then reveals a fire opal. The djinn is sucked into the jewel, where he remains captured. In present day America, Raymond Beaumont  is supervising workers as they lower a box containing an antique statue of Ahura Mazda onto a ship's deck. The worker who is lowering the crate is drinking on the job and accidentally drops it from his crane, killing Beaumont's assistant  and destroying the statue. It breaks open and a dockworker finds the fire opal inside, which he steals and pawns. The jewel ends up at Regal Auctioneers, where boss Nick Merritt  gives it to appraiser Alexandra Amberson to examine. Her examinations of the jewel wake the djinn. Thinking she saw something inside the jewel, Alexandra takes it to her labworker, best friend and potential love interest Josh Aickman  to analyze. Later, as he is collecting data, light reflections cause the gem to explode and the djinn is released. The lab is destroyed and Josh is killed, upon his wish for relief from his physical pain. Alex, thinking the gem has something to do with the explosion and subsequent death of Josh, tracks down Beaumont, to whom the statue belonged. Beaumont tells Alex to visit a folklore professor named Wendy Derleth  to find out more about Ahura Mazda and the gem. He also invites Alex and her sister Shannon  to a party he is hosting. The folklore professor tells Alex about the jewel, the djinn and its evil history. Later, Alex learns that the djinn needs to power the gem with the soul of humans and then grant her three wishes before he can unleash the djinn on Earth. During this time, the djinn, who had been in demonic form, removes the face of a corpse in the morgue, taking on the dead man's form and the name Nathaniel Demerest. The djinn, now Nathaniel, goes about granting people wishes in return for their souls while he searches for Alex. He finally tracks down Alex's boss and grants him a greed-inflicted wish so that he can get Alex's address. Alex is haunted by visions whenever the djinn grants a wish. She goes to Wendy Derleth's house to consult with her again, but Nathaniel has already killed her and taken her form. During their conversation, Alex realizes she is really talking to the djinn. He confronts her and asks her to make three wishes. He even gives her a ""test"" wish. She uses this wish and orders the djinn to kill itself. He complies by blowing his head off with a gun, yet the wound heals instantly; as the djinn is immortal, he cannot be killed. Alex then uses the first of the ""official"" three wishes: her first being to know her opponent, the djinn. He teleports her to his terrifying world within the gem, thus demonstrating his true nature to her. Next, she wishes herself back to her apartment, alone. The Djinn had been threatening Alex's sister, so Alex sets about finding Shannon. She races to Beaumont's party and Nathaniel follows. While talking to Nathaniel at the party, Beaumont makes the mistake of wishing his party would be unforgettable, and Nathaniel begins wreaking havoc by causing the art pieces to kill the guests. The djinn finally corners Alex and traps Shannon, trying to scare Alex into making the ultimate third wish. Alex wishes that the dockworker had not been drinking on the job two days ago undoing the events that followed  and trapping the Djinn in the opal. The dock scene is shown again and the now sober operator has no trouble lowering the crate containing Ahura Mazda. Alex goes to see Josh at the lab. He notices that Alex is strangely pleased with herself, but she will not say why. Back on the statue of Ahura Mazda, which is now in Beaumont's private collection, the camera zooms inside the jewel and shows us the djinn on a throne, waiting to be released.
4140604In the film, South African musicians, playwrights, poets and activists recall the struggle against apartheid from the 1940s to the 1990s that stripped black citizens of South Africa of basic human rights, and the important role that music played in that struggle. The documentary uses a mixture of interviews, musical performances and historical film footage. Among the South Africans who take part are Miriam Makeba, Abdullah Ibrahim, Hugh Masekela, Vusi Mahlasela and others. The freedom songs heard in the film have an important historical context. Particularly in the United States, freedom songs have referred to protest songs of the abolitionist, civil rights, and labor movements. Yet, in South Africa, the songs take on a different meaning, referring to a unique collection of songs tied to the struggle for racial equality during the twentieth century. Stylistically, freedom songs originated in choir as a unifying and prevalent genre that combined southern African signing traditions with Christian hymns. Most of the songs have simple melodies and are sung a cappella. More importantly, they are composed and sung in groups, and often reflect changing political circumstances and attitudes.Olwage, Grant.

129246The film opens in 1950 with Pu Yi's re-entry into the just-proclaimed People's Republic of China as a political prisoner and war criminal, having been captured by the Red Army when the Soviet Union entered the Pacific War in 1945  and been in their custody for the past five years. Puyi attempts suicide, which only renders him unconscious. In a flashback, apparently triggered as a dream, Puyi relives his first entry, with his wet nurse at his side, into the Forbidden City. The next section of the film is a series of chronological flashbacks showing Puyi's early life: from his royal upbringing, to the tumultuous period of the early Chinese Republic, to his subsequent exile, his Japanese-supported puppet reign of Manchukuo, and then his capture by the Soviet army — all of which are intermixed with flash-forwards portraying his prison life. Under the “Communist re-education program” for political prisoners, Puyi is coerced by his interrogators to formally renounce his forced collaboration with the Imperial Japanese invaders for war crimes during their occupation of China during the war. Finally, after a heated discussion with the camp commandant and upon watching a propaganda film detailing the wartime atrocities committed by the Japanese, Puyi recants his previous stance and is set free and rehabilitated by the government in 1958. The concluding section of the film ends with a flash-forward to the mid-1960s during the Mao cult and the beginning of the Cultural Revolution. By now, Puyi has become a simple gardener who lives a peasant proletarian existence. On his way home from work, he happens upon a Red Guard parade, complete with children playing pentatonic music on accordions en masse and dancers who dance the rejection of landlordism by the Communists. His prison camp commander, his only friend during his incarceration, is forced to wear a dunce cap and a sandwich board bearing punitive slogans, and is one of the political prisoners now punished as an anti-revolutionary in the parade. Puyi later visits the Forbidden City as an ordinary tourist. There he meets an assertive little boy wearing the red scarf of the Pioneer Movement. The young Communist orders Puyi to step away from the throne. However, Puyi proves to the boy that he is indeed the Son of Heaven, proceeding to approach the throne. There, Puyi discovers the 60 year old pet cricket he kept as a child and gives it to the child. Amazed by the gift, the boy turns to talk to Puyi, but the emperor has disappeared. The film ends with a tour guide leading a tour in front of the throne, where the guide sums up Puyi's life in a few, brief sentences, concluding that he died in 1967.

He is soon pulled through a window and decapitated by one of the monsters, amusingly just after it was implied that his chances of survival were very high. After the carnage, a woman - ""Heroine""  - bursts through the door and reveals herself to be the recently deceased man's wife. After a brief sentimental moment between the wife and her late husband, they begin boarding up the windows in the bar. Despite their efforts, a young monster bursts through an uncovered window and begins decapitating the people inside the bar. It dismembers one of the women - ""Harley Mom""  - and it is initially assumed that she died from massive blood loss. The monster disappears for some time, then is found attempting to sexually penetrate one of the deer heads nailed to the wall. A shotgun blast removes the deer head and monster from the wall. The monster drops into a freezer which is then sealed shut, trapping it inside. Following this, the remaining windows are boarded up and the bar patrons are given a moment of peace. Trying to call for help, they learn that the only phone in the bar has been hit by a stray shotgun blast and has been rendered useless. After a short breather, one of the women - ""Tuffy""  - suddenly realizes that her son is still upstairs and runs to get him. Once she finds her child the group rejoices until the boy is pulled through a window and eaten by one of the monsters, leaving only his sneaker behind. Tuffy is now incapacitated by grief, and the monster then vomits a stream of slime at one of the group - ""Beer Guy"" . As the remaining people regroup downstairs, they realize that the slime has a decomposing effect and that the victim is being slowly overcome by its effects. The group kills the young monster in the freezer and hangs it outside. The monster's parents quickly have sex and produce two offspring in a matter of seconds, all of whom begin to attack the pub with renewed fury. Meanwhile, one of the women - ""Honey Pie"" ([[Jenny Wade  - begins washing off the blood and has to take off her clothes, much to the amusement of the others. The patrons regroup and enact various attempts to escape or drive off the monsters, all of which lead to more casualties, including the accidental death of the Heroine at the hands of another character . Driven by rage over the death of her child, Tuffy aggressively takes charge of the remaining survivors, which results in the audience seeing her nickname change from ""Tuffy"" to ""Heroine 2"". ""Honey Pie"" successfully makes it to a truck, giving the other characters brief cause for hope . After many attacks and ultimately, a fight to the death between the last remaining humans and monsters, only four people survive the ordeal: Bozo, Hot Wheels, Tuffy , and Honey Pie. One person - ""Grandma""  - seems to survive but is seen being attacked by one of the remaining monsters at the end of the film.
3681139The Texas State University Fightin' Armadillos were once one of the most powerful teams in college football. However, shortly after winning consecutive national championships, massive NCAA violations resulted in the program having to forfeit several years' worth of victories. All of the previous players and coaches are banned from returning except Charlie Banks, the only ""clean"" player, who never got to play despite having ""heart"". The new coaching staff, led by Ed ""Straight Arrow"" Gennero , has nothing to assist them in building the team as no athletic scholarships are available, forcing them to hold tryouts. Along with this, they must worry about Dean Elias , who wants the team to fail so he can scrap it. However, the coaches soon have a makeshift team in place. Only 17 players are allowed on the team--not enough to have offense and defense--due to Dean Elias declaring many prospective players ineligible, so they are forced to play ironman football. The team lacks experience and talent in all areas, especially at quarterback, placekicker, and the defensive line. Assistant coach Wally ""Rig"" Riggendorf  recruits a 34 year old former high school star Paul Blake , who never attended college due to his father's death. Rig convinces him to enroll and play for the team. Blake arrives on campus and catches everyone's attention due to his age, especially Professor Carter . Paul then recruits a graduate student teaching assistant named Andre Krimm , who is also enrolled at the school and eligible to play for the team. Blake convinces him to join, and he is positioned on the defensive line, where he excelled years earlier. Even with the new members, the team continues to lose games. Things get so bad that, at one point during the film, announcer Chuck Neiderman  covers his microphone with his hands and screams, ""SHIT!!!!"" at the top of his lungs. Professor Carter tells Blake that she knows him from years earlier. Carter's ex-boyfriend was a high school football star, but Blake and his team humiliated him and his team in a championship game. This episode actually caused Carter to become infatuated with Blake. Now, years after the fact, the two begin a romantic relationship, which Dean Elias opposes, due to the fact that Blake is a student, and Carter is a teacher. Coach Rig makes one more recruiting move to secure a kicker. He shocks everybody by selecting Lucy Draper  from the school's soccer team. When she is brought on board, the team has its first taste of success, as Draper kicks a field goal in a driving rainstorm to forge a 3-3 tie with Kansas . After this game, Blake quits the team after arguments with the head coach  and Professor Carter, but convinces himself to come back after a teammate, who is also quitting, inadvertently changes his mind and both come back. With the coaches and players now on the same page, the team plays their last game of the season against the number one ranked team in the country, the University of Texas Colts, with whom the Armadillos were involved in a barroom brawl earlier in the season. They head into the game as huge underdogs, and without Coach Gennero, who is hospitalized just prior to the game, leaving Coach Rig in charge. After a horrible first half, they come back in the second half to make it a one point game with a few seconds left, and Gennero returns to the sideline, having only suffered from indigestion, though he lets Coach Rig call the final play. The team decides to try to win it all with a two-point conversion. They fake a point after attempt and pass for two. Blake scrambles and finally finds Banks in the end zone to win the game.
2762659{{plot}} Over the opening credits, police detective Jack Friar  is shown practicing Johannes Brahms' Trio #1 in B Major, Op.8 and injecting himself with insulin. His neighbor arrives and begs him to retrieve her daughter, who has been staying with her disreputable boyfriend on Turk Street. Friar protests that he is just a grand theft auto cop, and she needs to report the case to missing persons. He is packed and ready to go to a fantasy music camp in the Berkshires for two weeks, but he gives in to the neighbor's pleas and agrees to search for her daughter. On Turk Street, Friar shows the picture of the boyfriend to several people with no luck. As it begins to rain, he notices an elderly woman, Mrs. Quarre , who slips on her porch steps as she's carrying groceries. He runs to help her, and once inside, he meets her husband Thomas , and they make Friar a cup of tea. As they are sitting in the living room, Friar explains who he is looking for and reaches for the picture in order to show it to the Quarres. However, it blew away as he helped Mrs. Quarre with the groceries, and as he fumbles for it, Hoop  emerges and points a gun to his head. Friar is tied to a chair and a criminal plot quickly emerges, although the nature of it and the roles of the people in the house are unclear. The Quarres seem to be innocent quasi-hostages, much like himself. Hoop appears to be the near psychotic muscle man. The femme fatale is revealed to be a woman named Erin  who is involved with the ringleader Tyrone . When Tyrone is in the garden at one point, Erin and Hoop talk about running away together after their crime has been committed. The doorbell rings and it is a banker named David , who is the inside man for the heist. Erin informs him that the crime has been moved forward to today, and David thinks it's impossible. Erin says that it's the only way for the two of them to be together, and he agrees to help the team rob the bank ahead of schedule. Tyrone dispatches the Quarres to the airfield where they are to prepare a small plane for their escape to the Caribbean. He assigns Erin to stay at the house and guard Friar. She points out that David will expect to see her at the bank, but Tyrone insists that he can handle David. Tyrone and Hoop leave for the bank. Alone in the house together, Erin appears extremely sympathetic to Friar's plight. She explains that if she let him go, Tyrone would kill her. She shows Friar her right foot which is missing the second toe, claiming that Tyrone cut it off when she tried to leave him. At the bank, Hoop infiltrates the electrical system and causes a total blackout, leaving only the phone lines open. Tyrone impersonates a blind man making a $10 million transfer out of the bank, insisting that the transfer absolutely must happen by 6:00 PM. During the blackout, he uses David as a foil against the bank manager, pretending to be outraged that his transfer cannot go through. David offers to make the transfer on his laptop through a modem, much to his manager's relief. The manager hands Tyrone a disc with all the various account numbers and passwords for the transfers, but as Tyrone pretends to miss it with his outstretched hand due to his blindness, David grabs the disc. As David walks Tyrone out of the bank, he insists that he must see Erin before he hands over the disc, despite this being a departure from the plan. Tyrone and Hoop decide to go to David's house and ambush him. Meanwhile, on Turk Street, the lack of food has made Friar pass out. Erin realizes he is a diabetic and tries to revive him by dripping orange juice into his mouth. Out of desperation, she grabs his keys and wallet and drives his car to his apartment, where she finds his insulin in the refrigerator. Back at the house, she injects Friar and saves him from falling into a diabetic coma. Friar thanks her for saving his life and says that he owes her one. Erin comments on the packed bags that she noticed at Friar's apartment, and she reveals that she brought his cello back with her. Erin sits at the piano and begins to play a halting version of Chopsticks, by the end, she is playing a sophisticated, jazzlike version of the piece, revealing that she is also a musician. She explains that Tyrone rescued her from a collapsing Russia, where most of her friends went on to become prostitutes. Pointing the gun at Friar, she says she'll collect the debt he owes her for saving his life by making him play with her. She gives him a copy of Henri Duparc's Chanson Triste, and he sight reads it with her accompanying on piano. Afterward, he sits behind her and teaches her to play the cello. The two almost kiss, but Friar decides against it. He clearly has fallen for Erin, but the extent is unclear. He allows her to tie him up again, presumably so she will not be killed by Tyrone. At David's house, Hoop gets nowhere by roughing up the poor banker. He has password-protected the contents of the disc, and he refuses to divulge the password unless he sees Erin. Hoop brings Erin to David's house, leaving Friar alone on Turk Street. David insists on being alone with Erin, who coyly tries to hew to the plan that she leave with Tyrone for the Caribbean, returning for David in a few days. He wants to go with them, but Erin points out that he can't be seen with Tyrone ever again, promising that she'll return for him. David says, ""Enough promises"", and the two of them make love for the first time. Hoop gets more and more agitated as time goes by, finally barging into the room. Enraged by the sight of Erin and David in bed, he kills David without getting the password. Erin correctly guesses that the password is her name, and the three of them get in a car together, where Tyrone reveals that they are not going to meet the Quarres at the airfield. Realizing her various escape plans were being cut off, Erin concocts a story that Friar was lying about looking for a girl and was in fact looking for Tyrone, convincing Tyrone that they must return to Turk Street and kill him. Friar has loosened his bonds, and when Hoop attempts to strangle him, Friar stabs him in the neck with a corkscrew, killing him. Tyrone puts a gun in Erin's hand, trying to make her pull the trigger as her 'baptism', when the Quarres burst in with guns. The couple realized that they were being abandoned and want their cut of the bank money. As Mr. Quarre tries to take the disc from Tyrone, his shotgun goes off, killing Mrs. Quarre. Mr. Quarre is heartbroken and kills himself with her pistol. Friar convinces Tyrone, who is clearly averse to shedding blood himself, that as a cop, he can help them with their escape plan. The crew will drive to Albany and then on to the Canadian border, and Friar asserts that with the siren in his car and his badge, he can help them get to the border without incident. He asks that Erin be allowed to choose her own path from there: whether to be with Friar or Tyrone. Tyrone agrees, riding in the back seat with a shotgun aimed at Friar's back. Tyrone reveals that the $10 million has been transferred into multiple banks around Albany in smaller amounts which won't attract the attention that the original sum would. The trio spend the morning going to the various banks withdrawing the funds in cashier's checks. In order to still have the advantage over Friar, Tyrone calls each bank in advance and convinces them to allow him to withdraw the funds at the drive-thru. At one of the banks, Friar says that a security guard has written down their license plate number, convincing Tyrone that they need to stop and steal some new ones. On the way to Canada, Erin slides into the backseat with Tyrone, signaling that she will choose him, but she slips a pistol to Friar in the front seat. At the Canadian border, as they wait in line behind the other cars, Friar insists that the time has come for Tyrone to let them go. He turns around with the pistol and Tyrone fires the shotgun. Friar has placed the old license plates behind his back, shielding him from the blast. As Tyrone runs for the border with the shotgun, he is gunned down by the border police. Friar has to choose whether or not to turn Erin in, since only he knows if she was a hostage or a conspirator. She reminds him of how they almost kissed and says that they've each got their $1 million share of the cashier's checks which they could use to run away together. Friar reveals that he has torn his up and allows her to walk away. As she is leaving the border station, he tells a cop to arrest her.

456959The narrator, Angus Scrimm, in his only words in the film, introduces the audience to the creatures called ""djinn"" with the following statement: {{quote}} The next scene is set in Persia during the year 1127 A. D. with the djinn asking a Persian emperor to make his second wish. The emperor asks the djinn to show him wonders. The djinn uses his powers to torture and mutilate people in the palace. Before the emperor can make his third wish, Zoroaster, a sorcerer , interrupts and states that upon the third wish granted to the one who woke the djinn, a gateway will open between the worlds and the evil race of djinn can live on Earth. The sorcerer then reveals a fire opal. The djinn is sucked into the jewel, where he remains captured. In present day America, Raymond Beaumont  is supervising workers as they lower a box containing an antique statue of Ahura Mazda onto a ship's deck. The worker who is lowering the crate is drinking on the job and accidentally drops it from his crane, killing Beaumont's assistant  and destroying the statue. It breaks open and a dockworker finds the fire opal inside, which he steals and pawns. The jewel ends up at Regal Auctioneers, where boss Nick Merritt  gives it to appraiser Alexandra Amberson to examine. Her examinations of the jewel wake the djinn. Thinking she saw something inside the jewel, Alexandra takes it to her labworker, best friend and potential love interest Josh Aickman  to analyze. Later, as he is collecting data, light reflections cause the gem to explode and the djinn is released. The lab is destroyed and Josh is killed, upon his wish for relief from his physical pain. Alex, thinking the gem has something to do with the explosion and subsequent death of Josh, tracks down Beaumont, to whom the statue belonged. Beaumont tells Alex to visit a folklore professor named Wendy Derleth  to find out more about Ahura Mazda and the gem. He also invites Alex and her sister Shannon  to a party he is hosting. The folklore professor tells Alex about the jewel, the djinn and its evil history. Later, Alex learns that the djinn needs to power the gem with the soul of humans and then grant her three wishes before he can unleash the djinn on Earth. During this time, the djinn, who had been in demonic form, removes the face of a corpse in the morgue, taking on the dead man's form and the name Nathaniel Demerest. The djinn, now Nathaniel, goes about granting people wishes in return for their souls while he searches for Alex. He finally tracks down Alex's boss and grants him a greed-inflicted wish so that he can get Alex's address. Alex is haunted by visions whenever the djinn grants a wish. She goes to Wendy Derleth's house to consult with her again, but Nathaniel has already killed her and taken her form. During their conversation, Alex realizes she is really talking to the djinn. He confronts her and asks her to make three wishes. He even gives her a ""test"" wish. She uses this wish and orders the djinn to kill itself. He complies by blowing his head off with a gun, yet the wound heals instantly; as the djinn is immortal, he cannot be killed. Alex then uses the first of the ""official"" three wishes: her first being to know her opponent, the djinn. He teleports her to his terrifying world within the gem, thus demonstrating his true nature to her. Next, she wishes herself back to her apartment, alone. The Djinn had been threatening Alex's sister, so Alex sets about finding Shannon. She races to Beaumont's party and Nathaniel follows. While talking to Nathaniel at the party, Beaumont makes the mistake of wishing his party would be unforgettable, and Nathaniel begins wreaking havoc by causing the art pieces to kill the guests. The djinn finally corners Alex and traps Shannon, trying to scare Alex into making the ultimate third wish. Alex wishes that the dockworker had not been drinking on the job two days ago undoing the events that followed  and trapping the Djinn in the opal. The dock scene is shown again and the now sober operator has no trouble lowering the crate containing Ahura Mazda. Alex goes to see Josh at the lab. He notices that Alex is strangely pleased with herself, but she will not say why. Back on the statue of Ahura Mazda, which is now in Beaumont's private collection, the camera zooms inside the jewel and shows us the djinn on a throne, waiting to be released.
4140604In the film, South African musicians, playwrights, poets and activists recall the struggle against apartheid from the 1940s to the 1990s that stripped black citizens of South Africa of basic human rights, and the important role that music played in that struggle. The documentary uses a mixture of interviews, musical performances and historical film footage. Among the South Africans who take part are Miriam Makeba, Abdullah Ibrahim, Hugh Masekela, Vusi Mahlasela and others. The freedom songs heard in the film have an important historical context. Particularly in the United States, freedom songs have referred to protest songs of the abolitionist, civil rights, and labor movements. Yet, in South Africa, the songs take on a different meaning, referring to a unique collection of songs tied to the struggle for racial equality during the twentieth century. Stylistically, freedom songs originated in choir as a unifying and prevalent genre that combined southern African signing traditions with Christian hymns. Most of the songs have simple melodies and are sung a cappella. More importantly, they are composed and sung in groups, and often reflect changing political circumstances and attitudes.Olwage, Grant.

129246The film opens in 1950 with Pu Yi's re-entry into the just-proclaimed People's Republic of China as a political prisoner and war criminal, having been captured by the Red Army when the Soviet Union entered the Pacific War in 1945  and been in their custody for the past five years. Puyi attempts suicide, which only renders him unconscious. In a flashback, apparently triggered as a dream, Puyi relives his first entry, with his wet nurse at his side, into the Forbidden City. The next section of the film is a series of chronological flashbacks showing Puyi's early life: from his royal upbringing, to the tumultuous period of the early Chinese Republic, to his subsequent exile, his Japanese-supported puppet reign of Manchukuo, and then his capture by the Soviet army — all of which are intermixed with flash-forwards portraying his prison life. Under the “Communist re-education program” for political prisoners, Puyi is coerced by his interrogators to formally renounce his forced collaboration with the Imperial Japanese invaders for war crimes during their occupation of China during the war. Finally, after a heated discussion with the camp commandant and upon watching a propaganda film detailing the wartime atrocities committed by the Japanese, Puyi recants his previous stance and is set free and rehabilitated by the government in 1958. The concluding section of the film ends with a flash-forward to the mid-1960s during the Mao cult and the beginning of the Cultural Revolution. By now, Puyi has become a simple gardener who lives a peasant proletarian existence. On his way home from work, he happens upon a Red Guard parade, complete with children playing pentatonic music on accordions en masse and dancers who dance the rejection of landlordism by the Communists. His prison camp commander, his only friend during his incarceration, is forced to wear a dunce cap and a sandwich board bearing punitive slogans, and is one of the political prisoners now punished as an anti-revolutionary in the parade. Puyi later visits the Forbidden City as an ordinary tourist. There he meets an assertive little boy wearing the red scarf of the Pioneer Movement. The young Communist orders Puyi to step away from the throne. However, Puyi proves to the boy that he is indeed the Son of Heaven, proceeding to approach the throne. There, Puyi discovers the 60 year old pet cricket he kept as a child and gives it to the child. Amazed by the gift, the boy turns to talk to Puyi, but the emperor has disappeared. The film ends with a tour guide leading a tour in front of the throne, where the guide sums up Puyi's life in a few, brief sentences, concluding that he died in 1967.

3912910As people are enjoying drinks in a bar, a man covered in blood - identified onscreen as ""Hero""  - enters through the door and warns them all of impending danger. No one heeds his warning, so he shows the bar patrons the head of a repulsive creature to make them take him seriously. He is soon pulled through a window and decapitated by one of the monsters, amusingly just after it was implied that his chances of survival were very high. After the carnage, a woman - ""Heroine""  - bursts through the door and reveals herself to be the recently deceased man's wife. After a brief sentimental moment between the wife and her late husband, they begin boarding up the windows in the bar. Despite their efforts, a young monster bursts through an uncovered window and begins decapitating the people inside the bar. It dismembers one of the women - ""Harley Mom""  - and it is initially assumed that she died from massive blood loss. The monster disappears for some time, then is found attempting to sexually penetrate one of the deer heads nailed to the wall. A shotgun blast removes the deer head and monster from the wall. The monster drops into a freezer which is then sealed shut, trapping it inside. Following this, the remaining windows are boarded up and the bar patrons are given a moment of peace. Trying to call for help, they learn that the only phone in the bar has been hit by a stray shotgun blast and has been rendered useless. After a short breather, one of the women - ""Tuffy""  - suddenly realizes that her son is still upstairs and runs to get him. Once she finds her child the group rejoices until the boy is pulled through a window and eaten by one of the monsters, leaving only his sneaker behind. Tuffy is now incapacitated by grief, and the monster then vomits a stream of slime at one of the group - ""Beer Guy"" . As the remaining people regroup downstairs, they realize that the slime has a decomposing effect and that the victim is being slowly overcome by its effects. The group kills the young monster in the freezer and hangs it outside. The monster's parents quickly have sex and produce two offspring in a matter of seconds, all of whom begin to attack the pub with renewed fury. Meanwhile, one of the women - ""Honey Pie"" ([[Jenny Wade  - begins washing off the blood and has to take off her clothes, much to the amusement of the others. The patrons regroup and enact various attempts to escape or drive off the monsters, all of which lead to more casualties, including the accidental death of the Heroine at the hands of another character . Driven by rage over the death of her child, Tuffy aggressively takes charge of the remaining survivors, which results in the audience seeing her nickname change from ""Tuffy"" to ""Heroine 2"". ""Honey Pie"" successfully makes it to a truck, giving the other characters brief cause for hope . After many attacks and ultimately, a fight to the death between the last remaining humans and monsters, only four people survive the ordeal: Bozo, Hot Wheels, Tuffy , and Honey Pie. One person - ""Grandma""  - seems to survive but is seen being attacked by one of the remaining monsters at the end of the film.
3681139The Texas State University Fightin' Armadillos were once one of the most powerful teams in college football. However, shortly after winning consecutive national championships, massive NCAA violations resulted in the program having to forfeit several years' worth of victories. All of the previous players and coaches are banned from returning except Charlie Banks, the only ""clean"" player, who never got to play despite having ""heart"". The new coaching staff, led by Ed ""Straight Arrow"" Gennero , has nothing to assist them in building the team as no athletic scholarships are available, forcing them to hold tryouts. Along with this, they must worry about Dean Elias , who wants the team to fail so he can scrap it. However, the coaches soon have a makeshift team in place. Only 17 players are allowed on the team--not enough to have offense and defense--due to Dean Elias declaring many prospective players ineligible, so they are forced to play ironman football. The team lacks experience and talent in all areas, especially at quarterback, placekicker, and the defensive line. Assistant coach Wally ""Rig"" Riggendorf  recruits a 34 year old former high school star Paul Blake , who never attended college due to his father's death. Rig convinces him to enroll and play for the team. Blake arrives on campus and catches everyone's attention due to his age, especially Professor Carter . Paul then recruits a graduate student teaching assistant named Andre Krimm , who is also enrolled at the school and eligible to play for the team. Blake convinces him to join, and he is positioned on the defensive line, where he excelled years earlier. Even with the new members, the team continues to lose games. Things get so bad that, at one point during the film, announcer Chuck Neiderman  covers his microphone with his hands and screams, ""SHIT!!!!"" at the top of his lungs. Professor Carter tells Blake that she knows him from years earlier. Carter's ex-boyfriend was a high school football star, but Blake and his team humiliated him and his team in a championship game. This episode actually caused Carter to become infatuated with Blake. Now, years after the fact, the two begin a romantic relationship, which Dean Elias opposes, due to the fact that Blake is a student, and Carter is a teacher. Coach Rig makes one more recruiting move to secure a kicker. He shocks everybody by selecting Lucy Draper  from the school's soccer team. When she is brought on board, the team has its first taste of success, as Draper kicks a field goal in a driving rainstorm to forge a 3-3 tie with Kansas . After this game, Blake quits the team after arguments with the head coach  and Professor Carter, but convinces himself to come back after a teammate, who is also quitting, inadvertently changes his mind and both come back. With the coaches and players now on the same page, the team plays their last game of the season against the number one ranked team in the country, the University of Texas Colts, with whom the Armadillos were involved in a barroom brawl earlier in the season. They head into the game as huge underdogs, and without Coach Gennero, who is hospitalized just prior to the game, leaving Coach Rig in charge. After a horrible first half, they come back in the second half to make it a one point game with a few seconds left, and Gennero returns to the sideline, having only suffered from indigestion, though he lets Coach Rig call the final play. The team decides to try to win it all with a two-point conversion. They fake a point after attempt and pass for two. Blake scrambles and finally finds Banks in the end zone to win the game.
2762659{{plot}} Over the opening credits, police detective Jack Friar  is shown practicing Johannes Brahms' Trio #1 in B Major, Op.8 and injecting himself with insulin. His neighbor arrives and begs him to retrieve her daughter, who has been staying with her disreputable boyfriend on Turk Street. Friar protests that he is just a grand theft auto cop, and she needs to report the case to missing persons. He is packed and ready to go to a fantasy music camp in the Berkshires for two weeks, but he gives in to the neighbor's pleas and agrees to search for her daughter. On Turk Street, Friar shows the picture of the boyfriend to several people with no luck. As it begins to rain, he notices an elderly woman, Mrs. Quarre , who slips on her porch steps as she's carrying groceries. He runs to help her, and once inside, he meets her husband Thomas , and they make Friar a cup of tea. As they are sitting in the living room, Friar explains who he is looking for and reaches for the picture in order to show it to the Quarres. However, it blew away as he helped Mrs. Quarre with the groceries, and as he fumbles for it, Hoop  emerges and points a gun to his head. Friar is tied to a chair and a criminal plot quickly emerges, although the nature of it and the roles of the people in the house are unclear. The Quarres seem to be innocent quasi-hostages, much like himself. Hoop appears to be the near psychotic muscle man. The femme fatale is revealed to be a woman named Erin  who is involved with the ringleader Tyrone . When Tyrone is in the garden at one point, Erin and Hoop talk about running away together after their crime has been committed. The doorbell rings and it is a banker named David , who is the inside man for the heist. Erin informs him that the crime has been moved forward to today, and David thinks it's impossible. Erin says that it's the only way for the two of them to be together, and he agrees to help the team rob the bank ahead of schedule. Tyrone dispatches the Quarres to the airfield where they are to prepare a small plane for their escape to the Caribbean. He assigns Erin to stay at the house and guard Friar. She points out that David will expect to see her at the bank, but Tyrone insists that he can handle David. Tyrone and Hoop leave for the bank. Alone in the house together, Erin appears extremely sympathetic to Friar's plight. She explains that if she let him go, Tyrone would kill her. She shows Friar her right foot which is missing the second toe, claiming that Tyrone cut it off when she tried to leave him. At the bank, Hoop infiltrates the electrical system and causes a total blackout, leaving only the phone lines open. Tyrone impersonates a blind man making a $10 million transfer out of the bank, insisting that the transfer absolutely must happen by 6:00 PM. During the blackout, he uses David as a foil against the bank manager, pretending to be outraged that his transfer cannot go through. David offers to make the transfer on his laptop through a modem, much to his manager's relief. The manager hands Tyrone a disc with all the various account numbers and passwords for the transfers, but as Tyrone pretends to miss it with his outstretched hand due to his blindness, David grabs the disc. As David walks Tyrone out of the bank, he insists that he must see Erin before he hands over the disc, despite this being a departure from the plan. Tyrone and Hoop decide to go to David's house and ambush him. Meanwhile, on Turk Street, the lack of food has made Friar pass out. Erin realizes he is a diabetic and tries to revive him by dripping orange juice into his mouth. Out of desperation, she grabs his keys and wallet and drives his car to his apartment, where she finds his insulin in the refrigerator. Back at the house, she injects Friar and saves him from falling into a diabetic coma. Friar thanks her for saving his life and says that he owes her one. Erin comments on the packed bags that she noticed at Friar's apartment, and she reveals that she brought his cello back with her. Erin sits at the piano and begins to play a halting version of Chopsticks, by the end, she is playing a sophisticated, jazzlike version of the piece, revealing that she is also a musician. She explains that Tyrone rescued her from a collapsing Russia, where most of her friends went on to become prostitutes. Pointing the gun at Friar, she says she'll collect the debt he owes her for saving his life by making him play with her. She gives him a copy of Henri Duparc's Chanson Triste, and he sight reads it with her accompanying on piano. Afterward, he sits behind her and teaches her to play the cello. The two almost kiss, but Friar decides against it. He clearly has fallen for Erin, but the extent is unclear. He allows her to tie him up again, presumably so she will not be killed by Tyrone. At David's house, Hoop gets nowhere by roughing up the poor banker. He has password-protected the contents of the disc, and he refuses to divulge the password unless he sees Erin. Hoop brings Erin to David's house, leaving Friar alone on Turk Street. David insists on being alone with Erin, who coyly tries to hew to the plan that she leave with Tyrone for the Caribbean, returning for David in a few days. He wants to go with them, but Erin points out that he can't be seen with Tyrone ever again, promising that she'll return for him. David says, ""Enough promises"", and the two of them make love for the first time. Hoop gets more and more agitated as time goes by, finally barging into the room. Enraged by the sight of Erin and David in bed, he kills David without getting the password. Erin correctly guesses that the password is her name, and the three of them get in a car together, where Tyrone reveals that they are not going to meet the Quarres at the airfield. Realizing her various escape plans were being cut off, Erin concocts a story that Friar was lying about looking for a girl and was in fact looking for Tyrone, convincing Tyrone that they must return to Turk Street and kill him. Friar has loosened his bonds, and when Hoop attempts to strangle him, Friar stabs him in the neck with a corkscrew, killing him. Tyrone puts a gun in Erin's hand, trying to make her pull the trigger as her 'baptism', when the Quarres burst in with guns. The couple realized that they were being abandoned and want their cut of the bank money. As Mr. Quarre tries to take the disc from Tyrone, his shotgun goes off, killing Mrs. Quarre. Mr. Quarre is heartbroken and kills himself with her pistol. Friar convinces Tyrone, who is clearly averse to shedding blood himself, that as a cop, he can help them with their escape plan. The crew will drive to Albany and then on to the Canadian border, and Friar asserts that with the siren in his car and his badge, he can help them get to the border without incident. He asks that Erin be allowed to choose her own path from there: whether to be with Friar or Tyrone. Tyrone agrees, riding in the back seat with a shotgun aimed at Friar's back. Tyrone reveals that the $10 million has been transferred into multiple banks around Albany in smaller amounts which won't attract the attention that the original sum would. The trio spend the morning going to the various banks withdrawing the funds in cashier's checks. In order to still have the advantage over Friar, Tyrone calls each bank in advance and convinces them to allow him to withdraw the funds at the drive-thru. At one of the banks, Friar says that a security guard has written down their license plate number, convincing Tyrone that they need to stop and steal some new ones. On the way to Canada, Erin slides into the backseat with Tyrone, signaling that she will choose him, but she slips a pistol to Friar in the front seat. At the Canadian border, as they wait in line behind the other cars, Friar insists that the time has come for Tyrone to let them go. He turns around with the pistol and Tyrone fires the shotgun. Friar has placed the old license plates behind his back, shielding him from the blast. As Tyrone runs for the border with the shotgun, he is gunned down by the border police. Friar has to choose whether or not to turn Erin in, since only he knows if she was a hostage or a conspirator. She reminds him of how they almost kissed and says that they've each got their $1 million share of the cashier's checks which they could use to run away together. Friar reveals that he has torn his up and allows her to walk away. As she is leaving the border station, he tells a cop to arrest her.

456959The narrator, Angus Scrimm, in his only words in the film, introduces the audience to the creatures called ""djinn"" with the following statement: {{quote}} The next scene is set in Persia during the year 1127 A. D. with the djinn asking a Persian emperor to make his second wish. The emperor asks the djinn to show him wonders. The djinn uses his powers to torture and mutilate people in the palace. Before the emperor can make his third wish, Zoroaster, a sorcerer , interrupts and states that upon the third wish granted to the one who woke the djinn, a gateway will open between the worlds and the evil race of djinn can live on Earth. The sorcerer then reveals a fire opal. The djinn is sucked into the jewel, where he remains captured. In present day America, Raymond Beaumont  is supervising workers as they lower a box containing an antique statue of Ahura Mazda onto a ship's deck. The worker who is lowering the crate is drinking on the job and accidentally drops it from his crane, killing Beaumont's assistant  and destroying the statue. It breaks open and a dockworker finds the fire opal inside, which he steals and pawns. The jewel ends up at Regal Auctioneers, where boss Nick Merritt  gives it to appraiser Alexandra Amberson to examine. Her examinations of the jewel wake the djinn. Thinking she saw something inside the jewel, Alexandra takes it to her labworker, best friend and potential love interest Josh Aickman  to analyze. Later, as he is collecting data, light reflections cause the gem to explode and the djinn is released. The lab is destroyed and Josh is killed, upon his wish for relief from his physical pain. Alex, thinking the gem has something to do with the explosion and subsequent death of Josh, tracks down Beaumont, to whom the statue belonged. Beaumont tells Alex to visit a folklore professor named Wendy Derleth  to find out more about Ahura Mazda and the gem. He also invites Alex and her sister Shannon  to a party he is hosting. The folklore professor tells Alex about the jewel, the djinn and its evil history. Later, Alex learns that the djinn needs to power the gem with the soul of humans and then grant her three wishes before he can unleash the djinn on Earth. During this time, the djinn, who had been in demonic form, removes the face of a corpse in the morgue, taking on the dead man's form and the name Nathaniel Demerest. The djinn, now Nathaniel, goes about granting people wishes in return for their souls while he searches for Alex. He finally tracks down Alex's boss and grants him a greed-inflicted wish so that he can get Alex's address. Alex is haunted by visions whenever the djinn grants a wish. She goes to Wendy Derleth's house to consult with her again, but Nathaniel has already killed her and taken her form. During their conversation, Alex realizes she is really talking to the djinn. He confronts her and asks her to make three wishes. He even gives her a ""test"" wish. She uses this wish and orders the djinn to kill itself. He complies by blowing his head off with a gun, yet the wound heals instantly; as the djinn is immortal, he cannot be killed. Alex then uses the first of the ""official"" three wishes: her first being to know her opponent, the djinn. He teleports her to his terrifying world within the gem, thus demonstrating his true nature to her. Next, she wishes herself back to her apartment, alone. The Djinn had been threatening Alex's sister, so Alex sets about finding Shannon. She races to Beaumont's party and Nathaniel follows. While talking to Nathaniel at the party, Beaumont makes the mistake of wishing his party would be unforgettable, and Nathaniel begins wreaking havoc by causing the art pieces to kill the guests. The djinn finally corners Alex and traps Shannon, trying to scare Alex into making the ultimate third wish. Alex wishes that the dockworker had not been drinking on the job two days ago undoing the events that followed  and trapping the Djinn in the opal. The dock scene is shown again and the now sober operator has no trouble lowering the crate containing Ahura Mazda. Alex goes to see Josh at the lab. He notices that Alex is strangely pleased with herself, but she will not say why. Back on the statue of Ahura Mazda, which is now in Beaumont's private collection, the camera zooms inside the jewel and shows us the djinn on a throne, waiting to be released.
4140604In the film, South African musicians, playwrights, poets and activists recall the struggle against apartheid from the 1940s to the 1990s that stripped black citizens of South Africa of basic human rights, and the important role that music played in that struggle. The documentary uses a mixture of interviews, musical performances and historical film footage. Among the South Africans who take part are Miriam Makeba, Abdullah Ibrahim, Hugh Masekela, Vusi Mahlasela and others. The freedom songs heard in the film have an important historical context. Particularly in the United States, freedom songs have referred to protest songs of the abolitionist, civil rights, and labor movements. Yet, in South Africa, the songs take on a different meaning, referring to a unique collection of songs tied to the struggle for racial equality during the twentieth century. Stylistically, freedom songs originated in choir as a unifying and prevalent genre that combined southern African signing traditions with Christian hymns. Most of the songs have simple melodies and are sung a cappella. More importantly, they are composed and sung in groups, and often reflect changing political circumstances and attitudes.Olwage, Grant.

129246The film opens in 1950 with Pu Yi's re-entry into the just-proclaimed People's Republic of China as a political prisoner and war criminal, having been captured by the Red Army when the Soviet Union entered the Pacific War in 1945  and been in their custody for the past five years. Puyi attempts suicide, which only renders him unconscious. In a flashback, apparently triggered as a dream, Puyi relives his first entry, with his wet nurse at his side, into the Forbidden City. The next section of the film is a series of chronological flashbacks showing Puyi's early life: from his royal upbringing, to the tumultuous period of the early Chinese Republic, to his subsequent exile, his Japanese-supported puppet reign of Manchukuo, and then his capture by the Soviet army — all of which are intermixed with flash-forwards portraying his prison life. Under the “Communist re-education program” for political prisoners, Puyi is coerced by his interrogators to formally renounce his forced collaboration with the Imperial Japanese invaders for war crimes during their occupation of China during the war. Finally, after a heated discussion with the camp commandant and upon watching a propaganda film detailing the wartime atrocities committed by the Japanese, Puyi recants his previous stance and is set free and rehabilitated by the government in 1958. The concluding section of the film ends with a flash-forward to the mid-1960s during the Mao cult and the beginning of the Cultural Revolution. By now, Puyi has become a simple gardener who lives a peasant proletarian existence. On his way home from work, he happens upon a Red Guard parade, complete with children playing pentatonic music on accordions en masse and dancers who dance the rejection of landlordism by the Communists. His prison camp commander, his only friend during his incarceration, is forced to wear a dunce cap and a sandwich board bearing punitive slogans, and is one of the political prisoners now punished as an anti-revolutionary in the parade. Puyi later visits the Forbidden City as an ordinary tourist. There he meets an assertive little boy wearing the red scarf of the Pioneer Movement. The young Communist orders Puyi to step away from the throne. However, Puyi proves to the boy that he is indeed the Son of Heaven, proceeding to approach the throne. There, Puyi discovers the 60 year old pet cricket he kept as a child and gives it to the child. Amazed by the gift, the boy turns to talk to Puyi, but the emperor has disappeared. The film ends with a tour guide leading a tour in front of the throne, where the guide sums up Puyi's life in a few, brief sentences, concluding that he died in 1967.

3912910As people are enjoying drinks in a bar, a man covered in blood - identified onscreen as ""Hero""  - enters through the door and warns them all of impending danger. No one heeds his warning, so he shows the bar patrons the head of a repulsive creature to make them take him seriously. He is soon pulled through a window and decapitated by one of the monsters, amusingly just after it was implied that his chances of survival were very high. After the carnage, a woman - ""Heroine""  - bursts through the door and reveals herself to be the recently deceased man's wife. After a brief sentimental moment between the wife and her late husband, they begin boarding up the windows in the bar. Despite their efforts, a young monster bursts through an uncovered window and begins decapitating the people inside the bar. It dismembers one of the women - ""Harley Mom""  - and it is initially assumed that she died from massive blood loss. The monster disappears for some time, then is found attempting to sexually penetrate one of the deer heads nailed to the wall. A shotgun blast removes the deer head and monster from the wall. The monster drops into a freezer which is then sealed shut, trapping it inside. Following this, the remaining windows are boarded up and the bar patrons are given a moment of peace. Trying to call for help, they learn that the only phone in the bar has been hit by a stray shotgun blast and has been rendered useless. After a short breather, one of the women - ""Tuffy""  - suddenly realizes that her son is still upstairs and runs to get him. Once she finds her child the group rejoices until the boy is pulled through a window and eaten by one of the monsters, leaving only his sneaker behind. Tuffy is now incapacitated by grief, and the monster then vomits a stream of slime at one of the group - ""Beer Guy"" . As the remaining people regroup downstairs, they realize that the slime has a decomposing effect and that the victim is being slowly overcome by its effects. The group kills the young monster in the freezer and hangs it outside. The monster's parents quickly have sex and produce two offspring in a matter of seconds, all of whom begin to attack the pub with renewed fury. Meanwhile, one of the women - ""Honey Pie"" ([[Jenny Wade  - begins washing off the blood and has to take off her clothes, much to the amusement of the others. The patrons regroup and enact various attempts to escape or drive off the monsters, all of which lead to more casualties, including the accidental death of the Heroine at the hands of another character . Driven by rage over the death of her child, Tuffy aggressively takes charge of the remaining survivors, which results in the audience seeing her nickname change from ""Tuffy"" to ""Heroine 2"". ""Honey Pie"" successfully makes it to a truck, giving the other characters brief cause for hope . After many attacks and ultimately, a fight to the death between the last remaining humans and monsters, only four people survive the ordeal: Bozo, Hot Wheels, Tuffy , and Honey Pie. One person - ""Grandma""  - seems to survive but is seen being attacked by one of the remaining monsters at the end of the film.
3681139The Texas State University Fightin' Armadillos were once one of the most powerful teams in college football. However, shortly after winning consecutive national championships, massive NCAA violations resulted in the program having to forfeit several years' worth of victories. All of the previous players and coaches are banned from returning except Charlie Banks, the only ""clean"" player, who never got to play despite having ""heart"". The new coaching staff, led by Ed ""Straight Arrow"" Gennero , has nothing to assist them in building the team as no athletic scholarships are available, forcing them to hold tryouts. Along with this, they must worry about Dean Elias , who wants the team to fail so he can scrap it. However, the coaches soon have a makeshift team in place. Only 17 players are allowed on the team--not enough to have offense and defense--due to Dean Elias declaring many prospective players ineligible, so they are forced to play ironman football. The team lacks experience and talent in all areas, especially at quarterback, placekicker, and the defensive line. Assistant coach Wally ""Rig"" Riggendorf  recruits a 34 year old former high school star Paul Blake , who never attended college due to his father's death. Rig convinces him to enroll and play for the team. Blake arrives on campus and catches everyone's attention due to his age, especially Professor Carter . Paul then recruits a graduate student teaching assistant named Andre Krimm , who is also enrolled at the school and eligible to play for the team. Blake convinces him to join, and he is positioned on the defensive line, where he excelled years earlier. Even with the new members, the team continues to lose games. Things get so bad that, at one point during the film, announcer Chuck Neiderman  covers his microphone with his hands and screams, ""SHIT!!!!"" at the top of his lungs. Professor Carter tells Blake that she knows him from years earlier. Carter's ex-boyfriend was a high school football star, but Blake and his team humiliated him and his team in a championship game. This episode actually caused Carter to become infatuated with Blake. Now, years after the fact, the two begin a romantic relationship, which Dean Elias opposes, due to the fact that Blake is a student, and Carter is a teacher. Coach Rig makes one more recruiting move to secure a kicker. He shocks everybody by selecting Lucy Draper  from the school's soccer team. When she is brought on board, the team has its first taste of success, as Draper kicks a field goal in a driving rainstorm to forge a 3-3 tie with Kansas . After this game, Blake quits the team after arguments with the head coach  and Professor Carter, but convinces himself to come back after a teammate, who is also quitting, inadvertently changes his mind and both come back. With the coaches and players now on the same page, the team plays their last game of the season against the number one ranked team in the country, the University of Texas Colts, with whom the Armadillos were involved in a barroom brawl earlier in the season. They head into the game as huge underdogs, and without Coach Gennero, who is hospitalized just prior to the game, leaving Coach Rig in charge. After a horrible first half, they come back in the second half to make it a one point game with a few seconds left, and Gennero returns to the sideline, having only suffered from indigestion, though he lets Coach Rig call the final play. The team decides to try to win it all with a two-point conversion. They fake a point after attempt and pass for two. Blake scrambles and finally finds Banks in the end zone to win the game.
2762659{{plot}} Over the opening credits, police detective Jack Friar  is shown practicing Johannes Brahms' Trio #1 in B Major, Op.8 and injecting himself with insulin. His neighbor arrives and begs him to retrieve her daughter, who has been staying with her disreputable boyfriend on Turk Street. Friar protests that he is just a grand theft auto cop, and she needs to report the case to missing persons. He is packed and ready to go to a fantasy music camp in the Berkshires for two weeks, but he gives in to the neighbor's pleas and agrees to search for her daughter. On Turk Street, Friar shows the picture of the boyfriend to several people with no luck. As it begins to rain, he notices an elderly woman, Mrs. Quarre , who slips on her porch steps as she's carrying groceries. He runs to help her, and once inside, he meets her husband Thomas , and they make Friar a cup of tea. As they are sitting in the living room, Friar explains who he is looking for and reaches for the picture in order to show it to the Quarres. However, it blew away as he helped Mrs. Quarre with the groceries, and as he fumbles for it, Hoop  emerges and points a gun to his head. Friar is tied to a chair and a criminal plot quickly emerges, although the nature of it and the roles of the people in the house are unclear. The Quarres seem to be innocent quasi-hostages, much like himself. Hoop appears to be the near psychotic muscle man. The femme fatale is revealed to be a woman named Erin  who is involved with the ringleader Tyrone . When Tyrone is in the garden at one point, Erin and Hoop talk about running away together after their crime has been committed. The doorbell rings and it is a banker named David , who is the inside man for the heist. Erin informs him that the crime has been moved forward to today, and David thinks it's impossible. Erin says that it's the only way for the two of them to be together, and he agrees to help the team rob the bank ahead of schedule. Tyrone dispatches the Quarres to the airfield where they are to prepare a small plane for their escape to the Caribbean. He assigns Erin to stay at the house and guard Friar. She points out that David will expect to see her at the bank, but Tyrone insists that he can handle David. Tyrone and Hoop leave for the bank. Alone in the house together, Erin appears extremely sympathetic to Friar's plight. She explains that if she let him go, Tyrone would kill her. She shows Friar her right foot which is missing the second toe, claiming that Tyrone cut it off when she tried to leave him. At the bank, Hoop infiltrates the electrical system and causes a total blackout, leaving only the phone lines open. Tyrone impersonates a blind man making a $10 million transfer out of the bank, insisting that the transfer absolutely must happen by 6:00 PM. During the blackout, he uses David as a foil against the bank manager, pretending to be outraged that his transfer cannot go through. David offers to make the transfer on his laptop through a modem, much to his manager's relief. The manager hands Tyrone a disc with all the various account numbers and passwords for the transfers, but as Tyrone pretends to miss it with his outstretched hand due to his blindness, David grabs the disc. As David walks Tyrone out of the bank, he insists that he must see Erin before he hands over the disc, despite this being a departure from the plan. Tyrone and Hoop decide to go to David's house and ambush him. Meanwhile, on Turk Street, the lack of food has made Friar pass out. Erin realizes he is a diabetic and tries to revive him by dripping orange juice into his mouth. Out of desperation, she grabs his keys and wallet and drives his car to his apartment, where she finds his insulin in the refrigerator. Back at the house, she injects Friar and saves him from falling into a diabetic coma. Friar thanks her for saving his life and says that he owes her one. Erin comments on the packed bags that she noticed at Friar's apartment, and she reveals that she brought his cello back with her. Erin sits at the piano and begins to play a halting version of Chopsticks, by the end, she is playing a sophisticated, jazzlike version of the piece, revealing that she is also a musician. She explains that Tyrone rescued her from a collapsing Russia, where most of her friends went on to become prostitutes. Pointing the gun at Friar, she says she'll collect the debt he owes her for saving his life by making him play with her. She gives him a copy of Henri Duparc's Chanson Triste, and he sight reads it with her accompanying on piano. Afterward, he sits behind her and teaches her to play the cello. The two almost kiss, but Friar decides against it. He clearly has fallen for Erin, but the extent is unclear. He allows her to tie him up again, presumably so she will not be killed by Tyrone. At David's house, Hoop gets nowhere by roughing up the poor banker. He has password-protected the contents of the disc, and he refuses to divulge the password unless he sees Erin. Hoop brings Erin to David's house, leaving Friar alone on Turk Street. David insists on being alone with Erin, who coyly tries to hew to the plan that she leave with Tyrone for the Caribbean, returning for David in a few days. He wants to go with them, but Erin points out that he can't be seen with Tyrone ever again, promising that she'll return for him. David says, ""Enough promises"", and the two of them make love for the first time. Hoop gets more and more agitated as time goes by, finally barging into the room. Enraged by the sight of Erin and David in bed, he kills David without getting the password. Erin correctly guesses that the password is her name, and the three of them get in a car together, where Tyrone reveals that they are not going to meet the Quarres at the airfield. Realizing her various escape plans were being cut off, Erin concocts a story that Friar was lying about looking for a girl and was in fact looking for Tyrone, convincing Tyrone that they must return to Turk Street and kill him. Friar has loosened his bonds, and when Hoop attempts to strangle him, Friar stabs him in the neck with a corkscrew, killing him. Tyrone puts a gun in Erin's hand, trying to make her pull the trigger as her 'baptism', when the Quarres burst in with guns. The couple realized that they were being abandoned and want their cut of the bank money. As Mr. Quarre tries to take the disc from Tyrone, his shotgun goes off, killing Mrs. Quarre. Mr. Quarre is heartbroken and kills himself with her pistol. Friar convinces Tyrone, who is clearly averse to shedding blood himself, that as a cop, he can help them with their escape plan. The crew will drive to Albany and then on to the Canadian border, and Friar asserts that with the siren in his car and his badge, he can help them get to the border without incident. He asks that Erin be allowed to choose her own path from there: whether to be with Friar or Tyrone. Tyrone agrees, riding in the back seat with a shotgun aimed at Friar's back. Tyrone reveals that the $10 million has been transferred into multiple banks around Albany in smaller amounts which won't attract the attention that the original sum would. The trio spend the morning going to the various banks withdrawing the funds in cashier's checks. In order to still have the advantage over Friar, Tyrone calls each bank in advance and convinces them to allow him to withdraw the funds at the drive-thru. At one of the banks, Friar says that a security guard has written down their license plate number, convincing Tyrone that they need to stop and steal some new ones. On the way to Canada, Erin slides into the backseat with Tyrone, signaling that she will choose him, but she slips a pistol to Friar in the front seat. At the Canadian border, as they wait in line behind the other cars, Friar insists that the time has come for Tyrone to let them go. He turns around with the pistol and Tyrone fires the shotgun. Friar has placed the old license plates behind his back, shielding him from the blast. As Tyrone runs for the border with the shotgun, he is gunned down by the border police. Friar has to choose whether or not to turn Erin in, since only he knows if she was a hostage or a conspirator. She reminds him of how they almost kissed and says that they've each got their $1 million share of the cashier's checks which they could use to run away together. Friar reveals that he has torn his up and allows her to walk away. As she is leaving the border station, he tells a cop to arrest her.

456959The narrator, Angus Scrimm, in his only words in the film, introduces the audience to the creatures called ""djinn"" with the following statement: {{quote}} The next scene is set in Persia during the year 1127 A. D. with the djinn asking a Persian emperor to make his second wish. The emperor asks the djinn to show him wonders. The djinn uses his powers to torture and mutilate people in the palace. Before the emperor can make his third wish, Zoroaster, a sorcerer , interrupts and states that upon the third wish granted to the one who woke the djinn, a gateway will open between the worlds and the evil race of djinn can live on Earth. The sorcerer then reveals a fire opal. The djinn is sucked into the jewel, where he remains captured. In present day America, Raymond Beaumont  is supervising workers as they lower a box containing an antique statue of Ahura Mazda onto a ship's deck. The worker who is lowering the crate is drinking on the job and accidentally drops it from his crane, killing Beaumont's assistant  and destroying the statue. It breaks open and a dockworker finds the fire opal inside, which he steals and pawns. The jewel ends up at Regal Auctioneers, where boss Nick Merritt  gives it to appraiser Alexandra Amberson to examine. Her examinations of the jewel wake the djinn. Thinking she saw something inside the jewel, Alexandra takes it to her labworker, best friend and potential love interest Josh Aickman  to analyze. Later, as he is collecting data, light reflections cause the gem to explode and the djinn is released. The lab is destroyed and Josh is killed, upon his wish for relief from his physical pain. Alex, thinking the gem has something to do with the explosion and subsequent death of Josh, tracks down Beaumont, to whom the statue belonged. Beaumont tells Alex to visit a folklore professor named Wendy Derleth  to find out more about Ahura Mazda and the gem. He also invites Alex and her sister Shannon  to a party he is hosting. The folklore professor tells Alex about the jewel, the djinn and its evil history. Later, Alex learns that the djinn needs to power the gem with the soul of humans and then grant her three wishes before he can unleash the djinn on Earth. During this time, the djinn, who had been in demonic form, removes the face of a corpse in the morgue, taking on the dead man's form and the name Nathaniel Demerest. The djinn, now Nathaniel, goes about granting people wishes in return for their souls while he searches for Alex. He finally tracks down Alex's boss and grants him a greed-inflicted wish so that he can get Alex's address. Alex is haunted by visions whenever the djinn grants a wish. She goes to Wendy Derleth's house to consult with her again, but Nathaniel has already killed her and taken her form. During their conversation, Alex realizes she is really talking to the djinn. He confronts her and asks her to make three wishes. He even gives her a ""test"" wish. She uses this wish and orders the djinn to kill itself. He complies by blowing his head off with a gun, yet the wound heals instantly; as the djinn is immortal, he cannot be killed. Alex then uses the first of the ""official"" three wishes: her first being to know her opponent, the djinn. He teleports her to his terrifying world within the gem, thus demonstrating his true nature to her. Next, she wishes herself back to her apartment, alone. The Djinn had been threatening Alex's sister, so Alex sets about finding Shannon. She races to Beaumont's party and Nathaniel follows. While talking to Nathaniel at the party, Beaumont makes the mistake of wishing his party would be unforgettable, and Nathaniel begins wreaking havoc by causing the art pieces to kill the guests. The djinn finally corners Alex and traps Shannon, trying to scare Alex into making the ultimate third wish. Alex wishes that the dockworker had not been drinking on the job two days ago undoing the events that followed  and trapping the Djinn in the opal. The dock scene is shown again and the now sober operator has no trouble lowering the crate containing Ahura Mazda. Alex goes to see Josh at the lab. He notices that Alex is strangely pleased with herself, but she will not say why. Back on the statue of Ahura Mazda, which is now in Beaumont's private collection, the camera zooms inside the jewel and shows us the djinn on a throne, waiting to be released.
4140604In the film, South African musicians, playwrights, poets and activists recall the struggle against apartheid from the 1940s to the 1990s that stripped black citizens of South Africa of basic human rights, and the important role that music played in that struggle. The documentary uses a mixture of interviews, musical performances and historical film footage. Among the South Africans who take part are Miriam Makeba, Abdullah Ibrahim, Hugh Masekela, Vusi Mahlasela and others. The freedom songs heard in the film have an important historical context. Particularly in the United States, freedom songs have referred to protest songs of the abolitionist, civil rights, and labor movements. Yet, in South Africa, the songs take on a different meaning, referring to a unique collection of songs tied to the struggle for racial equality during the twentieth century. Stylistically, freedom songs originated in choir as a unifying and prevalent genre that combined southern African signing traditions with Christian hymns. Most of the songs have simple melodies and are sung a cappella. More importantly, they are composed and sung in groups, and often reflect changing political circumstances and attitudes.Olwage, Grant.

129246The film opens in 1950 with Pu Yi's re-entry into the just-proclaimed People's Republic of China as a political prisoner and war criminal, having been captured by the Red Army when the Soviet Union entered the Pacific War in 1945  and been in their custody for the past five years. Puyi attempts suicide, which only renders him unconscious. In a flashback, apparently triggered as a dream, Puyi relives his first entry, with his wet nurse at his side, into the Forbidden City. The next section of the film is a series of chronological flashbacks showing Puyi's early life: from his royal upbringing, to the tumultuous period of the early Chinese Republic, to his subsequent exile, his Japanese-supported puppet reign of Manchukuo, and then his capture by the Soviet army — all of which are intermixed with flash-forwards portraying his prison life. Under the “Communist re-education program” for political prisoners, Puyi is coerced by his interrogators to formally renounce his forced collaboration with the Imperial Japanese invaders for war crimes during their occupation of China during the war. Finally, after a heated discussion with the camp commandant and upon watching a propaganda film detailing the wartime atrocities committed by the Japanese, Puyi recants his previous stance and is set free and rehabilitated by the government in 1958. The concluding section of the film ends with a flash-forward to the mid-1960s during the Mao cult and the beginning of the Cultural Revolution. By now, Puyi has become a simple gardener who lives a peasant proletarian existence. On his way home from work, he happens upon a Red Guard parade, complete with children playing pentatonic music on accordions en masse and dancers who dance the rejection of landlordism by the Communists. His prison camp commander, his only friend during his incarceration, is forced to wear a dunce cap and a sandwich board bearing punitive slogans, and is one of the political prisoners now punished as an anti-revolutionary in the parade. Puyi later visits the Forbidden City as an ordinary tourist. There he meets an assertive little boy wearing the red scarf of the Pioneer Movement. The young Communist orders Puyi to step away from the throne. However, Puyi proves to the boy that he is indeed the Son of Heaven, proceeding to approach the throne. There, Puyi discovers the 60 year old pet cricket he kept as a child and gives it to the child. Amazed by the gift, the boy turns to talk to Puyi, but the emperor has disappeared. The film ends with a tour guide leading a tour in front of the throne, where the guide sums up Puyi's life in a few, brief sentences, concluding that he died in 1967.

3912910As people are enjoying drinks in a bar, a man covered in blood - identified onscreen as ""Hero""  - enters through the door and warns them all of impending danger. No one heeds his warning, so he shows the bar patrons the head of a repulsive creature to make them take him seriously. He is soon pulled through a window and decapitated by one of the monsters, amusingly just after it was implied that his chances of survival were very high. After the carnage, a woman - ""Heroine""  - bursts through the door and reveals herself to be the recently deceased man's wife. After a brief sentimental moment between the wife and her late husband, they begin boarding up the windows in the bar. Despite their efforts, a young monster bursts through an uncovered window and begins decapitating the people inside the bar. It dismembers one of the women - ""Harley Mom""  - and it is initially assumed that she died from massive blood loss. The monster disappears for some time, then is found attempting to sexually penetrate one of the deer heads nailed to the wall. A shotgun blast removes the deer head and monster from the wall. The monster drops into a freezer which is then sealed shut, trapping it inside. Following this, the remaining windows are boarded up and the bar patrons are given a moment of peace. Trying to call for help, they learn that the only phone in the bar has been hit by a stray shotgun blast and has been rendered useless. After a short breather, one of the women - ""Tuffy""  - suddenly realizes that her son is still upstairs and runs to get him. Once she finds her child the group rejoices until the boy is pulled through a window and eaten by one of the monsters, leaving only his sneaker behind. Tuffy is now incapacitated by grief, and the monster then vomits a stream of slime at one of the group - ""Beer Guy"" . As the remaining people regroup downstairs, they realize that the slime has a decomposing effect and that the victim is being slowly overcome by its effects. The group kills the young monster in the freezer and hangs it outside. The monster's parents quickly have sex and produce two offspring in a matter of seconds, all of whom begin to attack the pub with renewed fury. Meanwhile, one of the women - ""Honey Pie"" ([[Jenny Wade  - begins washing off the blood and has to take off her clothes, much to the amusement of the others. The patrons regroup and enact various attempts to escape or drive off the monsters, all of which lead to more casualties, including the accidental death of the Heroine at the hands of another character . Driven by rage over the death of her child, Tuffy aggressively takes charge of the remaining survivors, which results in the audience seeing her nickname change from ""Tuffy"" to ""Heroine 2"". ""Honey Pie"" successfully makes it to a truck, giving the other characters brief cause for hope . After many attacks and ultimately, a fight to the death between the last remaining humans and monsters, only four people survive the ordeal: Bozo, Hot Wheels, Tuffy , and Honey Pie. One person - ""Grandma""  - seems to survive but is seen being attacked by one of the remaining monsters at the end of the film.
3681139The Texas State University Fightin' Armadillos were once one of the most powerful teams in college football. However, shortly after winning consecutive national championships, massive NCAA violations resulted in the program having to forfeit several years' worth of victories. All of the previous players and coaches are banned from returning except Charlie Banks, the only ""clean"" player, who never got to play despite having ""heart"". The new coaching staff, led by Ed ""Straight Arrow"" Gennero , has nothing to assist them in building the team as no athletic scholarships are available, forcing them to hold tryouts. Along with this, they must worry about Dean Elias , who wants the team to fail so he can scrap it. However, the coaches soon have a makeshift team in place. Only 17 players are allowed on the team--not enough to have offense and defense--due to Dean Elias declaring many prospective players ineligible, so they are forced to play ironman football. The team lacks experience and talent in all areas, especially at quarterback, placekicker, and the defensive line. Assistant coach Wally ""Rig"" Riggendorf  recruits a 34 year old former high school star Paul Blake , who never attended college due to his father's death. Rig convinces him to enroll and play for the team. Blake arrives on campus and catches everyone's attention due to his age, especially Professor Carter . Paul then recruits a graduate student teaching assistant named Andre Krimm , who is also enrolled at the school and eligible to play for the team. Blake convinces him to join, and he is positioned on the defensive line, where he excelled years earlier. Even with the new members, the team continues to lose games. Things get so bad that, at one point during the film, announcer Chuck Neiderman  covers his microphone with his hands and screams, ""SHIT!!!!"" at the top of his lungs. Professor Carter tells Blake that she knows him from years earlier. Carter's ex-boyfriend was a high school football star, but Blake and his team humiliated him and his team in a championship game. This episode actually caused Carter to become infatuated with Blake. Now, years after the fact, the two begin a romantic relationship, which Dean Elias opposes, due to the fact that Blake is a student, and Carter is a teacher. Coach Rig makes one more recruiting move to secure a kicker. He shocks everybody by selecting Lucy Draper  from the school's soccer team. When she is brought on board, the team has its first taste of success, as Draper kicks a field goal in a driving rainstorm to forge a 3-3 tie with Kansas . After this game, Blake quits the team after arguments with the head coach  and Professor Carter, but convinces himself to come back after a teammate, who is also quitting, inadvertently changes his mind and both come back. With the coaches and players now on the same page, the team plays their last game of the season against the number one ranked team in the country, the University of Texas Colts, with whom the Armadillos were involved in a barroom brawl earlier in the season. They head into the game as huge underdogs, and without Coach Gennero, who is hospitalized just prior to the game, leaving Coach Rig in charge. After a horrible first half, they come back in the second half to make it a one point game with a few seconds left, and Gennero returns to the sideline, having only suffered from indigestion, though he lets Coach Rig call the final play. The team decides to try to win it all with a two-point conversion. They fake a point after attempt and pass for two. Blake scrambles and finally finds Banks in the end zone to win the game.
2762659{{plot}} Over the opening credits, police detective Jack Friar  is shown practicing Johannes Brahms' Trio #1 in B Major, Op.8 and injecting himself with insulin. His neighbor arrives and begs him to retrieve her daughter, who has been staying with her disreputable boyfriend on Turk Street. Friar protests that he is just a grand theft auto cop, and she needs to report the case to missing persons. He is packed and ready to go to a fantasy music camp in the Berkshires for two weeks, but he gives in to the neighbor's pleas and agrees to search for her daughter. On Turk Street, Friar shows the picture of the boyfriend to several people with no luck. As it begins to rain, he notices an elderly woman, Mrs. Quarre , who slips on her porch steps as she's carrying groceries. He runs to help her, and once inside, he meets her husband Thomas , and they make Friar a cup of tea. As they are sitting in the living room, Friar explains who he is looking for and reaches for the picture in order to show it to the Quarres. However, it blew away as he helped Mrs. Quarre with the groceries, and as he fumbles for it, Hoop  emerges and points a gun to his head. Friar is tied to a chair and a criminal plot quickly emerges, although the nature of it and the roles of the people in the house are unclear. The Quarres seem to be innocent quasi-hostages, much like himself. Hoop appears to be the near psychotic muscle man. The femme fatale is revealed to be a woman named Erin  who is involved with the ringleader Tyrone . When Tyrone is in the garden at one point, Erin and Hoop talk about running away together after their crime has been committed. The doorbell rings and it is a banker named David , who is the inside man for the heist. Erin informs him that the crime has been moved forward to today, and David thinks it's impossible. Erin says that it's the only way for the two of them to be together, and he agrees to help the team rob the bank ahead of schedule. Tyrone dispatches the Quarres to the airfield where they are to prepare a small plane for their escape to the Caribbean. He assigns Erin to stay at the house and guard Friar. She points out that David will expect to see her at the bank, but Tyrone insists that he can handle David. Tyrone and Hoop leave for the bank. Alone in the house together, Erin appears extremely sympathetic to Friar's plight. She explains that if she let him go, Tyrone would kill her. She shows Friar her right foot which is missing the second toe, claiming that Tyrone cut it off when she tried to leave him. At the bank, Hoop infiltrates the electrical system and causes a total blackout, leaving only the phone lines open. Tyrone impersonates a blind man making a $10 million transfer out of the bank, insisting that the transfer absolutely must happen by 6:00 PM. During the blackout, he uses David as a foil against the bank manager, pretending to be outraged that his transfer cannot go through. David offers to make the transfer on his laptop through a modem, much to his manager's relief. The manager hands Tyrone a disc with all the various account numbers and passwords for the transfers, but as Tyrone pretends to miss it with his outstretched hand due to his blindness, David grabs the disc. As David walks Tyrone out of the bank, he insists that he must see Erin before he hands over the disc, despite this being a departure from the plan. Tyrone and Hoop decide to go to David's house and ambush him. Meanwhile, on Turk Street, the lack of food has made Friar pass out. Erin realizes he is a diabetic and tries to revive him by dripping orange juice into his mouth. Out of desperation, she grabs his keys and wallet and drives his car to his apartment, where she finds his insulin in the refrigerator. Back at the house, she injects Friar and saves him from falling into a diabetic coma. Friar thanks her for saving his life and says that he owes her one. Erin comments on the packed bags that she noticed at Friar's apartment, and she reveals that she brought his cello back with her. Erin sits at the piano and begins to play a halting version of Chopsticks, by the end, she is playing a sophisticated, jazzlike version of the piece, revealing that she is also a musician. She explains that Tyrone rescued her from a collapsing Russia, where most of her friends went on to become prostitutes. Pointing the gun at Friar, she says she'll collect the debt he owes her for saving his life by making him play with her. She gives him a copy of Henri Duparc's Chanson Triste, and he sight reads it with her accompanying on piano. Afterward, he sits behind her and teaches her to play the cello. The two almost kiss, but Friar decides against it. He clearly has fallen for Erin, but the extent is unclear. He allows her to tie him up again, presumably so she will not be killed by Tyrone. At David's house, Hoop gets nowhere by roughing up the poor banker. He has password-protected the contents of the disc, and he refuses to divulge the password unless he sees Erin. Hoop brings Erin to David's house, leaving Friar alone on Turk Street. David insists on being alone with Erin, who coyly tries to hew to the plan that she leave with Tyrone for the Caribbean, returning for David in a few days. He wants to go with them, but Erin points out that he can't be seen with Tyrone ever again, promising that she'll return for him. David says, ""Enough promises"", and the two of them make love for the first time. Hoop gets more and more agitated as time goes by, finally barging into the room. Enraged by the sight of Erin and David in bed, he kills David without getting the password. Erin correctly guesses that the password is her name, and the three of them get in a car together, where Tyrone reveals that they are not going to meet the Quarres at the airfield. Realizing her various escape plans were being cut off, Erin concocts a story that Friar was lying about looking for a girl and was in fact looking for Tyrone, convincing Tyrone that they must return to Turk Street and kill him. Friar has loosened his bonds, and when Hoop attempts to strangle him, Friar stabs him in the neck with a corkscrew, killing him. Tyrone puts a gun in Erin's hand, trying to make her pull the trigger as her 'baptism', when the Quarres burst in with guns. The couple realized that they were being abandoned and want their cut of the bank money. As Mr. Quarre tries to take the disc from Tyrone, his shotgun goes off, killing Mrs. Quarre. Mr. Quarre is heartbroken and kills himself with her pistol. Friar convinces Tyrone, who is clearly averse to shedding blood himself, that as a cop, he can help them with their escape plan. The crew will drive to Albany and then on to the Canadian border, and Friar asserts that with the siren in his car and his badge, he can help them get to the border without incident. He asks that Erin be allowed to choose her own path from there: whether to be with Friar or Tyrone. Tyrone agrees, riding in the back seat with a shotgun aimed at Friar's back. Tyrone reveals that the $10 million has been transferred into multiple banks around Albany in smaller amounts which won't attract the attention that the original sum would. The trio spend the morning going to the various banks withdrawing the funds in cashier's checks. In order to still have the advantage over Friar, Tyrone calls each bank in advance and convinces them to allow him to withdraw the funds at the drive-thru. At one of the banks, Friar says that a security guard has written down their license plate number, convincing Tyrone that they need to stop and steal some new ones. On the way to Canada, Erin slides into the backseat with Tyrone, signaling that she will choose him, but she slips a pistol to Friar in the front seat. At the Canadian border, as they wait in line behind the other cars, Friar insists that the time has come for Tyrone to let them go. He turns around with the pistol and Tyrone fires the shotgun. Friar has placed the old license plates behind his back, shielding him from the blast. As Tyrone runs for the border with the shotgun, he is gunned down by the border police. Friar has to choose whether or not to turn Erin in, since only he knows if she was a hostage or a conspirator. She reminds him of how they almost kissed and says that they've each got their $1 million share of the cashier's checks which they could use to run away together. Friar reveals that he has torn his up and allows her to walk away. As she is leaving the border station, he tells a cop to arrest her.

456959The narrator, Angus Scrimm, in his only words in the film, introduces the audience to the creatures called ""djinn"" with the following statement: {{quote}} The next scene is set in Persia during the year 1127 A. D. with the djinn asking a Persian emperor to make his second wish. The emperor asks the djinn to show him wonders. The djinn uses his powers to torture and mutilate people in the palace. Before the emperor can make his third wish, Zoroaster, a sorcerer , interrupts and states that upon the third wish granted to the one who woke the djinn, a gateway will open between the worlds and the evil race of djinn can live on Earth. The sorcerer then reveals a fire opal. The djinn is sucked into the jewel, where he remains captured. In present day America, Raymond Beaumont  is supervising workers as they lower a box containing an antique statue of Ahura Mazda onto a ship's deck. The worker who is lowering the crate is drinking on the job and accidentally drops it from his crane, killing Beaumont's assistant  and destroying the statue. It breaks open and a dockworker finds the fire opal inside, which he steals and pawns. The jewel ends up at Regal Auctioneers, where boss Nick Merritt  gives it to appraiser Alexandra Amberson to examine. Her examinations of the jewel wake the djinn. Thinking she saw something inside the jewel, Alexandra takes it to her labworker, best friend and potential love interest Josh Aickman  to analyze. Later, as he is collecting data, light reflections cause the gem to explode and the djinn is released. The lab is destroyed and Josh is killed, upon his wish for relief from his physical pain. Alex, thinking the gem has something to do with the explosion and subsequent death of Josh, tracks down Beaumont, to whom the statue belonged. Beaumont tells Alex to visit a folklore professor named Wendy Derleth  to find out more about Ahura Mazda and the gem. He also invites Alex and her sister Shannon  to a party he is hosting. The folklore professor tells Alex about the jewel, the djinn and its evil history. Later, Alex learns that the djinn needs to power the gem with the soul of humans and then grant her three wishes before he can unleash the djinn on Earth. During this time, the djinn, who had been in demonic form, removes the face of a corpse in the morgue, taking on the dead man's form and the name Nathaniel Demerest. The djinn, now Nathaniel, goes about granting people wishes in return for their souls while he searches for Alex. He finally tracks down Alex's boss and grants him a greed-inflicted wish so that he can get Alex's address. Alex is haunted by visions whenever the djinn grants a wish. She goes to Wendy Derleth's house to consult with her again, but Nathaniel has already killed her and taken her form. During their conversation, Alex realizes she is really talking to the djinn. He confronts her and asks her to make three wishes. He even gives her a ""test"" wish. She uses this wish and orders the djinn to kill itself. He complies by blowing his head off with a gun, yet the wound heals instantly; as the djinn is immortal, he cannot be killed. Alex then uses the first of the ""official"" three wishes: her first being to know her opponent, the djinn. He teleports her to his terrifying world within the gem, thus demonstrating his true nature to her. Next, she wishes herself back to her apartment, alone. The Djinn had been threatening Alex's sister, so Alex sets about finding Shannon. She races to Beaumont's party and Nathaniel follows. While talking to Nathaniel at the party, Beaumont makes the mistake of wishing his party would be unforgettable, and Nathaniel begins wreaking havoc by causing the art pieces to kill the guests. The djinn finally corners Alex and traps Shannon, trying to scare Alex into making the ultimate third wish. Alex wishes that the dockworker had not been drinking on the job two days ago undoing the events that followed  and trapping the Djinn in the opal.

4140604In the film, South African musicians, playwrights, poets and activists recall the struggle against apartheid from the 1940s to the 1990s that stripped black citizens of South Africa of basic human rights, and the important role that music played in that struggle. The documentary uses a mixture of interviews, musical performances and historical film footage. Among the South Africans who take part are Miriam Makeba, Abdullah Ibrahim, Hugh Masekela, Vusi Mahlasela and others. The freedom songs heard in the film have an important historical context. Particularly in the United States, freedom songs have referred to protest songs of the abolitionist, civil rights, and labor movements. Yet, in South Africa, the songs take on a different meaning, referring to a unique collection of songs tied to the struggle for racial equality during the twentieth century. Stylistically, freedom songs originated in choir as a unifying and prevalent genre that combined southern African signing traditions with Christian hymns. Most of the songs have simple melodies and are sung a cappella. More importantly, they are composed and sung in groups, and often reflect changing political circumstances and attitudes.Olwage, Grant.

129246The film opens in 1950 with Pu Yi's re-entry into the just-proclaimed People's Republic of China as a political prisoner and war criminal, having been captured by the Red Army when the Soviet Union entered the Pacific War in 1945  and been in their custody for the past five years. Puyi attempts suicide, which only renders him unconscious. In a flashback, apparently triggered as a dream, Puyi relives his first entry, with his wet nurse at his side, into the Forbidden City. The next section of the film is a series of chronological flashbacks showing Puyi's early life: from his royal upbringing, to the tumultuous period of the early Chinese Republic, to his subsequent exile, his Japanese-supported puppet reign of Manchukuo, and then his capture by the Soviet army — all of which are intermixed with flash-forwards portraying his prison life. Under the “Communist re-education program” for political prisoners, Puyi is coerced by his interrogators to formally renounce his forced collaboration with the Imperial Japanese invaders for war crimes during their occupation of China during the war. Finally, after a heated discussion with the camp commandant and upon watching a propaganda film detailing the wartime atrocities committed by the Japanese, Puyi recants his previous stance and is set free and rehabilitated by the government in 1958. The concluding section of the film ends with a flash-forward to the mid-1960s during the Mao cult and the beginning of the Cultural Revolution. By now, Puyi has become a simple gardener who lives a peasant proletarian existence. On his way home from work, he happens upon a Red Guard parade, complete with children playing pentatonic music on accordions en masse and dancers who dance the rejection of landlordism by the Communists. His prison camp commander, his only friend during his incarceration, is forced to wear a dunce cap and a sandwich board bearing punitive slogans, and is one of the political prisoners now punished as an anti-revolutionary in the parade. Puyi later visits the Forbidden City as an ordinary tourist. There he meets an assertive little boy wearing the red scarf of the Pioneer Movement. The young Communist orders Puyi to step away from the throne. However, Puyi proves to the boy that he is indeed the Son of Heaven, proceeding to approach the throne. There, Puyi discovers the 60 year old pet cricket he kept as a child and gives it to the child. Amazed by the gift, the boy turns to talk to Puyi, but the emperor has disappeared. The film ends with a tour guide leading a tour in front of the throne, where the guide sums up Puyi's life in a few, brief sentences, concluding that he died in 1967.

He is sentenced to three months  in prison, and ordered to pay hefty damages and costs. Lisbeth Salander , who is a surveillance agent has been contracted to investigate Blomkvist by a lawyer, Dirch Frode , on behalf of his sole client, Henrik Vanger , the elderly patriarch of the wealthy Vanger family. Before the publisher is imprisioned, Vanger hires Blomkvist to investigate the disappearance of his great-niece, Harriet, who vanished on Children's Day in 1966. Vanger believes that Harriet was murdered by a family member. When Salander is told that her legal guardian has suffered a stroke, she is instructed to meet lawyer Nils Bjurman ([[Peter Andersson , who takes control of her finances. Bjurman, a sexual sadist, forces Salander to perform fellatio on him in return for access to her bank account. At their next meeting, he beats her, handcuffs her to his bed, and anally rapes her, not knowing that Salander is recording the incident with a hidden video camera. After Salander recovers from the rape, she pays Bjurman an unexpected visit. She stuns him with a taser and ties him up. She compels him to relinquish control of her finances and in one year's time to recommend termination of her state guardianship. Failure to comply with her demands will result in the release of the DVD evidence of her rape to the media. Salander tattoos Bjurman's abdomen with the message ""I am a sadist pig and a rapist"". Blomkvist moves into a cottage on the Vanger estate. Vanger tells him that his three brothers were all members of the Swedish Nazi Party. Of the three, only Harald is still living. Inside Harriet's Bible, Blomkvist finds a list of five names alongside what might appear to be phone numbers. He visits police inspector Morell , who informs him that his investigation team had been unable to decipher them. Using photographs taken during the Children's Day parade, Blomkvist believes that Harriet may have seen someone that day who may have killed her. Using her access to Blomkvist's computer, Salander interprets the meaning of the numbers next to the names and sends an email to Blomkvist. Upon discovering that his computer has been hacked, Blomkvist is directed by Dirch Frode to Salander's apartment. He convinces her to help him with the case, and she joins him at the cottage. Together, using the clue that Salander discovered, they connect all but one of the names on Harriet's list to murdered women.

He is sentenced to three months  in prison, and ordered to pay hefty damages and costs. Lisbeth Salander , who is a surveillance agent has been contracted to investigate Blomkvist by a lawyer, Dirch Frode , on behalf of his sole client, Henrik Vanger , the elderly patriarch of the wealthy Vanger family. Before the publisher is imprisioned, Vanger hires Blomkvist to investigate the disappearance of his great-niece, Harriet, who vanished on Children's Day in 1966. Vanger believes that Harriet was murdered by a family member. When Salander is told that her legal guardian has suffered a stroke, she is instructed to meet lawyer Nils Bjurman ([[Peter Andersson , who takes control of her finances. Bjurman, a sexual sadist, forces Salander to perform fellatio on him in return for access to her bank account. At their next meeting, he beats her, handcuffs her to his bed, and anally rapes her, not knowing that Salander is recording the incident with a hidden video camera. After Salander recovers from the rape, she pays Bjurman an unexpected visit. She stuns him with a taser and ties him up. She compels him to relinquish control of her finances and in one year's time to recommend termination of her state guardianship. Failure to comply with her demands will result in the release of the DVD evidence of her rape to the media. Salander tattoos Bjurman's abdomen with the message ""I am a sadist pig and a rapist"".

Using photographs taken during the Children's Day parade, Blomkvist believes that Harriet may have seen someone that day who may have killed her. Using her access to Blomkvist's computer, Salander interprets the meaning of the numbers next to the names and sends an email to Blomkvist. Upon discovering that his computer has been hacked, Blomkvist is directed by Dirch Frode to Salander's apartment. He convinces her to help him with the case, and she joins him at the cottage.

As command pilot of the I/P/T transport ship Armstrong, a space-weary NASA discard now used routinely in sub-orbital transport runs, the attractive, highly proficient pilot has her hands full. Upon entering the ship to prepare for liftoff, she's chagrined to find that her flight has been reassigned to another command pilot, Cooper Wayne , a daredevil she knows all too well -- as an ex-lover from whom she just had to walk away. Avedon is further annoyed to find that the flight is another ""mystery run,"" no paperwork, no flight plan, and a handful of passengers on what should be a cargo carrier. The eclectic riffraff of passengers includes Lazarus , a two-bit hustler; Dr. Shephard , a skilled former micro-surgeon now addicted to his own self-prescribed medications; Cade , an edgy young man obsessed with finding the wife who deserted him; and Sarra , a flawlessly beautiful young woman with a mysterious past. About the only ""stand-up guy"" aboard is chief engineer Mick 'Clean' McClean , a technical genius who's called upon regularly to repair just about every system on board the tired ship. After takeoff, two booster rockets become obstructed and the Avedon is forced to crash land in a desolate, uncharted region of the South Asian desert wracked by seismic tremors. While trying to recover tridymite to fabricate new flight data circuit boards, the crew stumbles upon an underground military depository for advanced biological weapons. One of the passengers gets infected by the weapons and turns into a zombie with murderous proclivities. Avedon and Cooper attempt to protect the other passengers and get the plane repaired and to safety as soon as is possible.http://www.100percentent.com/ravager.htm"

A man in a strange hat greets a man sitting in a chair and addresses him as ""Bingo"". When the man in the chair denies being named Bingo, the man in the hat insists that he is, in fact, ""Bingo the Clown-o"". As the man in the chair tries to correct him, the man in the hat continues to address him as Bingo at greater and greater volume, ending with a loud shout and cutting off the protests. After a fade to black, the same basic scene begins to play out again, this time with computer-animated characters. A man, ""Dave,"" is sitting in a chair under a spotlight and surrounded by darkness. A clown enters, smoking a cigarette, and addresses Dave as ""Bingo."" Dave starts to protest that he's not ""Bingo the Clown,"" but the clown ignores him and repeats the phrases ""Hi, Bingo!"" and ""Bingo the Clown!"" With each repetition, the clown's voice gets louder and he grows physically larger until he is screaming at Dave with a head larger than Dave's entire body. A female harlequin enters, calling for ""Music, please!"" As she exits, the stage is illuminated and an instrumental version of the song ""Daisy Bell""  begins to play. Strange screens rise up from under the floor and begin displaying a series of seemingly random images interspersed with pictures of clowns and the words ""Hi Bingo!"" At the same time, the clown begins riding a bicycle in circles around Dave while balancing a piano on one hand, and Dave is bombarded with peanuts. The harlequin descends from the ceiling and orders the music to stop. As she exits, the music stops and the lights dim, leaving Dave alone in a spotlight once again. A little girl clown enters, holding a balloon that keeps bursting and re-inflating in new colors. She addresses Dave as ""Bingo"" and warns him that ""he"" is coming to ""check on your progress."" When Dave asks if Bingo is the one who is coming, the balloon girl's face transforms into a gigantic, snake-like monster and she shouts that Dave is Bingo. She then turns immediately back into a little girl to inform Dave that ""he"" is coming. The first clown walks through the spotlight, still carrying the piano in one hand, and drops his bicycle beside Dave's chair before leaving. The balloon girl calls Dave ""Bingo"" again, and when he tries to protest, he is interrupted by the harlequin shouting ""Music, please!"" again. The music begins playing again, and the screens also reappear, but are soon replaced by enormous, robotic faces. The balloon girl drifts away on a giant balloon, and a human-sized flea walks past with a sign announcing ""The Money Guy."" The harlequin returns briefly and orders the music to stop before disappearing. When the music stops, there is a strange creature with no legs, many arms, a man's head, and dollar bills sprouting from its neck and arms. It yells at Dave for ""looking at my money,"" but then offers to let Dave look at his money. Confused and frightened, Dave declares that yes, he would like to look at the creature's money. The creature congratulates him for being a ""good, little Bingo."" Dave says that he doesn't think that he's Bingo, asking ""who am I?"" The harlequin once again calls for music. This time, the lighting does not change, but the money creature is wheeled away as music plays and then fades out. Left alone, Dave says that maybe his is ""Bingo"" after all. The clown reappears, sitting in an easy chair, wearing glasses, with an axe embedded in his head. The clown asks Dave to confirm that he is ""Bingo the Clown."" Dave agrees, stating enthusiastically that he is ""Bingo, Bingo the Clown-o!"" He stands up and starts dancing around while shaking a baby's rattle. The lights come on, fully illuminating the room, and a voice on a loudspeaker says ""Thank you. Next."" The screen cuts to black, and the credits begin."

Wolf is in his cave watching a baseball game on TV. Suddenly his wife burst in and demands he hunt a rabbit. Charles goes right away, rifle in hand muttering he hates his wife, getting a skillet tossed at his head. Bugs Bunny catches Charles running and while running alongside, he asks him what the rush is. When asked if he's hunting for something, Charlie forgets what it is and Bugs openly guesses a rabbit. Charles shoots at Bugs, but Bugs dodges the shots and in a minute or two causes him to whack himself with his gun. Bugs tests the gun for any faults, but as he shoots Charles in the face, he concludes Charles is just a bad shot. Charles starts chasing Bugs around a tree and Bugs does another round of questions as Charles has forgotten its a rabbit he's after. As Charles recalls, Bugs trips him over. Bugs dives into his hole and leaves out a box. Charles finds inside it a hand grenade. Charlie reads a set of instructions to operate the grenade but takes too long after pulling the pin and it explodes in his face. Charles chases Bugs into a railroad tunnel. Charles runs out thinking a train is coming, but it's just Bugs holding a flashlight and blowing into a whistle. Having wised up, Charlie chases Bugs back into the tunnel, but a real train comes out of the tunnel and runs him over. Charles wonders why he ever wanted to catch a train. Out of his hole, Bugs lights a nearby fuse and Charles curiously follows it. At the end of the fuse, Charles gets in the way of an explosive gunpowder keg, which blows up. Bugs then builds a door on a plank of wood stretching out from a cliff. Charles demands to be let in and when Bugs refuses, he burst in and plummets off the cliff lying on the falling door. As Charles crashes into the ravine below, the impact makes Bugs almost fall off the plank, but Bugs manages to save himself. Charles rushes back up to Bugs and breathes heavily on Bugs' fur. Once again Charles forgets what he came after. This time Bugs then decides not to remind him and tells Charlie to let him know when he finally finds out, leaving Charlie to continue to guess. Hours later into the night, way past dinnertime, Charlie is sitting on a rock, still trying to figure out what he wants. Bugs emerges from his hole in his night attire, holding a candle and he bids the audience goodnight.

However, as he is about to pay for the passes, he realises his mistake, adds his own 3,000 rupees to the bundle and returns it to Ramulu. Meanwhile, a group of terrorists come to the ward housing Qureshi and free their leader. They leave Qureshi unharmed on account of his being a Muslim and start the terrorist attack.

The grave robber sneaks into a crypt and immediately searches through a coffin for valuables. He nonchalantly removes and steals a ring from the decaying finger of the skeleton in the tomb. He reaches inside once more, but an unknown force slams the coffin's cover closed, cutting off one of his hands in the process. In terror, the robber watches as the exit of the crypt is being closed off, trapping him. It then switches to present day, where a man with the name of Perry is being released from prison. His girlfriend, PJ, waits for him in a car nearby. Three other girls, Dorian, Adriana, and Morgan, are on their way to go meet them, but need to steal a car. They are driving away when the real owner of the stolen car shoots at them. They cheer as they drive away unscathed, only to realize that Adriana's brother was shot in the head and killed. Although hysterical, they continue to drive to meet the others. They all meet and a thief, Gina, tells them about a ""job of the century"" that would get them easy money. She explains of underground vaults built during the Great Depression that became burial chambers for the wealthy. She shows them a gold ring and tells them there is more treasure hidden in the crypt down below. Equipped with backpacks, tools, two-way radios, and head-mounted flashlights, the group breaks into the north end of the crypt. PJ immediately notices something strange in the crypt when her backpack's contents are taken out after leaving it for only a few seconds. Gina begins to travel ahead to check through the crypt and immediately begins to see ghost-like figures. Regardless, the group open a tomb and take the treasure. When Gina leans to steal off a necklace from one of the skeletons, she jumps in fright, claiming to have seen it ""open its eyes."" They find several boxes of jewelry and begin to marvel in its excess. When no one is looking, Gina slips a necklace into her bra. Suddenly, they hear something that sounded like an earthquake and realize they are caved in. They try to find another way out but ultimately decide to dig their way out. The three girls decide to turn back while PJ, Perry, and Gina decide to keep going. The girls need to crawl under a wall in order to get back out. However, Morgan decides to climb over and an unstable wall falls on her, crushing her skull and killing her. Shocked by Morgan's death, they decided to crawl back out but Adriana and Dorian saw an undead under the wall trapping them. Adriana starts to panic and Dorian climbs the wall to reach the opening in order to get back out but accidentally falls on the other side leaving Adriana behind. Gina splits off from Perry and PJ, who go into a vault and somehow become locked in. They follow a tunnel that leads to another room. Inside, Perry is attacked by one of the undead. In fear, PJ runs out of the tunnel and out the door that had locked them in before. She locks the door behind her and runs to find the others. PJ goes back to find the others only to find Morgan dead and Adriana trapped on the other side of the unstable wall, while PJ gets Adriana, Gina locates the injured Dorian who broke her ankle and needs assistance in order to walk. The girls meet at a certain point and decide to leave through crawling in a tunnel. However, while crawling through the tunnel, Adriana is dragged away by one of the undead. Adriana's loss makes Dorian depressed. Gina heads to another route to find an exit leaving PJ and Dorian. The undead attacks them and Dorian is choked to death by the same ghost figure that had choked Perry. Gina and PJ continue forward but Gina reluctantly admits that she had been down in the crypts before. She explains that she was unable to find any jewelry and the ghost-like figures had never attacked her before; only watched. They leave behind the backpacks of jewelry and are able to escape through the other exit unscathed. They return to their homes. Gina finds the necklace that she had hid in her bra. She brings it over to PJ's and tries to give it as a gift. However, PJ is furious and tells her to get it out. Gina keeps the bracelet and that night she is killed by the same figure that killed Dorian. PJ has a nightmare that Perry had become one of the undead and decides to go back down the crypts to rescue him. PJ travels back down the crypts until she reaches the door she locked. She opens it and sees Perry, barely alive. PJ begins to put all the jewelry back into its box and asks Perry if it was all the jewelry they had stolen. She then throws the jewelry back into the crypt. She attempts to help Perry out, but he is too weak to walk. When he gestures for her to go without him, she sees a ring on his finger. The ring is from the crypt. Before she could say anything, the undead comes and tortuously kills Perry right before PJ's eyes."

Sicilian magnate Don Luciano  and his wife Graziella  live comfortably at Villa Rosa in Palermo, Italy. Their son Michael  has an affair with Sophia , leaving her pregnant but unmarried. After Luciano refuses to traffic drugs, angry U.S. mob boss Carolla  retaliates by having Michael killed. While at a convent, Sophia's given a hard blow when another pregnant woman tells her of his death, she almost immediately gives birth to Luka, Michael's son. Living at the convent, but determined to keep her son, she goes alone by herself to confront the Luciano family for money to support her son. However, the Luciano's are still cooping with Michael's death and refuse admission to anyone, unless its family or those that work for them, through the gates. Despite the guard's insistence, Sophia still continues to try to seek an audience with them. Only to be violently handled by the guards and almost thrown on the road. One of Michael's brothers, Constantino, taking pity on her, lets her in. He and his mother, Graziella, nurse the tired Sophia. During her time there, she and Constantino fall in love. However, none of the Lucianos, including Constantino, know of her being Michael's former lover or of her son's existence. Roberto , sees Constantino's affections for Sophia and makes it clear to his wife that he doesn't approve of her, mostly due to being poor and considered lower class. However, Graziella eventually gets her husband to understand Sophia and accept her. While the engagement is good news, Sophia secretly learns something devastating. Because she spent so long at the Lucianos and took too long of time to contact the convent, the nuns had to treat her son as an orphan and gave him up for adoption. Sophia still keeps this a secret. She eventually recovers and marries Constantino. The story begins to show some of the other brothers, Alfredo  the one who constantly hopes to please their father and Fredrico , who is something of a troublemaker and doesn't like being told what to do. Teresa Scorpio , daughter of Mrs. Scorpio, owner of a highly successful business in New York, is chosen by Graziella for Fredrico to marry. But Fredrico is openly opposed to it. Despite, his objections, he and Alfredo are sent to New York to meet with her. Fredrico happily sees Moyra , the former girlfriend of an American casino owner, Nicky Diamond. After still remembering his one-time with Moyra, Fredrico blows off his ""date"" with Teresa. Alfredo, reluctantly goes in Fredrico's place. Both men fall in love with the women, during their dates. Alfredo and Teresa marry and stay in America to run her family business. During the wedding, it is clear that Sophia is feeling unhappy in her marriage, though mostly because everyone, including Graziella, is pressuring the couple into having children. While the couple have been trying, they've had no luck with conceiving. Fredrico makes a surprise appearance at the wedding with Moyra ; this clearly appalls Roberto, seeing her as a tramp. At the wedding reception, Roberto pulls his son aside and angrily demands he kick Moyra out and meet a nice girl that Graziella has picked and that this time he won't refuse. However, both he and Moyra argue loudly about leaving. Sophia comes to the couple, attempting to quiet down the argument. But Moyra has had enough of keeping quiet and loudly announces that she and Fredrico are married and is pregnant with his son. Tired of being treated badly, she therefore announces she won't have the baby without the Luciano family support it. However, this triggers her to go into labor. She loses the baby, most likely due to either her smoking and drinking. She tells Sophia in her hospital room ""I had a son, perfect in every way, he just wasn't breathing"". She cries to Sophia out of worry that Fredrico will divorce her because she lost the baby. After directing Fredrico to Moyra's room, she and Constantino have a small disagreement because his family clearly disapprove of Moyra. Coming from lower class like Moyra, Sophia stands up for her but during this she breaks down. She sobs due to her inability to conceive and also, secretly still missing her son. During that same night, she attempts to ask one of the nuns where her son is. Sophia, once again faces more heart-breaking news, that her son and his adopted parents were apparently killed. Again, unknown to all, still believing she's depressed over her inability to conceive, Roberto decides to cheer up his daughter-in-law by giving her money to start her own boutique and fashion. Over the years, Teresa and Alfredo have a daughter named Rosa , Moyra's accepted into the family, and Sophia's boutiques have become very popular. She and Constantino also gain wonderful news, she's pregnant. She soon gives birth to twin sons, named Roberto and Nunico. Elsewhere, Sophia's son called Luka , is revealed to be alive. But he's a violent child  and is almost feral with the monks who tend to him. He eventually befriends a sickly young man named Giorgio , the son of Pietro Carolla. Over the years, he and Luka develop a brotherly friendship. However, Luka's violence and personality hasn't changed that much, much to Giorgio's dismay. Giorgio soon dies, but makes his father promise to look out for Luka. To appease his son's dying wish, Pietro adopts Luka, not knowing of Luka's sociopath-like personality. Not too long after, the Lucianos are finally able to have Pietro arrested and face trial for Michael Luciano's murder. Rosa is also expected to marry a young man, close to Roberto's family. Believing their family is finally getting closure, all of the Luciano men  go out for dinner to celebrate. Meanwhile, back at the Villa, the women are helping Rosa prepare her wedding dress. Unknown to all, the sadistic Luka, along with Carolla's men, decide to get their own revenge. Carolla's allies have the men's wine poisoned, making it seemingly appear like they had heart-attacks. Luka sneaks onto the Villa and cruelly and quietly shoots Sophia's sons while they were in bed; not knowing he's murdering his own family. The women are struck with grief and mostly anger for what has happened and vow revenge. It won't be an easy road, as apparently they lose all their money . Mario Domino  commits suicide. There are threats of Carolla's men. Luka goes to his father, proudly admitting he killed Sophia's sons to please him. Pietro is greatly disgusted by Luka's sadistic side and curses him. The next day, during Pietro's trial, the women plan to get their revenge and shoot him in court. But Luka, under a heavy disguise shots Pietro and escapes the courthouse. He is accidentally hit by the Luciano women's car during his escape. They tend to his wounds and befriend him, unknown to his connections to Carolla or for that matter his true connection to Sophia. Luka tells them he's an American. Over time he charms all the women and eventually gains Rosa's affections, but he still tries to seduce all the women, including Graziella and Sophia, not knowing of his genetic relation to them. During his stay, he gets back at some of Carolla's men by murdering one of the hitmen and placing him in their car. To gain some money back, Luka, Teresa, Grizella, Rosa, and Moyra go to Vegas to get money from her ex-boyfriend, Nicky Diamond. He and Moyra struggle, but Luka aggressively gets Nicky to tell them the combination to the lock of the safe. Moyra leaves with the money, not knowing that Luka has killed Nicky, and the women find that Graziella has oddly enough won a big lottery. Meanwhile, back in New York, Sophia befriends an apparent American mafia man named Vito Giancamo and his son Michael . While Michael is interested in Sophia, Sophia politely declines Vito's offer and instead offers Rosa as his fiancée. Through Sophia's persuasion, Vito agrees and Michael is soon arranged to be engaged to Rosa. Not long after getting that settled, the police come to her and reveal Luka's true identity and that he's murdered several people, including the American whose name he used. Realizing he's responsible for the men's death, she goes to Carolla's mansion and prepares a poisoned meal for him. When Luka arrives with the women, she informs them of his identity and they all help her serve him the poisoned food and wine. As he becomes weak, the women immediately bind him to his chair and confront him. He shows no remorse for the deeds, including killing the children. The women all leave the room and wait for the poison to kill him. Rosa, still apparently having feelings for him, tries to show him mercy or pity. Luka, is ungrateful and spits in her face, leaving her heartbroken to see his true colors. Sophia, deciding to face him, stays by his side as he is dying. After a somewhat disturbing moment between them, she eventually stabs Luka out of rage. After she does, she sees the necklace she had once left with her son. Before Luka dies, she begs him to demand where he got it from, with his dying breath, he says his mother left it to him. Sophia is shattered to discover that Luka is her son, and that she has murdered him. Afterwards, the women burn his body and her clothes, in Carolla's backyard. They do not know that Luka was Sophia's son, but know that Sophia was the one with his blood on her hands. Graziella makes Sophia the new head of the family. The scene then goes to show Rosa and Michael's wedding, with the women celebrating with many guests, including Carolla's allies. As Sophia and Teresa watch the young couple, it is revealed the women plan to finish out their revenge on Carolla's allies who helped murder their husbands. The Giancamo family will remain in the dark about it. Moyra eventually comes to Sophia, with the poisoned wine glass for Victor Muzetti  one of Carolla's men. It is hinted that Moyra may marry Vito Giancamo, since he's a widower, mostly through Sophia's encouragement that he'll take care of her. As Sophia watches Muzetti leave , she goes to a table. Nostalgically looking at Michael's picture, she soon opens it and it is revealed to have another photo behind it. The photo has all of Carolla's men, crossing Muzetti's face first. The movie ends with her staring into camera with her eyes, ones the men call the ""devil's eyes""."

She and Constantino also gain wonderful news, she's pregnant. She soon gives birth to twin sons, named Roberto and Nunico. Elsewhere, Sophia's son called Luka , is revealed to be alive. But he's a violent child  and is almost feral with the monks who tend to him. He eventually befriends a sickly young man named Giorgio , the son of Pietro Carolla. Over the years, he and Luka develop a brotherly friendship. However, Luka's violence and personality hasn't changed that much, much to Giorgio's dismay. Giorgio soon dies, but makes his father promise to look out for Luka. To appease his son's dying wish, Pietro adopts Luka, not knowing of Luka's sociopath-like personality. Not too long after, the Lucianos are finally able to have Pietro arrested and face trial for Michael Luciano's murder. Rosa is also expected to marry a young man, close to Roberto's family. Believing their family is finally getting closure, all of the Luciano men  go out for dinner to celebrate. Meanwhile, back at the Villa, the women are helping Rosa prepare her wedding dress. Unknown to all, the sadistic Luka, along with Carolla's men, decide to get their own revenge. Carolla's allies have the men's wine poisoned, making it seemingly appear like they had heart-attacks. Luka sneaks onto the Villa and cruelly and quietly shoots Sophia's sons while they were in bed; not knowing he's murdering his own family. The women are struck with grief and mostly anger for what has happened and vow revenge. It won't be an easy road, as apparently they lose all their money . Mario Domino  commits suicide. There are threats of Carolla's men. Luka goes to his father, proudly admitting he killed Sophia's sons to please him. Pietro is greatly disgusted by Luka's sadistic side and curses him. The next day, during Pietro's trial, the women plan to get their revenge and shoot him in court. But Luka, under a heavy disguise shots Pietro and escapes the courthouse. He is accidentally hit by the Luciano women's car during his escape. They tend to his wounds and befriend him, unknown to his connections to Carolla or for that matter his true connection to Sophia. Luka tells them he's an American. Over time he charms all the women and eventually gains Rosa's affections, but he still tries to seduce all the women, including Graziella and Sophia, not knowing of his genetic relation to them. During his stay, he gets back at some of Carolla's men by murdering one of the hitmen and placing him in their car. To gain some money back, Luka, Teresa, Grizella, Rosa, and Moyra go to Vegas to get money from her ex-boyfriend, Nicky Diamond. He and Moyra struggle, but Luka aggressively gets Nicky to tell them the combination to the lock of the safe. Moyra leaves with the money, not knowing that Luka has killed Nicky, and the women find that Graziella has oddly enough won a big lottery. Meanwhile, back in New York, Sophia befriends an apparent American mafia man named Vito Giancamo and his son Michael . While Michael is interested in Sophia, Sophia politely declines Vito's offer and instead offers Rosa as his fiancée. Through Sophia's persuasion, Vito agrees and Michael is soon arranged to be engaged to Rosa. Not long after getting that settled, the police come to her and reveal Luka's true identity and that he's murdered several people, including the American whose name he used. Realizing he's responsible for the men's death, she goes to Carolla's mansion and prepares a poisoned meal for him. When Luka arrives with the women, she informs them of his identity and they all help her serve him the poisoned food and wine. As he becomes weak, the women immediately bind him to his chair and confront him. He shows no remorse for the deeds, including killing the children. The women all leave the room and wait for the poison to kill him. Rosa, still apparently having feelings for him, tries to show him mercy or pity. Luka, is ungrateful and spits in her face, leaving her heartbroken to see his true colors. Sophia, deciding to face him, stays by his side as he is dying. After a somewhat disturbing moment between them, she eventually stabs Luka out of rage. After she does, she sees the necklace she had once left with her son. Before Luka dies, she begs him to demand where he got it from, with his dying breath, he says his mother left it to him. Sophia is shattered to discover that Luka is her son, and that she has murdered him. Afterwards, the women burn his body and her clothes, in Carolla's backyard. They do not know that Luka was Sophia's son, but know that Sophia was the one with his blood on her hands. Graziella makes Sophia the new head of the family. The scene then goes to show Rosa and Michael's wedding, with the women celebrating with many guests, including Carolla's allies. As Sophia and Teresa watch the young couple, it is revealed the women plan to finish out their revenge on Carolla's allies who helped murder their husbands. The Giancamo family will remain in the dark about it. Moyra eventually comes to Sophia, with the poisoned wine glass for Victor Muzetti  one of Carolla's men. It is hinted that Moyra may marry Vito Giancamo, since he's a widower, mostly through Sophia's encouragement that he'll take care of her. As Sophia watches Muzetti leave , she goes to a table. Nostalgically looking at Michael's picture, she soon opens it and it is revealed to have another photo behind it. The photo has all of Carolla's men, crossing Muzetti's face first. The movie ends with her staring into camera with her eyes, ones the men call the ""devil's eyes""."

Moore then uses an Encyclopædia Britannica archive video to compare modern-day America with the Roman Empire. The film then depicts home videos of families being evicted from their homes, as well as the ""Condo Vultures,"" a Florida real estate agency whose business flourished with the increasing number of foreclosures. The film then cuts back to the past ""golden days"" of American capitalism following World War II, followed by a ""bummer"" speech by President Jimmy Carter warning Americans of the dangers of worshiping ""self-indulgence and consumption"". In the following Ronald Reagan years where the policies of Don Regan ""turned the bull loose"" for free enterprises, corporations gained more political power, unions were weakened, and socioeconomic gaps were widened. Moore suggests that Reagan was favored for his charisma and communication skills rather than effective leadership, and highlights one of Reagan's speeches in which Regan, somewhat indiscreetly, orders Reagan to ""speed it up"", and Reagan quickly obeys. The film then cuts to the kids for cash scandal, Captain Chesley Sullenberger's congressional testimony regarding airline pilots' poor treatment, and coverage of ""dead peasant insurance"" policies, where companies such as Wal-Mart have insurance against losses caused when workers or suppliers die. Moore then interviews several Catholic priests, including Bishop Thomas Gumbleton , all of whom consider capitalism a ""radical evil"" contrary to the teachings of Christianity. The film then presents a parody of what would happen if Jesus was a capitalist who wanted to ""maximize profits,"" ""deregulate the banking industry,"" and wanted the sick to ""pay out of pocket"" for their ""pre-existing condition"" (via clips from the 1977 miniseries [[Jesus of Nazareth , in contrast with several news pundits who proclaim the success of various capitalist enterprises as being a ""blessing from God."" After referring to Dr. Jonas Salk, who for the public good, selflessly refused to patent the polio vaccine , Moore wonders about how the brightest of America's young generation are attracted into finance instead of science. Moore then goes to Wall Street seeking technical explanation about derivatives and credit default swaps, only to be advised ""don't make any more movies"". Eventually Marcus Haupt, a former VP of Lehman Brothers, agrees to help but fails at clearly explaining these terms. Harvard professor Kenneth Rogoff similarly fails. Moore eventually concludes that the complex system and terminology are merely there to confuse and ""get away with murder"", and Wall Street is just ""an insane casino."" Moore then explores the role of Alan Greenspan and the U.S. Treasury in leading up to the United States housing bubble that devastated the American middle class. Moore also interviews a former employee at Countrywide Financial responsible for their VIP program for ""FOAs"" and details how many members of Congress and political figures received favorable mortgage rates under the program. Moore then discusses with William Black, who analogizes the situation to the build-up of the collapse of a dam. The film then shows the series of events leading up to the passing of the 2008 bailout proposed by Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson . Moore then speaks with several Members of Congress, including Ohio congresswoman Marcy Kaptur, who agrees with Moore's comment that the passing of the bailout was a ""financial coup d'état"". Moore interviews Elizabeth Warren, the head of the US Congressional Oversight Committee, the government agency serving as a watchdog for Congress' wrongdoing. He asks her, ""Where's our money?"", referring to the $700 billion bailout money which Congress gave to the big banks and Wall Street investment companies. Warren replies, ""I don't know."" Advised by Warren to contact Paulson's office for answers, Moore's call is promptly disconnected upon recognition of his identity. He then goes to Wall Street demanding to ""get the money back for the American people"", but is denied entry into every office building of the major banks. The documentary features a number of positive portrayals, which include bailout watchdog Elizabeth Warren, Wayne County Sheriff Warren Evans, who put forth a moratorium on home evictions, and Ohio Representative Marcy Kaptur, who on the floor of the US Congress encouraged Americans to be ""squatters"" in their own homes, and refuse to vacate.<ref namehttp://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/02/michael-moore/michael-moore-says-young-people-are-increasingly-w/|titleOctober 2, 2009|firstJacobson|workYoung | firstFilm Review: Capitalism: A Love Story | workhttp://www.filmjournal.com/filmjournal/content_display/reviews/major-releases/e3i2a62ee6983153e305592f2a0419f9dff | datePrometheus Global Media | accessdateNew York, New York}}"

The room which they share looks like a dark cellar with a dripping sewer pipe running through it. One of the prisoners seems to be delirious and never stops talking. In order to cheer up his inmate, he tells lewd stories of his past, does some push-ups, comes up with crazy ideas and even mimics a heron only to make his companion go absolutely mad at him. The clumsy talker receives a violent beating from the enraged prisoner.The angry officer is then taken from the cell by a guard to clean up a dirty toilet bowl with a fork. Some time later, after a sleep the insane officer defecates in the only plate both share for eating , smears feces over his belly and devours a large portion of it. After doing so he offers a plate with the fecal matter to the other man right after he wakes up and drives him mad again. The two main characters go through a series of humiliating acts conducted by a guard and a captain who seems to have a strong sadistic streak.

While they are getting ready at a mirror they begin to discuss life and romance. The story then catapults itself into the past before the two women met and where their story really begins. Quirky Cora is an aspiring biochemist with intention to go to university but ends up taking a jump towards late teenage rebellion in which she tries drugs, drinks excessively. After moving in with her boyfriend, Cora discovers she's pregnant and immediately all her dreams are shattered as she becomes a pregnant housewife who is eventually dumped by her passionate but slovenly boyfriend. Ellen on the other hand is strait-laced and level-headed; A budding cartoonist with prospects to run her own business alongside her colleague Stanley . While out for a drink at her local pub, womanizing Daniel , makes a pass at her and she is instantly smitten. Ellen invites Daniel to meet her very prim and proper mother who is instantly reviled by Daniel's revelation that he is writing a dissertation on the post-coital discussions women have with men after sleeping with them. Despite her mother's attempt to talk Ellen into dumping Daniel, Ellen decides to accept Daniel's marriage proposal and soon weds him, delighted with his wedding gift of a purple velvet Victorian style couch. Not long into their marriage Ellen's hopes of a having a family are forced out of the picture when Daniel reveals he doesn't want children. Despite being married, Daniel is still womanizing and gambling excessively . After a confrontation with Daniel after she discovers he has been cheating on her, Ellen walks out and goes to the pub to think things over where she meets heavily pregnant Cora. Despite their obvious differences immediately become friends and Ellen even becomes Cora's coach as she goes into hospital to give birth to her son Sam. A year and a half later, Cora is given a night of freedom from her children when her parents offer to babysit, and she goes to the pub from which she calls Ellen's house to try and convince her friend to join her; Daniel however picks up the phone as Ellen is out. Daniel shows up at the pub to deliberately seduce Cora fully aware that the woman doesn't know what he looks like. After the one night stand, Cora is horrified when Daniel turns up at the café where she works and kisses Ellen in front of her; even more horrifying is the realization she has become pregnant once again, this time to her best-friend's husband. Although Cora decides to keep the child, Daniel decides he wants nothing to do with her, and refuses to even pay maintenance, leaving Cora once again a single mother with no additional income. Years pass, and Ellen and Daniel are going through a rather messy divorce which is left slightly easier by the fact he has taken off to Barbados. Regardless of the hurt he has caused her, Ellen is still undeniably in love with him and still fully unaware that her best friend's youngest son Col is the son of her husband. Cora on the other hand is struggling with life still, and still depressed over the horrible guilt she has never been able to reveal to her friend the truth of her son's paternity. After Daniel makes a return, Cora realises that she is running out of time to tell Ellen the truth and all her friends and neighbours who are fully aware of what Cora done years before urge her to be honest. While throwing a dinner party at her loft home, Ellen, Cora and some close neighbours become blindingly drunk, in which Cora finally confesses the truth at the dinner table. Humiliated, Ellen throws everyone out including Cora, and locks herself in her flat for days, becoming horribly depressed over the fact Cora had the son with Daniel that she herself had always wanted to have. Daniel returns to Ellen following the dinner party although he finds immediately that he is unwelcome and Ellen doesn't want anything to do with him anymore. In the meantime, Cora develops a relationship with Ellen's co-worker Stanley and begins to feel more confident within herself and what she wants from life after a near-death experience. Finally she works up the courage to go to Ellen and apologise. Regardless of their row, the two women manage to come to a mutual understanding just as Daniel bursts into the flat with a friend to remove the velvet couch he had given Ellen as a wedding present. After an argument between both women and Daniel ensues, Ellen forfeits the couch and throws Daniel and his friend out, immediately afterwards retrieving a bag from a cupboard which contains £25,000 which Daniel had won from gambling and stashed in the flat. Ellen splits the money, giving £13,000 of it to Cora to pay the maintenance Daniel had never paid for Col, and she takes the remaining money to the Book-keepers where she bets the lot on a no-chance horse. Seconds after leaving the Book-keepers she is approached by Daniel who has realised his mistake and is demanding his money back; Ellen hands him the betting slip and walks away with Cora, having finally got her revenge on him.

The dragons wreak havoc on the surrounding medieval countryside and two rival monarchs, King Fastrad  and King Wednesbury  must join forces to face the threat. A messenger arrives to warn King Fastrad who does not believe him, until the dragons make their appearance and destroy his fiefdom.

Another officer approaches him and informs him that he is needed at a recent crime scene, and they depart immediately. Varma arrives at the home of Ouseppachan ([[Janardhanan , a local businessman, and sees the body of Ouseppachan's daughter-in-law, Omana ([[Lizy  on the grounds behind the house, in an apparent suicide. He is then introduced to Omana's husband Sunny, her father-in-law Ouseppachan, Ouseppachan's son-in-law Johny ([[Vijayaraghavan , Ouseppachan's best friend Narayan, and several of the household servants and neighbors . The initial report conducted by the first responders concluded that Omana had committed suicide by flinging herself from the roof of the two-story house onto the stone pavement below. Varma questions the members of the household as well as neighbors and servants about Omana's relationship with her husband Sunny . Sunny admits to arguing with Omana the night she died and throwing her onto their bed before leaving to drink, but swears he never hit her. He also tells Varma that Omana had attempted suicide before. Ouseppachan claims he came home from a business trip that night, dropped off by his driver, Vasu , only to find himself locked out of the house. He decided to go around the back to where the cook's quarters were located when he stumbled upon Omana's body. Dissatisfied with inconsistent testimonies from several suspects, Varma immediately suspects foul play and is determined to find the truth. The next morning, the Regional Medical Officer  concludes that Omana died from head trauma at 8pm the previous night. Omana's cousin Chacko ([[Mukesh , a police officer working under Varma, finds this autopsy report suspicious and tells Varma and Officer Alex  why he has doubts to its accuracy. He informs them that it rained severely until 9:30pm the night Omana allegedly committed suicide, and if she had died at 8pm, her corpse would have been wet, and the blood from her injury would have been mixed in with the rain water. Alex, who is taking bribes from Ouseppachan, warns Ouseppachan to do what he can to get Varma and Chacko off the case. Sensing that Varma will cause him trouble, Ouseppachan implores his best friend, Narayanan , a local politician, to call his politician friends  to have Varma transferred off the case and onto Rural. They also managed to transfer Omana's cousin, Chacko to Traffic. A new Dy SP, Devadas , takes over the case. Devadas, who is also being bribed by Ouseppachan, intimidates Omana's grieving family and any witnesses that may implicate Ouseppachan or Sunny. He quickly concludes the investigation stating that Omana committed suicide. Omana's father Thomachan  and her sister Annie ([[Urvashi  are determined to seek justice for Omana. They implore the CBI to re-open the case and find the truth. The Director of the CBI assigns Sethuraman Iyer  to head the investigation. He is assisted by Sub-Inspector Harry  and Sub-Inspector Vikram . Iyer and his team find evidence of political interference in Omana's murder investigation, citing an increased amount of phone calls to Ministers and Party Leaders from Narayan's phone number, and thousands of rupees worth of cash withdrawals from Ouseppachan's bank that were never reported in the books. Iyer meets with Varma and Chacko who help him with his investigation by informing him of inconsistent testimony from suspects and the inconsistencies with the Regional Medical Examiner's autopsy report. Later that week, Iyer and his team bring two dummies the same height and weight as Omana to Ouseppachan's house. They take the dummies to roof and drop one straight down as if it jumped, and threw the other off the roof as if someone had thrown the body. They find that Omana's body landed approximately around the same place as the dummy that was thrown, and concluded that she could not have jumped that far off the roof on her own. Next, they decide to track down Ouseppachan's driver, Vasu, who has been missing since the morning after Omana's death. Harry finds out that Vasu had given a local banker some jewelry as collateral for a loan. Among the jewelry was a bracelet belonging to Omana, which immediately put all suspicion on Vasu. They finally find him and take him into custody, where he confesses that shortly after he got home after dropping off Ouseppachan the night of Omana's death, Narayan came to his house and told him that Sunny had accidentally killed Omana during a domestic dispute. Vasu then said Narayan and the others implored him to carry Omana's body from her bed to the roof and fling her off. It was during a moment alone with Omana's dead body that Vasu had noticed her gold bracelet and decided to steal it, before throwing her corpse of the roof. Despite Vasu's testimony implicating Sunny as the killer, Iyer is not convinced. Sunny had left the house at 8pm after hitting Omana and that would mean that she died at 8pm. However, Iyer examines photographs of the crime scene and finds that Omana still bled when she was dropped off the roof some 2 hours later, and since dead bodies do not retain heat thus causing the blood to clot, she could not have died at 8pm. Upon scrutinizing the photographs further, Iyer notices a small blood stain on Omana's saree below the waist. Since the autopsy report stated that she sustained no injuries below the waist, Iyer is convinced that the blood was left behind by the real killer. After testing the blood they find that it is O-negative, a rare blood type. Remembering that the town had imposed mandatory blood tests on all its citizens recently by the local authorities to combat malaria, Iyer goes to the Malaria Research Center and finds that the blood type was so rare that only two people in the entire town had it. In the final scene, Iyer arrives at Ouseppachan's house with a large police backup unit and places Ouseppachan under arrest for the murder of Omana. Shocked, Ouseppachan vehemently denies killing her, but Iyer would not relent. Seeing his father being arrested for a crime he committed, a guilt-ridden Sunny confesses to Iyer that he killed Omana accidentally by hitting her too hard when they fought. Iyer tells Sunny that Omana did not die when he hit her, that she only fainted. Iyer then goes on to explain the blood on Omana's saree, which did not match her own, was left behind by the real killer. He informs them that only two people in the entire town were O-negative and one of those two people is Johny, Ouseppachan's son-law. Confronted with evidence for his involvement, Johny confesses that he had come to the house the night Omana had died. Finding her passed out on the bed, he attempted to rape her, but when she woke up and started screaming, he suffocated her to death. In the process he accidentally cut himself and left his blood on her saree. Thomachan and Annie thank Iyer, Harry and Vikram for their hard work and dedication and bringing Omana's killer to justice. The movie ends with a reference to Sukumaran Kurup, a real life notorious fugitive wanted in India for murder, who to this day is still on the run.

When stopping for something to eat they meet two rednecks and when Graeme laughs with them they start tormenting him. They leave quickly and dent the rednecks' truck. At night, along the highway, they notice lights following them. Wrongly thinking the lights to be from the rednecks' dented truck they speed up, but it's actually a car that passes them and then crashes. They investigate the damaged car, and discover an alien named Paul , who is in desperate need of help. Although shocked by the appearance of Paul, Graeme agrees to give Paul a ride, but Clive  is displeased about not being consulted about the idea. Later, United States Secret Service Agent Lorenzo Zoil  arrives at the site of the crashed car and informs his mysterious female superior, called the ""Big Guy"", over the radio that he is closing in on Paul, and she recommends using local law enforcement as back-up. She then recruits two inept rookie agents, Haggard  and O'Reilly , to aid in his mission, without informing them about the nature of their target. Zoil assures the Big Guy he can handle the problem himself, but the rookies are employed anyway. Graeme, Clive and Paul pull into an RV park run by Ruth Buggs , a Christian fundamentalist, and her over-bearing father, Moses . The trio bond around their camp grill and Paul reveals that since he was captured by the government, he had been advising them in all manner of scientific and sociological achievements. Having divulged everything that he knows, Paul has outlived his usefulness as a receptacle of knowledge, thus his captors intended to surgically remove Paul's brain and harvest his stem cells, in an attempt to harness his physical abilities . With the help from a friend inside Area&nbsp;51, Paul sent an SOS to his home planet and was escaping to rendezvous with them. The next morning, Paul intentionally reveals himself to Ruth during a theological discussion which turns into an argument, and the trio are forced to kidnap her and make a hasty escape. Moses sees Paul while the alien is trying to collect Clive's passport , and, believing him to be a demon, grabs his shotgun and chases after them in his truck. Paul shatters Ruth's faith by sharing his knowledge of the universe via a telepathic link; at first horrified, Ruth suddenly becomes eager to sin, which her father had raised her to fear doing. She initially does not trust Paul, but he heals her left eye, in which she was blind from the age of four. When the foursome stop at a bar to rest, Ruth tries to make a phone call to her dad, but Zoil answers, as part of the operation to capture Paul. At the end of the phone call, in which Ruth gives no information, she runs into the rednecks, who show an ill-received interest in her. She evades them, and informs Graeme and Clive they need to leave. At this point, the rednecks run into the men again, and a fight starts. Moses is also at the bar, and he sees Ruth, but notices her eye. As he is so stunned, he fails to react and loses track of the trio as they dash for the RV. The rednecks chase them down, but Paul appears outside the RV. The two rednecks faint and they drive away. Later that night, Paul, Graeme, Ruth and Clive sit down together near an RV park. Ruth falls asleep but goes back to the RV. In the morning, Graeme and Clive find it difficult to hide Paul from a busy town. Paul goes into a comic book store with Clive as Graeme goes to pick up Ruth. Paul has to pose as a statue there while they wait. Meanwhile, Ruth was asked questions by Agent Zoil, but lied and said she knew nothing of a one-eyed girl or two British ""nerds"". She and Graeme then drive into town to pick up Clive and Paul, but Paul had been exposed after he was caught by O'Reilly. Clive and Paul jump into the RV and narrowly escape the town; Haggard and O'Reilly report to Zoil. The rookies are asked to return to the base, but they want to catch the alien themselves. Moses is also in town, still trying to steal Ruth back, so he chases the RV. Clive and Graeme stop to buy fireworks at a shop but end up stealing them after Clive realizes they have no more American money. Paul eventually reveals his intention to return to Tara Walton , a girl whose dog he crashed his ship on in 1947 and who subsequently saved his life, who is now an old woman. After spending her life being ridiculed for what she said she saw, Tara is grateful to see that Paul exists. She turns her gas cooker on to make tea, but is interrupted by Haggard and O'Reilly on one side of the house, and Zoil on the other. As the motley crew escapes and drives off with Paul, O'Reilly shoots at them, and the gas ignites, destroying Tara's house and killing O'Reilly. A winded Zoil attempts to follow, but Haggard takes off first, shooting at Moses, running him off the road and catching up to the RV. However, due to an error in judgement, Haggard accidentally drives off a cliff and is killed, leaving Zoil as the last remaining agent in pursuit. He reassures the Big Guy that he will have Paul within an hour, but she declares herself tired of waiting, and informs Zoil that she has ordered a military response. When Paul, Graeme, Clive, Ruth and Tara arrive at the rendezvous, they set off a signal and wait. Eventually, eerie orange lights show up over the surrounding trees, and everyone believes that it is Paul's rescue ship. However, it is an army helicopter, with the Big Guy  on board. As she and three troops move to shoot Paul, Zoil arrives, and it is revealed that he was Paul's inside contact who helped him to escape. Zoil disarms the men, but is shot in the shoulder by the Big Guy. Tara punches out the Big Guy, but Moses appears with his shotgun and mortally wounds Graeme while aiming at Paul. Paul heals him and collapses, briefly appearing to be dead before he quickly recovers; Moses proclaims this to be a miracle from God. The Big Guy regains consciousness, but is immediately crushed by the arriving alien ship. Paul begins to depart and informs Tara that she is coming with him to live a better life. He bids farewell to his friends, hoping to meet them again one day. Two years later, Graeme, Clive, Ruth and O'Reilly, who is revealed to have survived the explosion, are shown again at the Comic-Con convention, where Graeme and Clive are promoting Paul, their new hit novel."

Joshua Winthrop, the owner of the house, rushes through the poorly lit corridors of the house before unlocking a heavily locked door. He begins talking to the creature inside to calm her down but she then kills him. After the credits we get Randolph Carter and two of his university buddies, Howard and Joel, as he regales them with ghost stories. Randolph points out that they are sitting in the graveyard surrounding the haunted house of his tales . The story that Randolph had been telling them was of Joshua Winthrop and his demon daughter, Alyda Winthrop. Joel comes up with the idea to stay there overnight. Randolph and Howard go back to the university, leaving Joel to it. Soon a group of students decide to go there, two young lads fresh from the university football team, Bruce Weeks and John Babcock, and a couple of girls that they want to score with: one of which Howard is in love with, Wendy Barnes, and the other is in love  with Howard, her name is Tanya Heller. They go there and get set up in a room to tell each other ghost stories. Meanwhile Howard chases after Randolph to tell him that Joel never came back from the house, prompting Randolph to swing into action saying ""I'll get the flashlights"" with some degree of authority and urgency, despite not being too bothered about the missing student prior to that. Alyda Winthrop, the creature, begins stalking the four youngsters in her home, planning to kill them as she killed her father and Joel. Soon Joel's decapitated corpse is found hanging upside down, his blood dripping onto a plate of some sort, along with his head, that rolls across the floor to look at a half naked Wendy. Soon Randolph and Howard arrive at the house and Randolph discovers that the door has locked of its own accord upon their entry. Magic, he must be thinking. Howard runs off to the aid of his beloved and Tanya, while Randolph decides to study The Necronomicon. In it he finds a spell to unlock the door. He goes outside and enters the ground under a tree via the tomb of Joshua Winthrop. This tree, with the aid of Randolph and the book, snatches Alyda from the house in the climax of the film, with Howard and Tanya being the only two left alive and in the desperately terrifying vicinity of the demon female. Howard and Tanya flee from the house and run to a safe distance, but a hand comes up from the ground and begins pulling Howard down. It is Randolph coming up from the catacombs beneath having fended off the skeleton guardians."

Howard is being wheeled into an ambulance because he has three deep gashes in his chest, Tanya is put into a police car, and Randolph is carrying Joshua Winthrop's book of spells, which he gives to Howard for safe keeping. Randolph confronts the Dean of the university about the house, who tells him not to dabble in things that he could never understand. Then Randolph goes to Professor Warren, who agrees to help. Howard is dragged along and the three go the spot where Randolph erupted from the ground in the first film. Howard is to stay near the car to keep guard. Eventually, Warren and Carter find Alyda, Joshua Winthrop's demon daughter  wrapped up in the roots of the tree that dragged Alyda out from the house in the first film. Warren injects the monstrous being with insulin to rid her body of the demon. This plan works, and she transforms into a beautiful woman, naked and wrapped in the tree roots. She is given sugar to bring her out of the insulin overdose, and the pair free her from her bonds. The demon is still in the caves, though, and it begins to hunt Alyda down so that they can be one again. After a showdown in the Arkham Library, Randolph manages to defeat the demon, but Alyda dies simultaneously.

Her sister Jeong-Eon sees her jump. The next day we see Jeong-Eon, So-Hee, Yoo-jin, and Joo-yeon in the office of the school, each swearing that they were meeting Joo-yeon in the meeting room, and that Eon-Joo wandered off to go to the restroom, then jumped off the roof of the school. So-Hee is the only student to admit she was on the roof when Eon-Joo jumped. Each of the three girls become very paranoid about the death of Eon-Joo, and secrets about why each girl had a reason to jump start to surface. We see that So-Hee is beginning to become very depressed about the death, unlike the other two. During the funeral of Eon-Joo we see So-Hee leaving the funeral crying. Jeong-Eon catches So-Hee before she leaves, confronting her about the death of Eon-Joo. So-Hee repeats that she doesn't know what happened and leaves. Meanwhile, rumors start to spread around the school. Many girls accuse So-Hee of killing Eon-Joo, since their relationship had become strained from the past year. Another girl claims that Eon-Joo killed herself because she was pregnant. In the next scene the three girls are seen in a corner of the school, accusing each other of spreading rumors, which each girl denies. Joo-yeon screams, claiming she saw Eon-Joo watching them. That evening Joo-yeon is lying awake in bed terrified, and her father comes in and beats her for having low grades. The next day she attends school with an eye patch over her left eye. Later, Joo-yeon is in the bathroom speaking to two girls who are gossiping about Eon-Joo's death. Joo-yeon sees Eon-Joo standing in an open bathroom stall, the left side of her face bloody and cracked. Joo-yeon runs to Yoo-jin while in class and screams that she has seen Eon-Joo in the bathroom. While Yoo-jin comforts her, Joo-yeon sees Eon-Joo again outside the window, screams, and wets herself. After a small fight Joo-yeon grabs her stuff, claiming to go to the teacher. Yoo-jin locks up Joo-yeon claiming she knows too much, and goes to computer class. Joo-yeon is screaming for Yoo-jin, when she sees someone outside the door. It turns out to be Eon-Joo, and she screams. We then see Yoo-jin in the computer room. The screens go black and Yoo-jin's screen shows Eon-Joo standing over Joo-yeon, who is curled up. Yoo-jin goes to rescue Joo-yeon and finds her in the bathroom, washing the urine off of her leg. Yoo-jin asks who let Joo-yeon out and she tells her Eon-Joo let her out, and Eon-Joo promised to not kill any of them if they come clean. Later Joo-yeon jumps off the roof. Yoo-jin and So-Hee watch her jump, both begging her not to jump. So-Hee is then seen holding Joo-yeon. So-Hee is asked by the faculty what happened, but So-Hee cannot speak. Later on So-Hee begs Yoo-jin to let her confess. Yoo-jin storms out of the classroom, and So-Hee stays behind seeing Eon-Joo. Eon-Joo turns So-Hee's head around to look at her and So-Hee screams. Yoo-jin runs back to check on So-Hee, and then asks her to go to the church to attempt to apologize. Before going to the church Yoo-jin attempts to take the church key that used to belong to her before Eon-Joo beat her in grades. Jeong-Eon asks Yoo-jin if she is ""looking for this"" and holds up the key. Jeong-Eon tells Yoo-jin that she knows that she was up on the roof when Eon-Joo was there. Yoo-jin asks why she knows that, and Jeong-Eon responds ""Eon-Joo told me, she told me everything!"" Yoo-jin hits Jeong-Eon with a statue and leaves, but we see that Jeong-Eon was just knocked out. Inside the church, So-Hee enters the confession box, and Yoo-jin pretends to enter hers. However, Yoo-jin goes into So-Hee's box attempts to strangle So-Hee. She smiles and says ""Do you want to know why we asked you to kill yourself with us?"" A flashback shows So-Hee with her boyfriend, Ki-Ho. We are shown that Yoo-jin used to date Ki-Ho and immediately made So-Hee and Joo-yeon stop being friends with Eon-Joo, despite So-Hee being such great friends with Eon-Joo. Eon-Joo had even told So-Hee that she wanted to die together with So-Hee one day, and regardless of this, she was no longer allowed to talk to Eon-Joo. However, on the day of So-Hee’s suicide, So-Hee called Eon-Joo to the library and told her that she was sorry for everything and confessed her pregnancy. So-Hee swore that she was going to kill herself and take the baby with her, and Eon-Joo agreed to die along with So-Hee no matter what. We then flash ahead to see Yoo-Jin pacing in the church, claiming to So-Hee and Joo-yeon that she would kill herself if she didn't make top grades. Not because she was terrified of losing the key, but losing to somebody in general. Joo-yeon sits up and says ""Suicide isn't funny. I tried to kill myself last year because of my dad."" So-Hee then confesses her pregnancy. Later we see Joo-yeon and Yoo-jin in a bedroom. Yoo-jin suggests that because So-Hee is better at school work than Yoo-jin, she doesn't want to lose to So-Hee again. Yoo-jin and Joo-yeon decide that they would pretend to jump. Yoo-jin drags So-Hee to the front of the church, tying a microphone around So-Hee's neck and stringing her high up. Just then a girl storms in screaming Yoo-jin's name. Yoo-jin asks ""Which one are you? Joo-yeon or Eon-Joo?"" It turns out to be Eon-Joo, who chases Yoo-jin to the back of the church; Eon-Joo catches her, and strangles Yoo-jin. Eon-Joo steps forward to So-Hee, while So-Hee screams. We then see a flashback of the four girls on the roof, each girl holding hands. Before the jump, Joo-yeon and Yoo-jin step back, accidentally pulling So-Hee with, but So-Hee accidentally let go of Eon-Joo's hand, and she Eon-Joo fell to her death. The next scene is of So-Hee crying and hugging Eon-Joo on the roof. Eon-Joo just smiles and says she missed So-Hee so much, and that she wanted to return, but knew she would scare So-Hee. Eon-Joo tells So-Hee she can no longer return while So-Hee begs Eon-Joo to take her with her. However, Jeong-Eon grabs Eon-Joo's hand, and Eon-Joo tells So-Hee that she must stay to take care of Jeong-Eon and that So-Hee is now Jeong-Eon's older sister. In the final scene we see that So-Hee is keeping the baby and Ki-Ho has moved on with a short-haired girl. The two step into an elevator, and as the door is closing, we see the girl's face turn into Eon-Joo's."

The two become fascinated with each other, but don't immediately start an affair. She doesn't want to destroy his greatest appeal, which is that he is upright and reliable. They eventually attempt some meetings, but something always goes wrong. Either he arrives late and the children are coming, or he ejaculates prematurely.

But before they manage to have sex, his wife surprises him by showing up also! Katrien escapes to an adjacent room through an interconnecting door and Simon and his wife make violent love, which Katrien hears through the wall, and she gets upset because they were just about to have sex and he is having sex with his wife.

Director Amy Grill follows a series of characters  over a number of years as some struggle to make it while others thrive in the world of electronic music. The film reveals six intertwined character studies and raw vérité views of new music. It's a window into a world filled with warehouse parties, endless gigs, international travel, risks, inventions, triumphs and breakdowns. The characters are: Modeselektor, a producer duo, jettisoned from playing a tiny room in the US to playing to 20,000 people at the Sónar festival in Barcelona; journalist Philip Sherburne, who leaves America to find a more complete techno lifestyle in Europe; The Wighnomy Brothers, catapulted from their idyllic world in Jena, Germany to face their breaking point on camera; Tobias Thomas of Kompakt, who contemplates the near-end of his career; and Monolake, an inventor of the Ableton software that nearly all electronic musicians use to create their music, who continues his steady yet quirky approach to a life in music. While back in the US, David Day  tries tirelessly to turn Boston from a rock-centric town to a techno city. Day's wanton attempts to make electronic music popular put strain on his marriage to the director.

Tom prefers classical music, reads Candide, goes to the theater, and generally seems to be more at ease in the company of women. The other boys torment Tom for his ""unmanly"" qualities and call him ""sister boy,"" and he is treated unfeelingly by his father, Herb Lee, who believes a man should be manly and that his son should fit in with the other boys. Only Al, his roommate, treats Tom with any decency, perceiving that being different is not the same as being unmasculine. This growing tension is observed by Laura Reynolds, wife of the coach. The Reynolds are also Tom's and Al's house master and mistress. She tries to build a connection with the young man, often inviting him alone to tea, and eventually falls in love with him, in part because of his many similarities to her first husband John, who was killed in World War II. The situation escalates when Tom is goaded into visiting the local prostitute to dispel suspicions about his sexuality, but things go badly. His failure to lose his virginity causes him to attempt suicide in the woman's kitchen. His father arrives from the city to meet with the dean about Tom's impending expulsion, having been alerted to Tom's raffish intentions by a classmate. Assuming his son's success, he gets one of the film's biggest send-ups as he boasts of his son's sexual triumph and time-honored leap into manhood until the Reynolds inform him otherwise. Laura goes in search of Tom and finds him where he often goes to ruminate, near the golf course's sixth tee. She tries to comfort him, counseling that he'll have a wife and family some day, but he's inconsolable. She starts to leave, then returns, takes his hand, and utters the film's famous line, ""Years from now when you talk about this, and you will, be kind."" The film opens and closes ten years into the future, when the adult Tom, who is now a successful writer and married, returns to his prep school. The final scene, new to the Hollywood version, shows Tom visiting his old coach and house master to ask after Laura. Bill tells him that, last he's heard, she's out west somewhere but he has a note from her to him, which she enclosed in her last letter to her ex-husband. Tom opens it outside and learns she wrote it after reading his published novel derived from his time at the school and their relationship. After their moment of passion, she tells him, she had no choice but to leave her husband."

With the help of veteran trainer Lucien Laurin , Chenery manages to navigate the male-dominated business, ultimately fostering the first Triple Crown winner in 25 years and one of the greatest racehorses of all time. The film begins with Penny learning of her mother's death and returning to her childhood home. She reunites with Mrs. Ham, her father's secretary, and comforts her confused and elderly father. At her mother's funeral, Penny meets Arthur ""Bull"" Hancock and his son, Seth Hancock, of Claiborne Farm in Kentucky. The Hancocks offer to Penny any help she may need during her efforts to bring Meadow Stables back to profitability. Penny's brother Hollis informs her of a bad and dishonest sale that was about to be made by the trainer until their mother stopped him. Penny fires the trainer and asks Bull Hancock to help her find a new trainer. He recommends Lucien Laurin, an aging French Canadian, who initially turns down Penny's offer. Penny's father had made a deal with leading owner Ogden Phipps that if Phipps would breed his best stallion  with Chenerey's two best mares  that when the mares were close to term they would flip a coin to see who got which foal. Bold Ruler, the stallion, was fast but couldn't last over distances. Hasty Matilda was the obvious choice due to her young age, but Somethingroyal's bloodline was made up of many horses with good stamina. Penny hopes to win and choose Somethingroyal's foal due to the interesting mix of speed and stamina. Phipps picks Hasty Matilda and Penny wins Somethingroyal's foal, Secretariat. When Big Red  enters his first race at Aqueduct race track in Queens, New York, everyone has high expectations. The jockey, Paul , is very young with little experience which worries Penny but Lucien reassures her and says they will do fine. During the race, Red repeatedly is hit. First when he comes out of the gate, and repeatedly in the pack and on the rail. Red comes in 4th due to running like he was afraid of the other horses due to their hitting. Penny and Lucien fight and Lucien blames Paul for the loss. Penny realizes the only way Red could ever win is if he had an experienced jockey. Penny's flight back home is canceled on the day of the race and she misses her daughter Kate's solo in the play. Her son holds up the pay phone so Penny can hear her sing. The scene closes with Penny covering part of the phone and crying over missing important parts of her children's lives. Penny gets experienced jockey Ron Turcotte to ride Red who leads him to many victories. Secretariat is named horse of the year after a successful two-year-old year, but all the colts of Bold Ruler can't handle the distances that three-year-olds run. Penny's father suffers a stroke and dies, leaving Penny and her brother Hollis to inherit the estate. Penny needs six million dollars to pay estate taxes, but refuses to sell Secretariat. Instead she syndicates Red, selling 32 shares worth more than six million dollars, as long as he can win a three year old distance race. She tries to sell a share to Ogden Phipps, who instead offers to buy Red for eight million dollars. Penny refuses to sell him. When Phipps demands to know why, she tells him Red's value will triple when he wins the Triple Crown – a feat no horse has accomplished in twenty-five years. During this time Frank ""Pancho"" Martin, trainer of rival horse Sham, provokes a match race with Red. Red is taken to the Wood Memorial three weeks before the first of the Triple Crown races to take on Sham and attempt to earn Penny her syndication money. Ronnie notices that Red's breathing is heavy and he refuses to eat, and is reluctant to allow the bit into his mouth. Red loses the race, after which it's discovered he has an abscess which may have caused the loss. Red recovers and wins the Derby and Preakness in record time, then wins the Belmont by 31 lengths  to secure the Triple Crown."

She has lost her baby from the shock, and as a meagre compensation, is offered work as a wet-nurse in middle-class families where presumably women have other things to do than feed their children. Perhaps because of the social difference, she is in no position to resist the advances from the “gentlemen” who take advantage of her presence, and she soon finds herself caught in a system whereby if she wants to bring some cash home, and feed an ailing husband, she needs to continue to breast-feed. Naturally this can only be achieved if she delivers again, and so she does. But she has no children. One day, before important elections, alongside with a street-cleaning programme, she is asked to leave town because she’s a prostitute. She then tries to meet the “gentlemen” who formerly used to be pleased with her in more than one way, but all of them reject her, now that the word “prostitute” has been pronounced publicly. She will end up a pensioner in the brothel and the last picture is that of one young man coming to look at her, a young man whom she had lovingly suckled when he was a baby.{{cite web}}

She boards a commuter train home, with an elderly couple and their daughter being her only company in the compartment. Then a trio of three young men, drug-hazed and violent, enter the wagon, notice the young girl and brutally gang-rape her. The other passengers are too timid to intervene; only after the culprits have left the train do they call the police. Shruti is taken to a hospital, but the trauma of the rape proves too much for her to bear, and she eventually dies from a massive shock in front of her anguished parents, Shrikant and Shradha Varma. Kripa Shankar Thakur, an honest and upright inspector of the Indian police, is entrusted with the case. He begins to sympathize with the parents, especially after coming face to face with the indifference and selfishness of the authorities  and everyone who is - even indirectly - responsible for Shruti's rape and death. In addition, the culprits turn out to be the sons of wealthy and influential citizens, making it highly difficult for justice to be dealt out in the regular way. After tracking down the identities of the witnesses, Shankar sets a trap to catch the offenders in the act: Dressed provocatively, Shradha acts as bait by boarding the same train her daughter has taken. Indeed, the three culprits appear and attempt to rape her as well. In her rage over her daughter's suffering at the hands of these men, Shradha wrests a knife from one of them and viciously stabs her attacker to death; consequently, she is arrested and detained for manslaughter. More determined than ever, Inspector Shankar continues his pursuit for justice, even with the weight of corruption rising to obstruct him; he meets threats with counter-threats and attempts at bribery with the arrest of the perpetrators, and even gains popular support from influential people in the law enforcement.

As the movie returns to the present, Kuala wanders about in dirty clothes and with mangy hair. The townsfolk make fun of Kuala. She is pushed into a watering hole and almost drowns. Bertong Ketong , a leper lonely for female companionship, attracts Kuala with a rattle and takes her to his shack in the cemetery. Junior  makes friends with them, defying the prohibitions of his father, Cesar Blanco, a lawyer and a failed politician. Junior asks Berto's advice concerning his problems with an eccentric teacher, Mr. Del Mundo , who has a crush on him. Junior has problems too with his girlfriend Evangeline , who flirts with her escort during a Santacruzan. The jealous Junior leaves the procession and seeks the company of Milagros , who seduces him. The Asociacion de las Damas Cristianas is scandalized to discover Kuala is pregnant. She is forced to live under the custody of the pious Lola Jacoba . When Berto makes a clandestine visit to Kuala, she tells him of his unhappiness. Berto tells this to Junior, who resolves to help the pregnant Kuala make an escape from Lola Jacoba's house and lead her back to Berto's shack. However, Burto knows she will be taken away and returns her to Lola Jacoba, and promises to retrieve her after she has given birth. Some nights later, Kuala experiences labor pains. She finds her way to Berto's shack, at which point Berto rushes out to fetch a doctor. When the doctor refuses to help him, Berto takes him hostage but repeats he will not kill him. As Berto flees with the doctor, the doctor's wife shouts for help, awakening the townspeople who rush to follow the fleeing pair. Before Berto and the doctor reach the shack in the cemetery, however, the doctor escapes and a chase ensues. A group of policemen come to the doctor's rescue and shoot Berto. Junior sees this and is shocked; he holds Berto's dead body and cries in front of the whole town. Junior then enters the shack where Kuala has successfully given birth to a baby boy, but the labor has made her weak. Her thinking becomes lucid, and in her sanity she recognizes Junior and realizes that Berto has been killed. She also recognizes Cesar among the crowd, she asks him why he killed their child, revealing his secret. Kuala then gives her baby to Junior, and dies. As Junior leaves the shack, he stared hard at the townspeople, his parents, his former girlfriend and to everyone who were unkind to him, to Berto and to Kuala. He walks near Berto's body and stops by, as the people look on in silence. Junior leaves the cemetery with Berto and Kuala's baby.

Still, he is so valuable a player that the Cubs management hides the letters from his hometown sweetheart Nellie , so that Elmer won't bolt the team and head for home. When Nellie comes to visit Elmer, she finds him in an innocent but compromising situation with a glamorous actress Claire Dodd. She turns her back on him, and disconsolate Elmer tries to forget his troubles at a crooked gambling house. Elmer incurs an enormous gambling debt, which the casino's owner is willing to forget if Elmer will only throw the deciding World Series game . Elmer brawls with the gambler and lands in jail, where he learns of a particularly cruel practical joke that had previously been played on him. Out of spite, he refuses to play in the Big Game, and thanks to a jailhouse visit by the gamblers, it looks as though Elmer has taken a bribe, but when he shows up to play , Elmer proves that he's been true-blue all along. Based on the Broadway play by Ring Lardner and George M. Cohan, Elmer the Great betrays its stage origins in its static early scenes, but builds confidently to a terrific climax during a rain-soaked ball game.

He's there for the funeral of his good friend J.J., a local Native American carpenter. Ryder spends his time in town reading the Bible while drinking straight tequila sans salt and lime. Ryder talks to J.J.'s sister Nancy . Nancy says that it's believed that J.J. drowned in a river, but J.J.'s teenage son Junior  doesn't believe that. Local businessman John Reno  introduces himself to Ryder, and Ryder gets a room at a local hotel. Reno tells Murphy , one of his employees, to keep an eye on Ryder. At the hotel, Sheriff Acoma , who seems to be alcoholic, tells Ryder that now that J.J.'s funeral is over, Ryder shouldn't still be in town. Ryder enters the local situation by beating up a group of Reno's thugs who are beating a local drug user named Billy  for not paying back money he owes to them. At Nancy's house, White Deer , the father of Nancy and J.J., talks to Nancy's 15-year-old daughter Kiowa , who is Junior's older sister. Kiowa believes that J.J., who was a member of the tribal council, was killed because he knew something about Reno. It looks like Reno is a tyrant who has the town under his stranglehold. Kiowa thinks that some of the tribal council members might be on Reno's side. White Deer, Nancy, Kiowa, and Junior go to a tribal council meeting, where two proposals will be decided on, and Reno is there. Chief Dan  announces that Assistant Chief Lance  has suggested that the council still discuss the Gaming 3 proposal—a proposal for the building of a state-of-the-art casino on tribal property by Assistant Chief Lance's construction group. That proposal would bring many new jobs and much revenue for the tribe's people, but the council is concerned with the many negative aspects of the proposal. For now, there's a very innovative on-line gaming alternative that was proposed by J.J. and his family. It's a proposal that offers more highly-skilled jobs and training for the tribe's people, and takes advantage of gaming profits without the negative aspects. That is the proposal that Dan will recommended to the council. Assistant Chief Lance gets angry and leaves. Reno tells Lance that he'll take care of things. Later, while Ryder is out walking, he's met by Billy. Billy tells Ryder that Reno runs the town, and that everyone's afraid of him. And then Billy tells Ryder that Reno had J.J. murdered. Nancy talks to Sheriff Acoma in his office, saying that something has to be done about Reno. Sheriff Acoma says that the last time he tried to investigate Reno, a judge quickly called the investigation off. A frustrated Nancy leaves Sheriff Acoma's office. Kiowa and Junior go to the Save More Grocery Store, and Kiowa goes inside and asks the clerk a question. The clerk said that J.J. came in and got a case of beer on the day of his death. But Kiowa knows that J.J. was not a drinker, and Reno is a drinker. Kiowa goes outside and sees some of Reno's thugs roughing Junior up. They tell Kiowa to tell Nancy to drop J.J.'s proposal that the tribal council is considering. They start roughing up Kiowa, and then Ryder shows up and beats them up. Ryder takes Kiowa and Junior to their home, and they invite him in for dinner. He accepts. During dinner, Junior says that as soon as he turns 18, he's going to leave the town and not end up like J.J. did. Outside, Kiowa talks to Ryder, and admits that she never knew her father, and that J.J. took care of her like he was the father she never had. That's why she misses him so much. That night, Billy witnesses a drug deal going down between Reno and some Mexican men down by the river that J.J. was found in. Reno has his men kill the Mexican men, and then Reno tells Murphy to find Billy and kill him. Later, Assistant Chief Lance tells Reno that there can be no more killing. Assistant Chief Lance says that Reno's ways of doing things attract too much attention. Assistant Chief Lance had told Reno that if he got J.J. out of the way, then Assistant Chief Lance would get approval to build the casino. Reno plans to kill Nancy and her family in order to make sure no one is in the way. On the next day, Ryder is teaching some of the Bible to some kids that White Deer regularly teaches, and Junior yells for Nancy to come down to the old camp ground near their home. Junior has found Billy, who was shot in the arm. They take Billy to the house, and some of Reno's men arrive. Ryder beats them up, and shoots up their vehicles. And then he makes them leave. Ryder has White Deer take Kiowa and Junior to a safe place, and White Deer says that he knows of a place that Reno doesn't know the location of. Ryder and Nancy find Sheriff Acoma, and tell him that Reno's men shot Billy because Billy witnessed the drug deal. Reno shows up and talks about filing assault charges against Ryder for beating his men up. Ryder accompanies Reno to a bar owned by Reno. Reno offers to let Ryder work for him, but Ryder refuses. One of Reno's men tries to beat Ryder up, but Ryder beats the man up, and shoots up Reno's bar. Ryder walks outside, and Reno follows him with a gun. Sheriff Acoma arrives and tells Reno to put the gun down. Reno and his men go back inside. That night, Reno calls a gang of bikers into town, and the gang is led by a man named Jarfe . They are the bikers that Reno is trying to get the casino built for, and Jarfe had also shot Ryder once before. Jarfe and his gang are also the biker gang that killed Nancy's husband, the father of Kiowa and Junior. By now, Billy is out in the town, and Jarfe finds him and fatally shoots him. Jarfe heads into the hotel that Ryder is staying in, and Jarfe and his men attack the hotel's owner. After that, Jarfe and his men kill a pair of arriving deputies.

That evening, at Gail's 18th birthday party, Joan flirts with Chuck, and when her angry sister confronts her, Joan reveals the truth about her background. The following morning, Lois tells Gail her biological father was killed in an accident before she was born, but her mother, Gert Lynch, is alive. Gail persuades Lois to have their lawyer arrange a meeting with her birth mother, but Lois decides to visit Gert in her Long Beach home first.

Seeking an escape, Bob flies to Kuwait to report on the Iraq War and to prove to his wife and himself that he is a man. However, he stumbles onto the story of a lifetime when he meets a retired Special Forces operator, Lyn Cassady , who reveals that he was part of an American army unit training psychic spies  to develop a range of parapsychological skills including invisibility, remote viewing, and phasing. The back story is told mainly through flashbacks. In 1972, U.S. Army officer Bill Django , after accidentally falling out of a UH-1 Iroquois ""Huey"" helicopter in the Binh Duong province of Vietnam, found his men to be unable or unwilling to fire on a female Viet Cong soldier before she shot him in the chest. He then underwent a fact-finding mission prompted by a vision where the Viet Cong soldier says, ""their gentleness is their strength."" The bulk of Django's mission immersed him into the New Age movement so that, when he returned to Fort Bragg in 1980, he had long braided hair and a tattoo of a third eye surmounted on a pyramid on his chest. Facilitated by the open-minded General Hopgood ([[Stephen Lang , Django led the training of a New Earth Army, with Lyn Cassady and Larry Hooper  as his top students. The two quickly developed a lifelong rivalry because of their opposing views of how to implement the New Earth Army philosophy; Lyn wanted to emphasize the positive side of the teachings, whereas Larry was more interested in the ""dark side"". Prompted by a doodle in Bob's notebook , Lyn takes him into Iraq. They are kidnapped by criminals who want to sell them to the insurgents, but escape with fellow hostage Mahmud Daash  and are rescued by a private security detail led by Todd Nixon . When the detail is caught in a firefight, the three of them flee. Bob and Lyn then continue on Lyn's vague mission involving a vision he had of Bill Django. After taking the wrong fork in the road, their car hits an IED in the road. The other fork in the road, to the left, reads al-Qaim, Lyn's destination, but neither of them could read the Arabic on the roadsigns. Bob and Lyn wander in the desert where Lyn reveals that he had stopped a goat's heart to test the limit of his mental abilities, an action he feels has cursed him. As part of this curse, it is revealed that Hooper conducted an unauthorized LSD experiment in which a soldier killed himself, forcing Django out of the Army. Eventually, Bob and Lyn are rescued and rehabilitated at a camp run by PSIC, a private research firm engaged in psychological and psychic experiments on a herd of goats and some captured locals. To Lyn's dismay, Larry Hooper runs the firm and employs Django, now a depressed alcoholic. Bob spends time with Django and learns the ways of the New Earth Army. They spike the water and food of the base with LSD and free both the goats and captured locals. Following this, Lyn and Django fly off in a helicopter, never to be heard from again, disappearing into the sky ""like all shamans"". Bob returns to work as a reporter and writes an article about his entire experience with Lyn. However, he is frustrated in that the only portion of the story to be aired on the news is how the captives were forced to listen to 24 hours of the Barney & Friends theme song. This dilutes his story to the level of a joke, and Bob vows to continue trying to get the bigger story out. In the film's final scene, Bob exercises his own psychic abilities and, following intense concentration, runs through a solid wall in his office."

The two quickly developed a lifelong rivalry because of their opposing views of how to implement the New Earth Army philosophy; Lyn wanted to emphasize the positive side of the teachings, whereas Larry was more interested in the ""dark side"". Prompted by a doodle in Bob's notebook , Lyn takes him into Iraq. They are kidnapped by criminals who want to sell them to the insurgents, but escape with fellow hostage Mahmud Daash  and are rescued by a private security detail led by Todd Nixon . When the detail is caught in a firefight, the three of them flee. Bob and Lyn then continue on Lyn's vague mission involving a vision he had of Bill Django. After taking the wrong fork in the road, their car hits an IED in the road. The other fork in the road, to the left, reads al-Qaim, Lyn's destination, but neither of them could read the Arabic on the roadsigns. Bob and Lyn wander in the desert where Lyn reveals that he had stopped a goat's heart to test the limit of his mental abilities, an action he feels has cursed him. As part of this curse, it is revealed that Hooper conducted an unauthorized LSD experiment in which a soldier killed himself, forcing Django out of the Army. Eventually, Bob and Lyn are rescued and rehabilitated at a camp run by PSIC, a private research firm engaged in psychological and psychic experiments on a herd of goats and some captured locals. To Lyn's dismay, Larry Hooper runs the firm and employs Django, now a depressed alcoholic. Bob spends time with Django and learns the ways of the New Earth Army. They spike the water and food of the base with LSD and free both the goats and captured locals. Following this, Lyn and Django fly off in a helicopter, never to be heard from again, disappearing into the sky ""like all shamans"". Bob returns to work as a reporter and writes an article about his entire experience with Lyn. However, he is frustrated in that the only portion of the story to be aired on the news is how the captives were forced to listen to 24 hours of the Barney & Friends theme song. This dilutes his story to the level of a joke, and Bob vows to continue trying to get the bigger story out. In the film's final scene, Bob exercises his own psychic abilities and, following intense concentration, runs through a solid wall in his office."

She idolizes David Bowie and cuts her hair  and dons make-up so she will resemble Bowie's Aladdin Sane character. At her high school talent show, she lip syncs to ""Lady Grinning Soul"" and, receives many rude comments from the audience, while Marie tries her best to applaud her. Cherie ends up flipping off the audience when they begin throwing things, in addition to the comments. Against all odds, she ends up winning. Joan Jett  is a bisexual teenager who also dreams of rock and roll stardom. Joan goes into a rough-type store at the beginning of the film, and looks at all of the boys' outfits. The sales clerk rudely says that Joan is in the wrong section, whereupon Joan dumps out all of her money onto the counter, and smartly says that she wants what the other customer  is wearing. She hangs out with her best friend, and, during drug experimentation and staying out late, teaches herself to play guitar and to sing. She and her best friend discuss sexuality as well, and things come to a minor head when she kisses Joan. Joan begins guitar lessons from a man who is supposedly great, but he teaches her the basics, and does not listen to her when she politely asks about his amps. He ignores her request at being called ""Joan Jett"", and refers to her as ""Joan Larkin"". He tries to teach her ""On Top of Old Smokey"", and Joan adds a very vulgar lyric to it, to which he becomes offended, telling her that vulgarity isn't funny. She tries again to tell him what she wants, to play like the song ""Johnny B. Goode"", but he still doesn't listen, claiming that girls don't play electric guitar. Frustrated, Joan hooks up her guitar to an amp without permission, and, despite her teachers' protest, begins to play her guitar electrically. After him screaming at her to stop, Joan leaves in a huff. At a club one night, Joan is getting friendly with a young man when she spots Kim Fowley, a famous record producer . Her male friend says something sexual to her, and Joan turns him down, but tells him to wait for her when she goes to introduce herself to Kim. She approaches him, and she introduces herself as Joan Jett, and Kim tells her that that's a cool name. He then asks her if she's in a band and, if so, does she have a demo. Joan tells him no, and says, ""no guys"", and talks about starting an all-girl rock band. Kim soon shows his interest by introducing Joan to Sandy West , who is a drummer. Joan and Sandy become friends and start jamming together, and Kim calls to check up on them. He soon says that they will be bigger than The Beatles, and soon sits in on their rehearsals. He then suggests that they recruit a hot blonde in the vein of Brigitte Bardot. Kim and Joan comb Los Angeles' clubs to look for hot blondes and soon discover Cherie. Kim sees her first, while Joan meets Marie across the room and compliments her on her pants. Kim calls Joan over and introduces the two of them. Kim asks Cherie if she can sing or play an instrument, and Joan gives Cherie a reassuring nod, before Cherie claims that she can sing, and tells them of her talent show victory. Kim says that they love her look, and then tells her to learn a Suzi Quatro song for an audition at a trailer park in the San Fernando Valley. Kim orders Joan to give Cherie the information and leaves, and Joan does, following an inviting ""Come find me"", before leaving with Kim. Cherie learns Suzi Quatro's ""Fever"" and goes to audition, but the band is very disappointed at her choice of song, in particular Lita Ford, who says that ""Fever"" is a song that is too slow. Kim orders Cherie out of the trailer while he and Joan write ""Cherry Bomb"", on the spot for her to perform at her audition. Cherie sings it and, after quickly improving, is part of the band, named The Runaways, joined by Lita Ford  on lead guitar and Robin Robins  on bass. .[2] The band rehearses pretty often and are soon about to go onto their U.S. tour. On the day that they are scheduled to leave, Cherie remarks to Marie that she wants to borrow a fancy outfit of hers. Marie refuses, despite the fact that it is Cherie's favorite as well, and tells her that she wants to save it for special occasions. Cherie tells her to forget it, and continues packing, but Marie has a change of heart and allows Cherie to take it. When Cherie is saying her goodbyes, her aunt remarks that her father didn't come home the night before. . Cherie tells her aunt not to worry, and that her father can take care of himself. She leaves the house when the band pulls up to collect her, and meets her roadie, Scott, who takes her suitcase from Marie to put it into the car. Then, Cherie spots her father's car parked outside the house, and goes to investigate. Upon further examination, she sees him, drunk and passed out, in the drivers' seat. She and Marie go to him, but Lita irritably beeps the horn from a few feet away, telling Cherie to hurry up. In a heartbreaking moment, Cherie must choose between the band and her family. Ultimately, Marie makes the choice when she tells her twin to go, that she will take care of their father. After arriving at the hotel, the band complains about their room. The room only has two double beds, and they're limited to only one room to cut costs. Scott, their roadie, tells them that they can share his room if they want to. The gang then decides to go swimming, and Cherie breaks away from Joan and the rest of the band to call home. She gets ahold of Marie, who says that, despite the fact that Cherie left when things looked bad, that their father looks better. Cherie thanks her, and describes the hotel with false information: They each have their own room, there's a wet bar, and the pool is awesome. Marie remarks that she wishes that she was there, and Cherie agrees with her. From the pool, Sandy screams at Cherie to get in, and Cherie lies to Marie and says that she needs to go practice. On the night of the show, Cherie and Scott end up making out in the only bathroom available to the band. Joan and Sandy are horsing around backstage, waiting for their set when Joan realizes that she has to go to the bathroom. After realizing that she cannot go into the bathroom, because Cherie and Scott are in there, she and Sandy break in to the dressing room of the other band playing that night. Sandy remarks that they got better food than they did, and that their dressing room is bigger and better that theirs. To spite them, Joan ends up peeing on one of the guitars, and when Sandy claims that she can't do that, Joan says that she doesn't care what the band will think. When Joan sings ""I Love Playing With Fire"" at a later concert, Joan and Cherie are full of drugs. They are playing at a roller rink, and Cherie is watching from the sidelines as a bunch of disco lights flash around them. After the song, Joan joins Cherie, along with the rest of the band and Scott, on the roller rink floor. Joan is smoking, and she and Cherie still have drugs in their system. Because Joan has had an attraction to Cherie since they first met, she leans down and kisses her. Cherie quickly responds, and fuzzy images are shown of Joan picking Cherie up and taking her back to their room. In the dim light, Joan and Cherie are seen having drug-induced sex, and by the next morning, it is unclear if they remember anything. The next scene shows Joan wearing her underwear and a t-shirt, and hands up the phone and goes to wake Cherie, who is wrapped up in the bed sheet. Joan says that they did it, and it looks like Joan knows what happened between them last night and will tell Cherie about it, but then she says that they are signed to Mercury Records and tells her that they are going to Hollywood, California in an hour, and kisses Cherie again in her joy. The Runaways ultimately release an album. They rehearse even more because of the release of the album, but due to that, Cherie's voice is getting tired, thus targeting Kim's temper. He gets angry with her, but calls her later to apologize, and tells her that if she listens to him, she will be a success. Then he tells her that a photographer from Japan is scheduled to come by her house to get some pictures of her. When Cherie asks him if the band is coming over, Kim says that the photographer wants to do solo shots and solo interviews, and that Cherie will be the first. In the next scene, Cherie, scantily clad in black, poses in various ways on her back lawn for the photographer, much to the chagrin of her grandmother. Her grandmother ends up coming out of the house and hitting the man with her cane. Shortly before a rehearsal one day, Cherie is eating a quick snack in her kitchen when Marie comes in, wearing a kimono and bowing to her. She says ""thank you very much"" in Japanese, as Cherie promised to take Marie the next time she went on tour with the band. In a heart-wrenching moment, Cherie looks away, and Marie realizes that she won't be going to Japan with Cherie. Cherie says that nobody brings their families on tour, and Marie insists that she could help them while on tour. Cherie brushes her off and goes to rehearse. During the flight to Japan, Scott whispers to Cherie and Joan that if they have any drugs, they should get rid of them, because Japan is more strict than America. Joan and Cherie stumble to the airplanes' bathroom and end up taking more drugs before they realize that they can't take anymore. They flush the rest, and the scene dissolves to them coming out of a limo to a massive crowd, dressed in kimonos, who is shouting for Cherie. Kim later calls Joan at the hotel, and Joan lies and says she's learned how to eat with chopsticks. She sees Cherie in the next room, clad in her corset, and gets off the phone with Kim to get a better look at her. Cherie tells her that she is going to wear it during a concert. Joan tells her that Cherie will get the band in trouble if she does, whereupon Cherie asks Joan if she looks sexy, in her opinion, and the scene ends there. Cherie gets permission to sing ""Cherry Bomb"" in her new corset. She is high during most of the Japan concerts, and this one is no exception. Before going onstage, she stomps on some drugs and takes them before going onstage. While high, she performs very well, and nobody suspects what she's up to. After their performance, Lita throws the magazines at Cherie that have pictures of her. As Lita, Cherie, and Joan argue, overenthusiastic fans break through the window and chase the girls out of the building. Cherie's drug problems soon get worse. Marie calls her at her fancy hotel and demands that she come home, as their father's drinking has gotten worse. Cherie, who was seducing Scott, replies that she doesn't have a home, and hangs up on her. When she is about to do an interview, Scott is escorting her downstairs to the press, and she's looking very ill. Scott says that everyone's anger doesn't matter, because she is all the people wants. She ends up collapsing in an elevator and is sent to the hospital. Joan is there when she wakes up, and it is clear the band is on thin ice. Upon arriving back in the United States, Cherie begins to abuse her alcoholic father's painkiller medication. Cherie, while at the studio recording their next album, reads a magazine article that involves the band. Sandy approaches her and asks to know what she's reading. She reads over her shoulder that Kim has said to the magazine that Cherie's attitude was like, ""...a dog urinating in your face..."" and that she should commit suicide like Marilyn Monroe. Lita smugly says that Kim's interpretation is correct, and Joan tells her to shut up, and tries to persuade Cherie to sing. Cherie has a mental breakdown and refuses to sing. Lita continues to insult her, and Joan defends her, possibly out of her attraction for her. Kim comes into the room and demands that Cherie sing. She confronts him on the article, and he tells her that it is good publicity for the band and refuses to listen to her. Cherie yells at Kim that she's not going to be ""his little lapdog"" anymore. She leaves the room, thus quitting the band. Joan goes after her, and asks Cherie why she did this. Cherie says that she can't do it anymore, and that her family needs her. Joan says that this is her life as Cherie walks out of the studio. Joan is outraged, and returns into the room where Cherie quit. Kim says that the girls would be, ""...lucky if they got a gig singing in the shower..."" Joan ends up throwing things at the sound booth window, and gets up on the table in front of it to curse Kim out, who responds by screaming, ""Anarchy! Mayhem!"", and The Runaways are finished. Cherie returns home and does not do better with her drugs. She goes to a supermarket while high and drunk and tries to buy a bottle of alcohol. The cashier tells her that she cannot sell it to her, and orders the manager to the register. He, too, says that she cannot buy it, and orders Cherie out of the store. Cherie ends up collapsing again in a phone booth in the supermarket parking lot, after calling Marie at work to come and pick her up. At the hospital, her sister Marie visits her and tells her to straighten up herself. After hooking up with both young men and women, Joan tries to teach her good friend how to play the guitar. She has lots of parties with drugs and alcohol, and her musical carrier is going nowhere. After her friend mentions Cherie's success with a movie part, Joan abruptly orders all of the young men and women, who are passed out in her living room, out of her house.She tells her friend to stay, and she goes out to think. Joan soon starts her own band, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts. A few years later, Cherie, now clean and sober, is working in a bakery and hears Joan's cover of ""I Love Rock 'n' Roll"" on the radio. Her boss tells her to get back to work, but calls the station, anyway. Joan is visiting for interviews to up publicity for her band. After an awkward conversation between Joan, Cherie, and radio host Rodney Bingenheimer , Cherie says her goodbyes and continues working, as the camera cuts momentarily back to Joan, smiling to herself, possibly remembering all of the crazy times she and Cherie spent together. Then, the camera cuts back to Cherie, who is smiling as Joan's next song, ""Crimson and Clover"", comes on the radio,"

Between trying to keep the family farm up and running her job in the village shop, aided by the elderly and partly blind Mrs. Docherty, she also has three dutiful, yet boisterous children to look after, Norman, Megsie and Vincent. All of this she has to do while her husband is away at war. So when her children's two haughty and spoiled cousins, Cyril and Celia Gray are sent to live on their farm and another war is being fought between the two sets of children, she is in need of a little magic. She hears a mysterious voice telling her that she needs Nanny McPhee and, to her astonishment, Nanny McPhee appears on her doorstep one stormy night. Nanny McPhee arrives to take matters into her own hands. At first, the children do not listen and carry on fighting, but she calmly bangs her stick, causing them to start hurting themselves, and Vincent to break things with his cricket bat. Eventually, they apologise, and the two groups learn to tolerate each other. Nanny McPhee then teaches them another lesson, to share, and punishes them, by forcing the older boys to share their bed with a goat, the girls with the family cow, and Vincent with a baby elephant, making them realise sharing with one another wasn't so bad and start acting kinder to one another. For instance, Megsie gives Celia some of her best clothing when the ones she brought are ruined, which had made her resort to wearing their mother's wedding dress. Meanwhile, Isabel's brother-in-law Phil has gambled away the farm and is being chased down by two hit women. He desperately attempts to make Isabel sell her half of the farm, using an array of schemes. These include digging a hole so that the family piglets can escape, but by working together, the children manage to round them up in time. To celebrate catching the piglets, Mrs. Green takes all the children on a picnic, during which Mr. Docherty, warns them all about bombs and how he imagines a pilot might accidentally release his bomb in the remote area in which the family lives. At the end of the picnic Uncle Phil delivers a telegram saying that Rory Green has been ""killed in action"" in the war. Isabel believes the telegram, along with everybody else. But Norman does not, and says that he has a feeling ""in his bones"" that his father is not dead. He tells this to Cyril, who at first says it is just because he is upset, but then agrees to help Norman determine the truth. They realise that Cyril's father, Lord Gray, a high-ranking figure in the War Office can find out for himself what has happened to Rory. So they manage to get Nanny McPhee to take them to London on her motorcycle. Upon arrival in London, Nanny McPhee uses her status in the army to get the boys access to the War Office, where they meet Lord Grey. At first he scoffs at Norman when he tells him about his disbelief of his father's death, but after Cyril angrily informs his father that he knows that his parents are getting a divorce, he gives in and goes to check on Rory's status. While he is gone, Cyril tells Norman that he and Celia have been sent away because their parents will be splitting up, and not because of the bombs, and he is unsure where he and Celia will have to live. Norman tells Cyril that he and Celia are welcome to live on the farm with the Greens, to his delight. Lord Grey returns and informs them that Rory is not listed as killed in action, as the telegram had stated, but rather missing in action, and that there is no record of a telegram ever having been sent to Isabel. The boys then leave and Norman works out that the telegram brought to his mother by Uncle Phil was in fact a fraud to get Isabel to sell the farm. While the boys are at the War Office, Megsie, Celia and Vincent are trying to stop Isabel from signing the papers and selling the farm. When their own efforts fail, Megsie calls to Nanny McPhee for help, who hears her plea and summons a baby Elephant to stall for time. Just as Isabel is about to sign the papers, an enemy plane flies overhead. The pilot sneezes twice, and on the third sneeze, a huge bomb is dropped, but does not explode and is sticking out of the barley field. When Nanny McPhee returns with Norman and Cyril, thanks to the Nanny's magic, the children go out to watch Mr. Docherty dismantle the bomb, but he falls from the ladder and faints, and Megsie takes over. She succeeds with the help of the other children and Nanny McPhee's putty eating bird, Mr. Edelweiss. Nanny McPhee then helps to harvest the barley and saves Phil from the hit women, with a little magic, and she and Mrs. Docherty watch the family celebrate. During their conversation, Mrs. Docherty says to Mr. Docherty that Nanny McPhee hates goodbyes and that she remembers from when she was young. She then takes out a rattle, revealing that she is baby Aggie from the first film. As Nanny McPhee walks away from the now happy family, true to her statement ""When you need me, but do not want me, I must stay. When you want me, but no longer need me, then I have to go"", the children and Isabel chase after her, determined to prove they still need her. However, they discover that they in fact do not, as they round a bend to see that their father is descending from the hill, passing Nanny McPhee along the way. Rory Green , in army uniform and with an injured arm, runs to the arms of his children and wife and rejoices in the discovery that after leaving three children to go to war, he has returned to find five. As Nanny McPhee watches the reunion, now a beautiful woman, she forgives Mr. Edelweiss and allows him to perch on her shoulder as they leave into the distance.  In addition to emphasising discipline, manners and accepting the consequences of one's actions, Nanny McPhee has five very important base lessons to teach – each of which correspond to her various unattractive physical attributes: grey hair, two large moles, a unibrow, and a snaggle-tooth protruding over her bottom lip, all of which give her the appearance of a stereotypical witch. Nanny is as ugly as the children are naughty, so whenever a lesson is learned, one of her disfigurements vanishes. When all five lessons are learned, Nanny McPhee transforms from ugly to beautiful woman. *Lesson #1: To stop fighting – Upper wart disappears *Lesson #2: To share – Lower wart disappears *Lesson #3: To work together – Unibrow disappears *Lesson #4: To be brave – Hair changes from grey to brown *Lesson #5: To have faith – Snaggle tooth disappears and is now a beautiful woman.  *Courage - later awarded to Cyril *Kindness - later awarded to Celia *Resolve - later awarded to Megsie *Imagination - later awarded to Norman *Enthusiasm - later awarded to Vincent *Basket - work *Leaps of Faith - later awarded to Isabel"

Between trying to keep the family farm up and running her job in the village shop, aided by the elderly and partly blind Mrs. Docherty, she also has three dutiful, yet boisterous children to look after, Norman, Megsie and Vincent. All of this she has to do while her husband is away at war. So when her children's two haughty and spoiled cousins, Cyril and Celia Gray are sent to live on their farm and another war is being fought between the two sets of children, she is in need of a little magic. She hears a mysterious voice telling her that she needs Nanny McPhee and, to her astonishment, Nanny McPhee appears on her doorstep one stormy night. Nanny McPhee arrives to take matters into her own hands. At first, the children do not listen and carry on fighting, but she calmly bangs her stick, causing them to start hurting themselves, and Vincent to break things with his cricket bat. Eventually, they apologise, and the two groups learn to tolerate each other. Nanny McPhee then teaches them another lesson, to share, and punishes them, by forcing the older boys to share their bed with a goat, the girls with the family cow, and Vincent with a baby elephant, making them realise sharing with one another wasn't so bad and start acting kinder to one another. For instance, Megsie gives Celia some of her best clothing when the ones she brought are ruined, which had made her resort to wearing their mother's wedding dress. Meanwhile, Isabel's brother-in-law Phil has gambled away the farm and is being chased down by two hit women. He desperately attempts to make Isabel sell her half of the farm, using an array of schemes. These include digging a hole so that the family piglets can escape, but by working together, the children manage to round them up in time. To celebrate catching the piglets, Mrs. Green takes all the children on a picnic, during which Mr. Docherty, warns them all about bombs and how he imagines a pilot might accidentally release his bomb in the remote area in which the family lives. At the end of the picnic Uncle Phil delivers a telegram saying that Rory Green has been ""killed in action"" in the war. Isabel believes the telegram, along with everybody else. But Norman does not, and says that he has a feeling ""in his bones"" that his father is not dead. He tells this to Cyril, who at first says it is just because he is upset, but then agrees to help Norman determine the truth. They realise that Cyril's father, Lord Gray, a high-ranking figure in the War Office can find out for himself what has happened to Rory.

He is very much impressed with a TV anchor Anjali ([[Sneha , who donates her earnings for the cause of children with heart ailments. Anjali is also a good dancer. This way, Paandu becomes her ardent fan. Home Minister Bhagwan , given to womanizing, takes a look at Anjali while dancing at a function. But, Anjali rejects his advances. Bhagwan sees that Anjali is put behind bars on a false case of drug trafficking. Nobody comes to her rescue, but only one man – That is Paandu, her ardent fan. How he exposes evil deeds of the villain and proves the innocence of Anjali  forms the climax. Jagapati Babu as usual did a neat job. He displayed the much required prowess in his role as a stubborn man who does not care for any risk. Sneha's performance comes as an asset to the movie. Unlike routine heroines, she holds a meaningful footage in the movie and the story revolves round her. Her climax dance is superb. Madhu Sharma's supporting role is convincing, though has certain extra scenes. Sayaji Shinde as villain is impressive. His elevation from a juvenile criminal to a street rowdy to a politician comes as a satire. Showing him as a ruthless villain with good taste for painting and music has some variety. Venu Madhav steals the show with his comedy. Kondavalasa's role as one who is addicted to ""Yoga Asanams"" is hilarious. Dharmavarapu acted as brother-in-law to the villain and comes out with his typical witty role, equally supported by Krishna Bhagwan as lawyer. Story was straight and simple without any flashbacks, but somehow traditional. Screenplay was equally balanced in the first and second halves, with little boredom. Director Devi Prasad does not disappoint the audiences and at the same there is nothing much to speak about the direction. Songs were above average and music by Mani Sharma passed off unnoticed, but for thumping beats at the climax.Stunts by Ram Lakshman were applauded. Comedy was good and served as good support to the movie."

They feel that she may in some way be responsible for the deaths of several young men of the village, who have felt compelled, one by one, to climb the local mountain  on nights when the moon is full. Junta lives largely in solitude  in the tranquility of the mountains surrounding the village. She plays in the hills and woodlands, as a naive, free spirit. She is simple and innocent, but also seems something of a mystic. She loves to climb and clamber over the steep, difficult faces of local mountains. On full moon nights, a crack in a prominent local mountain admits the moon's light and illuminates a grotto filled with beautiful crystals. This place of indescribable beauty, glowing with magical blue light, is a sacred space for Junta. The glowing blue light, shining from afar, to the village below, is also what has attracted the village's young men, none of whom ever reached it before falling off the mountain's treacherous slope. A man from the city, a painter, traveling through the village, falls in love with Junta. He follows her to the cabin she shares with the shepherd boy, and decides to stay for a while. The man speaks only German, and Junta only Italian, so their communication is fragmentary. All is pleasant and good and very chaste, until the next full moon night, when the man sees Junta climbing up the mountain. He follows her, actually reaching the beautiful grotto, and finds Junta in a state of ecstasy among the crystals. Perceiving these thousands of crystals to be a source of immense wealth for Junta and the villagers, the man immediately runs down to inform the townsfolk and tells them of the correct route to reach the grotto. Junta does not realize that he is doing this, until the next day, when she finds some of her crystals on the path to the village, as well as some dropped tools. Rushing up to the grotto, she finds it completely barren of crystals: all have been taken by the greedy villagers. Meanwhile, the villagers and the painter are celebrating. Junta is totally devastated at this violation of the sacred grotto and of her trust in the outsider and falls to her death.

He successfully kills the creature and is briefly attacked by another who comes out of the bog. These appear to be normal people, capable of survival under the bog's depths. The man shrugs off the attacks and continues on into the night. Meanwhile an archaeology Professor David Wallace is teaching a class of students about ancient sacrifices that had taken place in Ireland centuries ago. One student with a great deal of questions confronts the mummified remains of a sacrifice, and abruptly leaves the room. Upon investigation he finds that she is a hired assistant Saiorse Reilly and she leaves with him on an archaeological evaluation of some of the local hillsides. During this time a pair of travelers Hannah Ross and her cousin Mallory break down in an automobile they had stolen and head off on foot. Along the way, Mallory sprains her ankle, and she and Hannah take refuge in a remote cabin at the central area of the bog. A woman named Val Leary and her cab driver Deano Doyle get stuck in the bog and inadvertently find their way to the cabin, shortly afterward David and Saiorse arrive, having run into a cow on a nearby road. As the six strangers learn to live together, they are greeted by the outraged owner of the house known simply as ""Hunter"" or ""The Hunter"" who invites them in for the night, promising to show them the road out the following morning. As they dine over supper, they regale stories of personal heroisms between one another; Deano states he had once rushed a woman giving birth to children to a hospital, Mallory and Hannah had saved the life of a child's father who had fallen into the bog off chance. While Val admits she had dug up one of the ""Bog Men"" sacrifices, though she lies and says she did it some time prior and had called the police  David sparks suspicion and Val and Deano leave. Hunter shortly after decides to go hunting, and provides bedding for the rest to lay on. During the night, Saiorse has a bad dream and David comforts her, the following morning, they find Deano but a large man who had earlier been resurrected from the Bog itself appears, causing Mallory to fall into a bog pool, nearly drowning, Hunter is able to free her, revealing Val's body who had apparently attempted to grab Mallory from under the bog. Now extremely ill, Mallory is taken back to the cabin, and Hunter is put under Saiorce's scrutiny saying he could have killed them. Deano is led back to the road his Taxi had gotten stuck on, but admits to Hunter he had lied about his story, accidentally killing a fare by catching her coat into the back door of his cab and dragging her to death afterward stashing her body into the swamp. After Hunter parts, Deano attempts to free his taxi and is accidentally dragged to his death as well. Back at the cabin, Hannah departs to find another way out of the bog and ends up getting captured by the giant man. David attempts to intervene and calm the bog man down, but Hunter shoots him, and in his rage the man decapitates Hannah. Upon his return, Mallory tells David that they had lied about their stories as well, that they had accidentally hit an old trench digger walking along the road and buried him near the bog. Dying shortly after, David realizes that their stories seem to have prompted this, Saiorse tells David that she too killed a man, her uncle who constantly beat and raped her, even giving her a still born child. And Hunter claims that a man he had saved in the forest ""could have"" been saved, instead he killed the man to stop his agony after he accidentally shot him in the first place.

The baggy-eyed rodent crawls out of bed, climbs the steps to the beacon, and yanks the plug out of the outlet to turn it off. Polly the parrot immediately flies into the lightkeeper’s bedroom squawking “Lights out! Lights out!” The lightkeeper wakes up shouting, “Grrrreat Scott! It’s that crrrrazy moose  again!” Consequently, a cargo carrier named Australia crashes into the rocks on the shore of the island, causing several wooden crates to spill overboard. The frustrated captain admonishes the lightkeeper to keep the beacon lit, and the lightkeeper and Polly apologize for the mishap. Hippety Hopper, a baby kangaroo intended for delivery to a city zoo, is inside one of the fallen crates, and after the ship departs, he hops off within the crate until it breaks apart against the rocks, setting him free. While all this is going on, Sylvester is downstairs sleeping. The lightkeeper abruptly wakes him up, rebuking, “While you sleep, that crrrrazy moose is loose in the hoose!” , then orders him to go upstairs to catch him and to ""Hurrrry up, now, hurrrry up, now"" . Sylvester tells Polly he can catch the mouse in a matter of seconds, and Polly starts counting the seconds. Hippety then hops into the lighthouse and follows Sylvester up the stairs. Sylvester sets a mousetrap and attaches a string. When he hears a snap, he pulls on the string and sees he has caught Hippety, whom he thinks is a giant mouse, which makes his jaw drop to the floor. Sylvester then shoots like a bullet down the stairs as Polly keeps counting , and dashes to the bathroom, thinking he must have “lighthouse eyes” or “stigmatism”. He puts in eyedrops, then, grabbing a bottle of vitamins, gulps them down and showers himself with them. Meanwhile, the mouse frees Hippety from the trap, and Hippety returns the favor by pulling the plug out of the wall.  Sylvester runs out of the bathroom, tells Polly “Keep counting, buster” , runs upstairs, puts the plug back in and pounds a few nails over it to prevent Hippety and the mouse from pulling it out again. He then prepares to knock Hippety out with a club and swings at him when he sees Hippety’s shadow approaching, but misses and sees that it is only the mouse wielding a mallet, which he uses to slam Sylvester’s foot. The mouse then zips behind the elevator door. Sylvester pounds on the door, and Hippety kicks him into the wall. Sylvester then sees Hippety and the mouse behind the door playing a back-and-forth switcheroo, making him think he must be hallucinating. Sylvester then charges back toward the elevator and Sylvester, Hippety and the mouse get into a scuffle, which ends with Hippety sending Sylvester tumbling down the stairs. By this time, Polly has counted more than 70,000 seconds , but the punch-drunk feline goes back for more, assuring Polly he will get the mouse “quicker than you can count up to Jack Robinson”. The mouse cuts the extension cord in two places with a pair of scissors, putting the lights out again, and the furious lightkeeper stalks Sylvester with a club threatening to “fix that good-fer-nothin’ pussycat”. In a panic, Sylvester attempts to reconnect the cord and gets a massive electric jolt, which turns the lights back on  and spares him a beating...for the moment. As Sylvester tapes the cord back together, the mouse rigs dynamite with the cord wrapped around it. It explodes, completely destroying the cord beyond any chance of repair. Immediately, the lightkeeper runs up the stairs and pummels Sylvester with the club. In the final scene, the lightkeeper is sleeping soundly, as are Hippety and the mouse, while Sylvester is serving as the beacon, hooked up to a battery with the light projecting through his eyes. To this, he laments, “I never thought just being a pussycat could be so complicated!”"
23440490	/m/06wb1nf	Me Shivajiraje Bhosale Boltoy	2009-04-03			"{""/m/055qm"": ""Marathi Language""}"	"{""/m/03rk0"": ""India""}"	"{""/m/07s9rl0"": ""Drama""}"	"{{Plot}} The film opens into the daily life of Dinkarrao Marutirao Bhosale, an ordinary, mild mannered bank clerk in Mumbai. The narrator points out how Bhosle represents the downfall of the once proud Maharashtrian: the meek and timid Bhosle lets himself be pushed around and humiliated by everyone. The narrator summarizes how middle class men like Bhosle live out their lives. Their middle class earnings barely support their existence and the slightest blip  courts debt. They retire to an uncertain future with dwindling incomes against the rising costs of living, and vanish into insignificance. Bhosle faces several practical troubles. His son Rahul scores just under what is required for admission to an engineering school, and his daughter Shashikala is an aspiring actor. Bhosle approaches the local politician Nandakumar ""Nandya"" Chandekar, his old friend and board member at the engineering school, but Nandya gently turns him down. Shashikala is turned away at auditions because her Maharashtrian name is not as trendy and marketable as the North Indian names. Further, Bhosle is approached by a property developer Gosalia who offers to buy out Bhosle's ancestral home; the home is located centrally in the city and Gosalia wishes to put up a lucrative mall and hotel at that location. Gosalia offers to compensate Bhosle and offer him a new flat in Badlapur outside Mumbai, and remarks that the new location is rife with Maharashtrians. Bhosle is unwilling to move from his location and will consider the offer only if he is able to get new accommodations at the same location. Bhosle's wife Sumitra is enticed by the offer, but Bhosle remains clear about his terms, leading to significant tensions at home. The troubles are worsened when Gosalia applies his connections at the city water works and stops water supply to the Bhosale manor. Bhosale is threatened and confused by these troubles. He attributes them to his Maharashtrian heritage. Late one evening he arrives home drunk and loudly laments his shame and anguish at being born a Maharashtrian. This desperate cry rouses the spirit of Shivaji Maharaj, historical founder of the Maratha Empire. Shivaji Maharaj appears before Bhosle, upset and angry that his own descendant is cursing his name. Bhosle breaks down into tears and pours out his grievances that Maharashtra is overrun by outsiders who now control the industries, offices, trades and markets. Shivaji Maharaj soundly chides him for complaining instead of applying his mind and challenging the outsiders. After a long talk, Shivaji Maharaj convinces Bhosle that it is up to him to shake off his fears and hesitation, and take action to resolve his troubles. Bhosle is heartened by this encounter, and visits the water works manager. Upon discovering that the fellow is on Gosalia's payroll, Bhosle roundly condemns his conduct. He quotes various Maharashtrian proverbs and asks how Maharashtrians can remain proud when it is the very same Maharashtrians who cave to cheap bribes. The manager is ashamed, and restores water. When Gosalia returns with additional bribes, the manager turns him away. Bhosle visits Gidwani  and his boss . He discovers that the producer is, in fact, a Maharashtrian, and he takes him to task until the producer admits his folly and Shashikala gets a part in a Marathi film. Using this money, Bhosle secures funds to obtain the motorbike. His boss tries to question him, but Bhosle is able to answer him with conviction and expose his boss's own corruption. Finally, Bhosle applies a novel strategy to outwit Gosalia. He approaches Mr. Deshmukh, another property developer on his own. The developer studies the matter and approves Bhosle's proposal. Bhosle is able to convince his neighbors to rescind their previous arrangements with Gosalia and accept Bhosle's own proposal. Bhosle also plans to construct a restaurant on some part of the land. For this purpose, he also approaches a big hotel chain owner and offers him a partnership for his new plan. The businessman agrees. Matters take a turn for the worse. Gosalia is visibly angered. He enlists a thug, Usman, to intimidate and threaten Bhosle. Accordingly, Usman visits Bhosle at home and openly threatens his life unless he agrees to Gosalia's proposal. Bhosle refuses. In retaliation, Usman applies his methods upon the young Rahul. Usman chases Rahul's motorbike to scare him. It goes a bit too far and Rahul is flung from his bike, as Shivaji Maharaj intervenes and pushes Rahul out of the way from an oncoming truck. Rahul sustains deep injuries and is taken to the hospital. Once confident, Bhosle is now completely shaken by this physical attack upon his family. Shivaji Maharaj visits him yet again. Bhosle expresses his weaknesses; he simply admits that his enemies are too strong. Shivaji Maharaj uplifts his spirits by arranging a rousing rendition of his own moment of truth during the Afzal Khan incident in the form of a powada. Bhosle recovers his wits, and decides to strike his enemy straight in the heart. He visits Usman at home and claims to have abducted and maimed Usman's son. Usman breaks down. Bhosle produces Usman's son, unharmed, and proudly speaks to his Marathi lineage. Usman is touched and immediately agrees to leave Bhosle alone forever. Finally, Bhosle approaches his old friend Nandya again. He chides him for turning away a bright student. Nandya reveals his true colors. He says that the days of politics for helping people have gone. Today's politics is all about money and politicians are about securing and wielding power to obtain more of it. He turns Bhosle out. However, Bhosle had secretly recorded Nandya's outburst. He supplies this expose to the press, and Nandya is fired by the party leaders. Nandya conspires with Gosalia and kidnaps Bhosle and his family. Bhosle is reminded of Shivaji Maharaj's daring escape from Aurangzeb's court in Delhi. He employs a similar technique to escape. He goes after Gosalia. Bhosle, along with Usman, two of his tenants, and armed with a sword, fights off Gosalia's thugs and attacks Gosalia, who is nearly killed. Bhosle refuses to kill him, but instead offers him a chance to reform himself. Having thus resolved his problems and created a new awareness for proud Maharashtrians in society, Bhosle is commended in media. However, at this time, Bhonsle approaches the Chief Minister for a seat in upcoming election in presence of people from news media. Bhonsle is strongly condemned by people for this and people gather outside his house in protest. Following this, Bhonsle gives a speech to the angry crowd, wherein he makes them realize that by not participating in democratic processes, they are themselves responsible for state of the country, and that politics is a place for corrupt people because good people do not enter politics. He then informs that he lied about entering politics so that he gets a chance to explain all this to general public. The film ends with Bhosle gladly returning the sword at the shrine of Shivaji Maharaj."

The narrator points out how Bhosle represents the downfall of the once proud Maharashtrian: the meek and timid Bhosle lets himself be pushed around and humiliated by everyone. The narrator summarizes how middle class men like Bhosle live out their lives. Their middle class earnings barely support their existence and the slightest blip  courts debt. They retire to an uncertain future with dwindling incomes against the rising costs of living, and vanish into insignificance. Bhosle faces several practical troubles. His son Rahul scores just under what is required for admission to an engineering school, and his daughter Shashikala is an aspiring actor. Bhosle approaches the local politician Nandakumar ""Nandya"" Chandekar, his old friend and board member at the engineering school, but Nandya gently turns him down. Shashikala is turned away at auditions because her Maharashtrian name is not as trendy and marketable as the North Indian names. Further, Bhosle is approached by a property developer Gosalia who offers to buy out Bhosle's ancestral home; the home is located centrally in the city and Gosalia wishes to put up a lucrative mall and hotel at that location. Gosalia offers to compensate Bhosle and offer him a new flat in Badlapur outside Mumbai, and remarks that the new location is rife with Maharashtrians. Bhosle is unwilling to move from his location and will consider the offer only if he is able to get new accommodations at the same location. Bhosle's wife Sumitra is enticed by the offer, but Bhosle remains clear about his terms, leading to significant tensions at home. The troubles are worsened when Gosalia applies his connections at the city water works and stops water supply to the Bhosale manor. Bhosale is threatened and confused by these troubles. He attributes them to his Maharashtrian heritage. Late one evening he arrives home drunk and loudly laments his shame and anguish at being born a Maharashtrian. This desperate cry rouses the spirit of Shivaji Maharaj, historical founder of the Maratha Empire. Shivaji Maharaj appears before Bhosle, upset and angry that his own descendant is cursing his name. Bhosle breaks down into tears and pours out his grievances that Maharashtra is overrun by outsiders who now control the industries, offices, trades and markets. Shivaji Maharaj soundly chides him for complaining instead of applying his mind and challenging the outsiders. After a long talk, Shivaji Maharaj convinces Bhosle that it is up to him to shake off his fears and hesitation, and take action to resolve his troubles. Bhosle is heartened by this encounter, and visits the water works manager. Upon discovering that the fellow is on Gosalia's payroll, Bhosle roundly condemns his conduct. He quotes various Maharashtrian proverbs and asks how Maharashtrians can remain proud when it is the very same Maharashtrians who cave to cheap bribes. The manager is ashamed, and restores water. When Gosalia returns with additional bribes, the manager turns him away. Bhosle visits Gidwani  and his boss . He discovers that the producer is, in fact, a Maharashtrian, and he takes him to task until the producer admits his folly and Shashikala gets a part in a Marathi film. Using this money, Bhosle secures funds to obtain the motorbike. His boss tries to question him, but Bhosle is able to answer him with conviction and expose his boss's own corruption. Finally, Bhosle applies a novel strategy to outwit Gosalia. He approaches Mr. Deshmukh, another property developer on his own. The developer studies the matter and approves Bhosle's proposal. Bhosle is able to convince his neighbors to rescind their previous arrangements with Gosalia and accept Bhosle's own proposal. Bhosle also plans to construct a restaurant on some part of the land. For this purpose, he also approaches a big hotel chain owner and offers him a partnership for his new plan. The businessman agrees. Matters take a turn for the worse. Gosalia is visibly angered. He enlists a thug, Usman, to intimidate and threaten Bhosle. Accordingly, Usman visits Bhosle at home and openly threatens his life unless he agrees to Gosalia's proposal. Bhosle refuses. In retaliation, Usman applies his methods upon the young Rahul. Usman chases Rahul's motorbike to scare him. It goes a bit too far and Rahul is flung from his bike, as Shivaji Maharaj intervenes and pushes Rahul out of the way from an oncoming truck. Rahul sustains deep injuries and is taken to the hospital. Once confident, Bhosle is now completely shaken by this physical attack upon his family. Shivaji Maharaj visits him yet again. Bhosle expresses his weaknesses; he simply admits that his enemies are too strong. Shivaji Maharaj uplifts his spirits by arranging a rousing rendition of his own moment of truth during the Afzal Khan incident in the form of a powada. Bhosle recovers his wits, and decides to strike his enemy straight in the heart. He visits Usman at home and claims to have abducted and maimed Usman's son. Usman breaks down.

Bruce goes out to Cybertron to meet Rossum, who shows him a supercomputer called H.A.R.D.A.C., as well as introducing him to his assistant, Randa Duane. Unable to find out more, Bruce makes a date with Randa and leaves. Once he is gone Duane speaks to H.A.R.D.A.C., who scolds her not getting design specifications that it needed.

During one of his sojourns in some remote area in Karnataka he comes across the strange case of a village girl ‘Chenni’ by name, daughter of the village Patel and gets obsessed by her very unusual life. In trying to explore more information about her he discovers that she is a victim of a blind faith. Being a ‘Basavi’ she has to treat any guest to her house as the arrival of God himself. Thus she offers him all the comforts of life and serves him in every possible way. This comes as a big shock to Ananda who belongs to an urban milieu. In spite of her seductive ways he resists from exploiting her. He is warned by a mad soldier, a victim of the most unpredictable happenings during a war not to have anything to do with this unfortunate girl and not to stay in that cursed house. The soldier was taken for dead in a bitter battle. His young and lonely wife remarries. But after many months on an obscure day the soldier returns to find his wife pregnant and married to another man. He losses his mental equilibrium and roams about the village in his desert camouflage. He keeps warning people who come to stay in the Patel’s house. He is very critical of the foolish Patel who sacrificed his only daughter at the altar of the village Deity. Epidemics and wars are similar in nature. In an epidemic a few die and many survive. The epidemic disappears. In a war two neighbors fight some die serving the country, some enemies also die for the sake of their home land. War comes to an end and people live in peace. Ananda does not take he mad soldier’s warning seriously. He wants him not to have anything to do with this unfortunate girl. Ananda in his quest wants to stay on and know more about this mysterious girl. When Chenni comes to him in the night and reveals what she is, he is very shocked. He tries to enlighten her saying that her faith is all rubbish. It is just a myth. He says that God cannot be offered what is not pure and touched. She is made to understand that whatever she has been doing all these years is no different from what a sex worker does. True she may not be doing it for a living but what she has been doing in her blind faith is no different. Then what is the answer. He says that she should lead a normal life. Get married and face life like any other person. But who will come forward in all the villages around to marry her knowing her past. Chenni is prepared to go with Ananda if he can accept her. But Ananda is not bold enough to take the plunge. He succeeded in getting her out of her blind faith but is unable to give her an alternative. Next morning Chenni is missing. A search is on for her. Ultimately she is found dead on the steps of a temple pond. The entire village community looks at Ananda as the guilty one forgetting their own guilt of keeping Chenni an out cast. The mad soldier seems to be the only person who has been sympathetic to Chenni. Unfortunately it is too late. The police arrive and declare that the whole episode as a case of suicide and there is no foul play. But to Ananda it is he who is the cause for Chenni’s death. He accepts his guilt. He was not daring enough to give her a new life."

They commit the crime as an intellectual exercise: they want to prove their superiority by committing the ""perfect murder"". After hiding the body in a large antique wooden chest, Brandon and Phillip host a dinner party at the apartment which has a panoramic view of Manhattan's skyline. The guests, unaware of what has happened, include the victim's father Mr. Kentley  and aunt Mrs. Atwater ; his mother is not able to attend. Also there is his fiancee, Janet Walker  and her former lover Kenneth Lawrence , who was once David's close friend.  In a subtle move, Brandon uses the chest containing the body as a buffet for the food, just before their maid, Mrs. Wilson  arrives to help with the party. ""Now the fun begins"", Brandon says when the first guests arrive. Brandon's and Phillip's idea for the murder was inspired years earlier by conversations with their erstwhile prep-school housemaster, publisher Rupert Cadell . While at school, Rupert had discussed with them, in an apparently approving way, the intellectual concepts of Nietzsche's Übermensch and the art of murder, a means of showing one's superiority over others. He too is among the guests at the party, since Brandon in particular feels that he would very likely approve of their ""work of art"". Brandon's subtle hints about David's absence lead to a discussion on the art of murder. He appears calm and in control, although when he first speaks to Rupert, he is nervously excited, stammering. Phillip, on the other hand, is visibly upset and morose. He does not conceal it well and starts to drink too much. When David's aunt, Mrs. Atwater, who fancies herself as a fortune-teller, tells him that his hands will bring him great fame, she is referring to his skill at the piano, but he appears to think that the ""fame"" will in fact be the notoriety gained from being caught. Much of the conversation, however, focuses on David and his strange absence, which worries the guests. A suspicious Rupert quizzes a fidgety Phillip about this and about some of the inconsistencies that have been raised in conversation. For example, Phillip had vehemently denied ever strangling a chicken at the Shaws’ farm, but Rupert has personally seen Phillip strangle several. Phillip later complains to Brandon about having had a ""rotten evening"", not because of David's murder, but over Rupert's questioning. Emotions run high. David's father and fiancée are disturbed, wondering why he has neither arrived nor phoned. Brandon even goes so far as to increase the tension by playing matchmaker between Janet and Kenneth. Mr. Kentley decides to leave when his wife calls, overwrought because she has not heard a word from David herself. He takes with him some books Brandon has given him, tied together with the very rope Brandon and Phillip used to strangle his son, Brandon's icing on the cake. While leaving, Rupert is handed the wrong hat, with a monogram ""D.K.""  inside it. Rupert returns to the apartment a short while after everyone else has departed, pretending that he has absentmindedly left his cigarette case behind. He 'plants' the case, asks for a drink and then stays to theorize about the disappearance of David, encouraged by Brandon, who seems eager to have Rupert discover the crime. A tipsy Phillip is unable to take it any more, throwing a glass and saying: ""Cat and mouse, cat and mouse. But which is the cat and which is the mouse?"" Rupert lifts the lid of the chest and finds the body inside; his two former students have indeed killed David. He is horrified, but also deeply ashamed, realizing that they used his own rhetoric to rationalize murder. Rupert seizes Brandon's gun and fires several shots into the night in order to attract attention. The films segues to the end titles with the sound of approaching police sirens."

Upon receiving a transmission of unknown origin from a nearby planetoid, the ship's computer awakens the crew.In the script and film the computer is referred to by the crew members as ""Mother"". An October 1979 issue of Fantastic Films magazine, as well as the back of the 1980 Fox videodisk of the film, explain that ""Mother"" is an abbreviation for ""MU/TH/UR 6000"", the model of the computer. The chapter list for Alien in the 2003 Alien Quadrilogy DVD set also lists it as ""MU/TH/UR"". The 1997 sequel Alien Resurrection, the fourth film in the series, echoed this element by having the crew of the Auriga refer to the ship's onboard computer as ""Father."" McIntee, 25, 119. Acting on standing orders from their corporate employers, the crew detaches the Nostromo from the refinery and lands on the planetoid, resulting in some damage to the ship. Captain Dallas , Executive Officer Kane , and Navigator Lambert  set out to investigate the signal's source while Warrant Officer Ripley , Science Officer Ash , and Engineers Brett  and Parker  stay behind to monitor their progress and make repairs. Dallas, Kane, and Lambert discover that the signal is coming from a derelict alien spacecraft. Inside it they find the remains of a large alien creature whose ribs appear to have been forced outward from the inside. Meanwhile, the Nostromo's computer partially deciphers the signal transmission, which Ripley determines to be some type of warning. Kane discovers a vast chamber containing numerous eggs, one of which releases a creature that attaches itself to his face. Dallas and Lambert carry the unconscious Kane back to the Nostromo, where Ash allows them inside against Ripley's orders to follow the ship's quarantine protocol. They unsuccessfully attempt to remove the creature from Kane's face, discovering that its blood is an extremely corrosive acid. Eventually the creature detaches on its own and is found dead. With the ship repaired, the crew resume their trip back to Earth. Kane awakens seemingly unharmed, but during a meal before re-entering stasis he begins to choke and convulse until an alien creature bursts from his chest, killing him and escaping into the ship. Lacking conventional weapons, the crew attempt to locate and capture the creature by fashioning motion trackers, electric prods, and flamethrowers. Brett follows the crew's cat into a large room where the now-fully-grown Alien attacks him and disappears with his body into the ship's air shafts. Dallas enters the shafts intending to force the Alien into an airlock where it can be expelled into space, but it ambushes him. Lambert implores the remaining crew members to escape in the ship's shuttle, but Ripley, now in command, explains that the shuttle will not support four people. Accessing the ship's computer, Ripley discovers that Ash has been ordered to return the Alien to the Nostromo's corporate employers even at the expense of the crew's lives. Ash attacks her, but Parker intervenes and decapitates him with a blow from a fire extinguisher, revealing Ash to be an android. Before Parker incinerates him, Ash predicts that the other crew members will not survive. The remaining three crew members plan to arm the Nostromo's self-destruct mechanism and escape in the shuttle, but Parker and Lambert are killed by the Alien while gathering the necessary supplies. Ripley initiates the self-destruct sequence and heads for the shuttle with the cat, but finds the Alien blocking her way. She unsuccessfully attempts to abort the self-destruct, then returns to find the Alien gone and narrowly escapes in the shuttle as the Nostromo explodes. As she prepares to enter stasis, Ripley discovers that the Alien is aboard the shuttle. She puts on a space suit and opens the hatch, causing explosive decompression which forces the Alien to the open doorway. She shoots it with a grappling gun which propels it out, but the gun is yanked from her hands and catches in the closing door, tethering the Alien to the shuttle. It attempts to crawl into one of the engines, but Ripley activates them and blasts the Alien into space. She then puts herself and the cat into stasis for the return trip to Earth."

After trying to get them, only to see the gophers dive into their hole and then overrun the hole and off a cliff, the dog  discovers four ways to get a gopher: * No. 1: The canny hunter will remember that gophers possess an enormous curiosity concerning strange or unfamiliar objects: To this end, the dog places a spring with a punching glove attached to it in a chest. When the Gophers, after deciding to ignore the ""Do Not Open until Xmas"" sticker, open it, they ""see"" jewelry in it and take the chest with them. The dog takes the chest away from the Gophers and opens it, only to be punched below his chin, as he bounces like a pogo stick. * No. 2: Gophers are quite fond of fresh vegetables which can therefore be used as bait that would attract them: The dog, knowing that the gophers are vegetarians, plants a row of radishes in the ground along with a turnip at the end of the row that is booby-trapped to an overhanging rock tied around a nearby tree, which the dog tests with a ball, triggering the trap successfully. Naturally, the Gophers pick up all of the radishes, and after initial trouble, take the turnip—but the trap is not triggered this time. The dog then holds the string, but triggers the trap and says to himself ""Oh,No."" before he is crushed. * No. 3: The gopher is a sentimental little creature whose feelings may be played upon to your advantage: The dog, calling himself Snookie, places himself in a booby-trapped carriage, with his cries quickly noticed by the Gophers. After discovering the booby trap under the dog , the Gophers push the carriage up a hill, and then release the carriage with the dog in it down the cliff on the other side, leaving the dog howling as he goes over several hills  and vertically down a second cliff, where he crashes. As the dog claims that the Gophers missed his inner strength, the dog then falls down, stiff as a board. * No. 4: If all else fails,  you must utilize the gophers' love of music: The dog begins playing what amounts to a one-man band of music, drawing the Gophers' attention as they start dancing to the music. The dog unsuccessfully tries to crush them with cymbals and a banjo that also doubles as a gun, but does drag them to the drums using a trumpet. As the dog tries to crush the gophers on the drums, they evade him and the dog and Gophers end up in the piano, where the Gophers have the dog ""trapped like a rat in a trap"", as the Gophers then hop all over the piano keys.

Driving alone, confused and somewhat dazed, she nearly hits a pedestrian. The two go for a coffee and end up spending the night in a diner so that she can file a report, but Gilles, the pedestrian, has fallen in love with her by the next morning. He asks her for a date, and while she accepts, she remains coldly indifferent toward him. Unfulfilled and aimless, Gilles has recently come back from a trip to New York, bringing with him, Bernard, a friend he met there. Bernard is an unemployed aspiring musician and would-be serial seducer whose only real occupation is to enjoy the moment and spend time with his steady girlfriend, Colette, a cheerful post office clerk worker. Gilles’s mother runs the Hotel de la Gare with his younger sister, Elise. This fact makes life uncomplicated for the two friends who live for free at the hotel. Bernard would like to seduce Elise, a heavy reader who never goes out and repeatedly turns him down. Keen about his developing relationship with Hélène, Gilles invites her to a restaurant at the local casino. They have dinner with Bernard and Colette, but the occasion ends up in discord. Hélène clearly dislikes Bernard’s attitude and Gilles confronts her. Bernard is his friend and Gilles is disappointed of her air of superiority. He backs off from the relationship suspecting that she could never really love someone less well off than her. Gilles’s disenchantment has the opposite effect on Hélène and she is unable to let him go. Hélène looks for him and they eventually sleep together in his mother's hotel, initiating a serious relationship. Gilles finds a job as a tourist guide and paints Hélène beach front apartment. However her past become to haunt their relationship. She is still mourning the death of her former lover, an architect who drown in Biarritz more than a year ago. It was in fact his tragic death what brought her to Biarritz, where she has few friends: Jacqueline the waitress at the cafe by the station where she had her first encounter with Gilles and Rudel, an older surgeon and who like Jacqueline is a frequent gambler at the casino. Many years ago Hélène and Rudel were lovers and he introduced her to the architect. Hélène has inherited La Salamandre a big abandoned house outside town, where the architect was planning to live with. The house is still in disrepair, but after taking Gilles there he insists in leaving the beachfront apartment and move to La Salamandre. Meanwhile, Bernard runs into trouble. First he had an argument with Gilles about Hélène. Cruising at night in a park he encounters Luc, Collette’s gay friend and coworker, who attempts to pick him up, but he is assaulted by Bernard, as a result. A subsequent police investigation discovers stolen items in Bernard’s hotel room. Bernard is arrested and has to spend some time in jail, to Colette’s dismay. Moving to La Salamandre proves to be a bad idea as the place is cold and far from town. Living there only complicates the relationship. As Hélène starts to warm up to Gilles over time and opens up her personal life, he becomes increasingly temperamental, displaying a possessive and unpredictable personality that threatens to drive them apart just as they are getting closer. He proposed to make a trip to London but backs down at the last moment. Moody and unstable, Gilles gets drunk and makes a scene by the beach. While Hélène, is looking after him, he slaps her. This furthers Hélène disillusionment towards Gilles. She decides to leave Biarritz behind and return to Paris. Once on the train, she tears up a photo of Gilles, but she is unable to bring herself to throw it out the windows. Gilles has once again dreams of leaving town with Bernard, his eternal friend who has been released from jail and wants to leave Biarritz. But everything changes.

Driving alone, confused and somewhat dazed, she nearly hits a pedestrian. The two go for a coffee and end up spending the night in a diner so that she can file a report, but Gilles, the pedestrian, has fallen in love with her by the next morning. He asks her for a date, and while she accepts, she remains coldly indifferent toward him. Unfulfilled and aimless, Gilles has recently come back from a trip to New York, bringing with him, Bernard, a friend he met there. Bernard is an unemployed aspiring musician and would-be serial seducer whose only real occupation is to enjoy the moment and spend time with his steady girlfriend, Colette, a cheerful post office clerk worker. Gilles’s mother runs the Hotel de la Gare with his younger sister, Elise. This fact makes life uncomplicated for the two friends who live for free at the hotel. Bernard would like to seduce Elise, a heavy reader who never goes out and repeatedly turns him down. Keen about his developing relationship with Hélène, Gilles invites her to a restaurant at the local casino. They have dinner with Bernard and Colette, but the occasion ends up in discord. Hélène clearly dislikes Bernard’s attitude and Gilles confronts her. Bernard is his friend and Gilles is disappointed of her air of superiority. He backs off from the relationship suspecting that she could never really love someone less well off than her. Gilles’s disenchantment has the opposite effect on Hélène and she is unable to let him go. Hélène looks for him and they eventually sleep together in his mother's hotel, initiating a serious relationship. Gilles finds a job as a tourist guide and paints Hélène beach front apartment. However her past become to haunt their relationship. She is still mourning the death of her former lover, an architect who drown in Biarritz more than a year ago. It was in fact his tragic death what brought her to Biarritz, where she has few friends: Jacqueline the waitress at the cafe by the station where she had her first encounter with Gilles and Rudel, an older surgeon and who like Jacqueline is a frequent gambler at the casino. Many years ago Hélène and Rudel were lovers and he introduced her to the architect. Hélène has inherited La Salamandre a big abandoned house outside town, where the architect was planning to live with. The house is still in disrepair, but after taking Gilles there he insists in leaving the beachfront apartment and move to La Salamandre. Meanwhile, Bernard runs into trouble. First he had an argument with Gilles about Hélène. Cruising at night in a park he encounters Luc, Collette’s gay friend and coworker, who attempts to pick him up, but he is assaulted by Bernard, as a result. A subsequent police investigation discovers stolen items in Bernard’s hotel room. Bernard is arrested and has to spend some time in jail, to Colette’s dismay. Moving to La Salamandre proves to be a bad idea as the place is cold and far from town. Living there only complicates the relationship. As Hélène starts to warm up to Gilles over time and opens up her personal life, he becomes increasingly temperamental, displaying a possessive and unpredictable personality that threatens to drive them apart just as they are getting closer. He proposed to make a trip to London but backs down at the last moment. Moody and unstable, Gilles gets drunk and makes a scene by the beach. While Hélène, is looking after him, he slaps her. This furthers Hélène disillusionment towards Gilles. She decides to leave Biarritz behind and return to Paris. Once on the train, she tears up a photo of Gilles, but she is unable to bring herself to throw it out the windows. Gilles has once again dreams of leaving town with Bernard, his eternal friend who has been released from jail and wants to leave Biarritz. But everything changes. Even the Hotel de la Gare, which by the will of a new owner, has been renamed Hôtel des Amériques. The place has been remodeled and there is party to celebrate its reopening. At the inauguration party, Colette ends in tears when Luc tells her that Bernard has left town with some money he gave him after he forgave him for the beating.

On a horse riding trip out in the desert one day, Elizabeth comes across an illegal immigration deal gone bad, with gangster Jimmy Dolan  executing a man. Elizabeth is seen, however, and narrowly escapes Dolan's thugs firing at her. The Robinsons go to the authorities, and an official  admits them into the Witness Protection program. Soon after, Elizabeth rushes out of their hotel, Tom following after her. When she tries to start their car, it explodes in front of Tom, killing Elizabeth. Devastated, Tom begins drinking, and eventually decides to seek revenge against Dolan. He purchases a handgun, a massive Smith & Wesson Model 500, and follows Dolan around town, eventually going after him one night. But before he can take the shot, a rival business of Dolan's pulls a drive-by, which fails because Dolan's Cadillac is revealed to be bulletproof. Robinson continues to follow Dolan, who soon notices and learns his identity. The two meet at a Rest Stop in the Nevada desert, ending with a confrontation in which Dolan allows Robinson to live , believing life to be more painful for Robinson than death. Undeterred, Robinson gets a job with a construction crew working on the roads Dolan often travels. After strenuous preparation, Robinson sets his trap: a giant pothole deep in the road, large enough to trap a car but not so large as to allow Dolan to escape. When Dolan's car falls into the hole, the driver is killed and another passenger , whom Dolan shoots as a mercy killing , is injured. Once Dolan has been trapped, Robinson makes his presence known, telling Dolan that he is a motorist who witnessed what had happened. Dolan, however, eventually realizes that the motorist is, in fact, Robinson, and begins to beg Robinson to let him go. Robinson begins to fill up the pot hole with dirt, continuing to taunt Dolan with possibilities of his escape, none of which come to fruition. The official from the Witness Protection program soon calls Robinson to tell him that Dolan had been on his way to a major transaction involving child sex trafficking, a crime that would have destroyed Dolan. Robinson doesn't care, however, and finishes filling the hole up. Robinson lays concrete blocks over the Cadillac, while Dolan screams from within the hole. The official calls back and tells Robinson they now have enough for a conviction. Robinson drops the phone and laughs maniacally.

But his honesty only brings him a demotion and humiliation. After making concessions to a client for the company, Harpreet realizes that sales success is dependent on the customer. No one agrees with him but Harpreet remains firm on his belief and forms his own company in Rocket Sales Corporation. Other disgruntled employees find their way to Rocket Sales — a place where even the guy who serves tea is an equal partner because he brings talent to the table. The company soon becomes successful because of its dedication to excellent customer service. The MD of AYS, Sunil Puri, becomes angered by the small company's success.

However, AYS is unable to maintain Rocket Sales' commitment to customer satisfaction because of its cold and greedy personnel. The MD, realizing his downfall in purchasing Rocket Sales, visits Harpreet at his new job at Croma, an electronics store, and returns the contract to Harpreet in return for Rs. 1. He also tells him never to become a businessman again, because he will fail again. However, this is not intended as an insult, but rather as a compliment; he implies that what made Harpreet so successful was his eschewing of 'normal' business practices such as kick-backs, false advertisement, and low wages. The ending scene is the new Rocket Sales office building where a prospective worker is going in for an interview. It shows the former employees, all partners of the business, and finally closes with Harpreet smiling genially at a desk, showing that eventually honesty and hard work is a sound business decision.

A qualified attorney, she is doing her best to ensure that her two children, Jeremy and Elisabeth, never see their father again. Tim arrives to pick the children up for what is believed to be one last time. He fails to return with the children. Nathalie's dog disappears under mysterious circumstances and she then discovers a piece of paper with the word ""Dard""  written in blood in her house. Panicked, she calls the police, who cannot help without more evidence of a crime. She decides to meet Tim and the children in Chinatown, but they do not show up. In the evening, Tim suddenly appears at the house, apparently badly injured. Before dying, he tells Nathalie that the children have been abducted. She immediately informs the police, but when the detective, James Gates, arrives, the body is gone and the site has been cleaned up leaving no evidence that Nathalie is telling the truth. Later a police officer, Phil Warren arrives to question Nathalie. Warren is revealed to be corrupt and overpowers Nathalie. Graphically depicted in flashback, he tells Nathalie that Tim had been hired by the Persian Mafioso Maho and had burst in on a drug deal organised by Maho, killing those present before running off with a million dollars in cash and the cocaine. Convinced that the drugs are hidden in the house, he tells her he has killed her son Jeremy with a chainsaw and will kill Elisabeth as well if he is not told where drugs and money are, Warren then tortures Nathalie in an attempt to get the information out of her, cutting off a finger and a toe with pruning shears. Nathalie eventually manages to break free and kills Warren with a broken bottle. Then a mysterious man by the name of Daniel appears who informs her he had been following Warren. He offers to help her, tends to her wounds and calms her down. His story is somewhat different  - that Tim had chanced upon a drug deal that had gone bad and that he had got hold of the two cases entirely innocently before disappearing. However, it is then revealed that Daniel's intentions are less honourable than they appeared - he drugs Nathalie and disposes of Warren's body. Daniel explains how he tortured and killed Nathalie's loved ones before torturing Nathalie herself with a hammer. Although under the effects of a local anaesthesia, she head-butts Daniel and is able to plunge a hypodermic into his eye before killing him with a knife. Severely wounded, she clambers up the stairs when the phone begins to a ring. It is Detective Gates who is also corrupt. Gates sends her daughter Elisabeth in and points a sniper rifle at her head, ordering Nathalie to reveal the location of the money and drugs and to not move or he will shoot her daughter. Remembering their dogs disappearance, Nathalie suspects it has something to do with where the money is buried so Nathalie and Elisabeth attempt to come up with the answer through a riddle posed in one of Tim's old children's songs which reveals the location to them. As Nathalie bends to pick up a pencil however, Gates shoots Elisabeth in the shoulder. Nathalie picks up Daniel's pistol and shoots Gates as he enters the house. Nathalie runs alone to the cornfield and meets Tim there, who has their son. The true story is revealed - Gates had employed Tim as an informer and was supposed to give him Moha. As Gates was one of the most corrupt cops in the precinct, Tim was ordered to kill Maha and bring him the drugs and money. Tim slipped some E 605 into the coffee at the diner killing the mafiosi and then shoots the other party when they arrive to make the deal. Nathalie was his last obstacle but, as Tim is about to shoot her, he is shot by his daughter Elisabeth from behind. Nathalie and the children begin a new life."

Adolescent children, Seenu and Amaravathi, are friends who love to spend time at the village's lake, with the Seenu going on an endless search for pearls in the water for Amaravathi. While Amaravathi is the daughter of a rich man in the village, Seenu is the son of his maidservant. Amaravathi's father does not like the closeness Seenu shares with Amaravathi and warns his mother against their friendship. One day, after searching for hours, Seenu ultimately finds the 10 pearls in the lake, which he decides to take to Amaravathi. Amaravathi always wants 10 of everything - a detail that will later become an important clue in the mystery of the story. Amaravathi's father beats Seenu when he sees him trying to get to her. Later, thinking that her father has left, Seenu goes up to Amaravathi's room. But the two are caught together by Amaravathi's father who suddenly returns. Upon seeing them having fallen down on top of each other by accident, Amaravathi's father suspects a physical relationship between the two, and so he slits the throat of Seenu. He then throws him into the lake, and runs Seenu's mother over with his jeep when she ran over to try to save her son. After the credits roll, a series of macabre incidents are shown in which an unidentified person goes about cutting babies from the wombs of several 9-month pregnant mothers. Another parallel story is also revealed where Venkat  an Agent of the Special Task Force, has been taking care of his wife, Latha , for the last fifteen months due to having a self-inflicted bullet injury. But soon, Venkat is enlisted by his superiors to take on the case of the womb-raider. It is later revealed that the criminal is now after Latha, who is also 9 months pregnant! The rest of the film deals with how the womb-raider is related to the story of Seenu  and Amaravathi , why the criminal is after Latha and how Venkat saves his wife and child from the criminal.

Dre develops a crush on a young violinist, Mei Ying, who reciprocates his attention, but Cheng, a rebellious kung fu prodigy whose family is close to Mei Ying's, attempts to keep them apart by beating Dre, and later bullies him at school. After a field trip to the Forbidden City, Dre encounters Cheng and his friends hanging out close to his apartment. Dre tries to pass by without them seeing him. When he finds a bucket of water catching overflow from a steam vent, Dre gets revenge by splashing dirty water over Cheng. Cheng and the others catch Dre and beat him. During the attack, the enigmatic maintenance man of Dre's building, Mr. Han, comes to Dre's aid, revealing himself as a kung fu master who dispatches Dre's tormentors. After Han mends Dre's injuries using fire cupping, Dre asks if Mr. Han could teach him kung fu. Han refuses, but meets Cheng's teacher, Master Li, to make peace. Li, who teaches his students to show no mercy to their enemies, challenges Dre to a fight with Cheng. When Han declines, Li says they will not be allowed to leave his school unless Dre or Han fights. Han acquiesces, but insists the fight take place at an upcoming tournament, and that Li's students leave Dre alone until the tournament. Li agrees, but tells Han that if Dre does not show up during the tournament he will personally bring pain to Han and Dre. Dre is shocked when Han tells him that he will fight in a kung fu tournament. Han promises to teach Dre ""real"" kung fu. Han begins training Dre, but Dre is frustrated that Han merely has him spend hours taking off his jacket, hanging it up, dropping it and putting it on again. After days of this, Dre refuses to continue until Han demonstrates that the repetitive arm movements were Han's method of teaching Dre martial arts techniques, which Dre displays instinctively when prompted by Han's mock attacks. Han emphasizes that the movements Dre is learning apply to life in general, and that serenity and maturity, not punches and power, are the true keys to mastering the martial arts. As Dre's friendship with Mei Ying continues, Dre persuades Mei Ying to cut school for a day of fun, but when she is nearly late for her violin audition which was preceded in a day without their knowledge, her parents deem him a bad influence and forbid her from spending more time with him. When Dre finds Han drunk, despondent and breaking the car he had in his living room, Dre learns that it is the anniversary of Han's wife and son's deaths, which occurred when he lost control of the car due to anger caused from an argument he was having with his wife. Dre reminds Han that one of his lessons was in perseverance, and that Han needs to heal from his loss. Han assists Dre in reading a note of apology to Mei Ying's father in Chinese; he accepts and promises that he and Mei Ying will attend the tournament to support Dre. At the tournament, the under-confident Dre is slow to achieve parity with his opponents, but soon begins beating them and advances to the semifinals, as does Cheng, who violently finishes off his opponents. Dre comes up against Liang, another of Li's students, who is instructed by Li to injure Dre's leg. When Liang insists that he can beat Dre, Li sternly tells him that he does not want him beaten, but broken. Although Liang is disqualified for his illegal strikes and insubordination, Dre is badly injured. Despite Han's insistence that he has earned respect for his performance, Dre convinces Han to mend his leg by using fire cupping in order to continue. Dre returns to the arena, facing Cheng. Dre delivers impressive blows, but Cheng counters with a strike to Dre's injured leg. Dre struggles to get up, and attempts the reflection technique to manipulate Cheng into changing his attack stance. Cheng charges Dre, but Dre flips and catches Cheng with a kick to his head, winning the tournament along with the respect of Cheng and his classmates. Cheng awards Dre the trophy, instead of the presenter and the Fighting Dragon students bow to Mr.Han."

A number of smaller hounds come out of a giant dog house, followed by a large fox hound  who is excited by the prospect of the hunt- especially the moment where the fox's tail is to be cut off. The hunters and dogs then pass over Bugs' hole, waking him, with the larger fox hound lagging behind. Once Bugs directs the larger fox hound to where the others went, Bugs digs out a fox costume he had from his hole and begins to play tricks with the large fox hound, leaving Bugs amazed at the dog's inability to recognize a rabbit from a fox. Once the large hound realizes the difference, he runs back to the tree where Bugs was standing, only to find Bugs undressed. The rabbit giggles at the dog's intelligence, declaring, ""I've seen better heads on a glass of root beer!"". At this point, Bugs  stamps fox tracks to mislead this hound, which lead to train tracks, which the dog continues to follow. When the dog finally reaches Bugs  and tries to get him, Bugs questions what kind of tracks the dog was following, which ends up putting the dog on the front of a locomotive, while the dog exclaims that he caught a train. Meanwhile, the other dogs have caught up to Bugs in his costume, and he tries to evade them, but to no avail. When he reveals that he is a rabbit, one of the dogs  declares that they are now after rabbits. After a short chase, which includes Bugs running through an open log, Bugs then runs back into the log, and while the dogs run into it, Bugs turns the log three times to ensure that the crowd of dogs always run off the cliff, with the crowd falling to the ground after the third turn. While Bugs is chuckling at their misfortune, the large fox hound sneaks up behind Bugs, cuts Bugs' tail off, and runs away with the tail. Bugs shrugs to the audience, ""Just call me Stubby!"".

Mahler catches up and tries to kill Nicole, but the two narrowly escape. Milo is not interested in explanations until Nicole admits that she's found evidence that implicates their mutual friend, Bobby , Milo's ex-partner on the police force. Angry, Milo decides to investigate the crime with her. Clues from Earl's car lead them to a country club, where they learn from a caddy that Earl owns a tattoo parlor in Queens, so they start to make their way there. Bobby warns the pair to stay off the road. By coincidence, the nearest hotel is ""Cupid's Cabin,"" the bed and breakfast where they spent their honeymoon. They have feelings for each other and they both admit they have made mistakes [from the divorce]. She calls her mother on advice what to do. When she is done, she comes out of the bathroom and overhears Milo telling Sid that he may or may not sleep with Nicole that night, but he's taking her to jail nevertheless. Infuriated, she handcuffs Milo to the bed and makes her way to the tattoo parlor herself, finding Jimmy and freeing him before she is captured by Irene's thugs, still looking for Milo. Milo manages to rescues her at a strip club. He calls an old friend from the police force and learns that Bobby is on his way to the police's evidence warehouse, which is being relocated to a new building. Bobby confronts Earl, who used to be his friend but has used Bobby's name to gain access to the warehouse and steal a large amount of confiscated narcotics and cash. Bobby decides to arrest Earl, but Earl draws a gun and shoots him, though not fatally. Milo and Nicole enter the warehouse and Milo is ambushed, but Earl is forced to surrender when Nicole points a shotgun at him. Bobby explains that Earl was using him, as well as the man who supposedly committed suicide, to gain access to the warehouse. There was no proof, so Bobby was waiting for Earl to make his move before arresting him. Milo proudly notes that Earl might have gotten away with it if Nicole hadn't picked up certain clues. He and Nicole appear to have reconciled. They concede that sometimes their jobs have to come first. By way of demonstrating this, Milo then turns Nicole into the police, so she can make her court hearing the next day. On his way out of the precinct, Milo runs into a cop who insulted him earlier and punches him in the face. He is arrested and put in a cell next to Nicole's.

Clues from Earl's car lead them to a country club, where they learn from a caddy that Earl owns a tattoo parlor in Queens, so they start to make their way there. Bobby warns the pair to stay off the road. By coincidence, the nearest hotel is ""Cupid's Cabin,"" the bed and breakfast where they spent their honeymoon. They have feelings for each other and they both admit they have made mistakes [from the divorce]. She calls her mother on advice what to do. When she is done, she comes out of the bathroom and overhears Milo telling Sid that he may or may not sleep with Nicole that night, but he's taking her to jail nevertheless. Infuriated, she handcuffs Milo to the bed and makes her way to the tattoo parlor herself, finding Jimmy and freeing him before she is captured by Irene's thugs, still looking for Milo. Milo manages to rescues her at a strip club. He calls an old friend from the police force and learns that Bobby is on his way to the police's evidence warehouse, which is being relocated to a new building. Bobby confronts Earl, who used to be his friend but has used Bobby's name to gain access to the warehouse and steal a large amount of confiscated narcotics and cash. Bobby decides to arrest Earl, but Earl draws a gun and shoots him, though not fatally. Milo and Nicole enter the warehouse and Milo is ambushed, but Earl is forced to surrender when Nicole points a shotgun at him. Bobby explains that Earl was using him, as well as the man who supposedly committed suicide, to gain access to the warehouse. There was no proof, so Bobby was waiting for Earl to make his move before arresting him. Milo proudly notes that Earl might have gotten away with it if Nicole hadn't picked up certain clues. He and Nicole appear to have reconciled. They concede that sometimes their jobs have to come first. By way of demonstrating this, Milo then turns Nicole into the police, so she can make her court hearing the next day. On his way out of the precinct, Milo runs into a cop who insulted him earlier and punches him in the face. He is arrested and put in a cell next to Nicole's. He reminds her that it is their anniversary and they have to spend it together, no matter what. Through the bars they admit their love to each other and kiss."

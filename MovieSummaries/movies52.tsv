Not wanting to pay full price for three ski lift tickets, Dan convinces Parker to bribe the ski lift attendant Jason  to let them all on the ski lift. On the way up, the ski lift shuts down, but starts back up again shortly. After spending all afternoon watching Parker fall over herself because she cannot snowboard, the guys are eager to take one last run down the mountain before they go home. However, it is now evening, and the ski resort decides to close early because a storm is moving in. The friends remind Jason of the bribe and convince him to let them on the ski lift one last time. At this point the resort is almost deserted. Before the group gets all the way to the top, Jason is called into the boss's office and is replaced by a co-worker Rifkin . As Jason leaves, he tells Rifkin that there are only three skiers left and then the ski lift can be shut down. Another set of three skiers comes down the mountain. When Rifkin sees them, he shuts down the ski lift stranding the three central characters in their ski lift chair far above the ground. The friends are first annoyed as they assume that there's another technical difficulty with the ski lift. A few minutes later, however, the lights go out scaring the three skiers. Night has come and a snow storm moves in. After a while, a snowcat comes along and it seems as if the driver Cody  is about to see them. However, at the last second, Cody is called back to base. After several hours, the friends realize that no one is coming to get them and that they could be stuck up there all week, as the resort is closed on weekdays. Parker then loses her right glove while smoking. Dan realizes he has no choice but to jump from the ski lift chair and get help, as they will not survive up there in the bitter cold until Friday. Dan jumps off the lift onto a hard section of the ski path and suffers a compound fracture in both of his legs. Later on, he is approached by a wolf who growls at him, but Parker throws her snowboard at it and it runs away. Joe, now fearing for Dan's safety, decides to climb up and traverse the ski lift cable so that he can get to a chair that is closer to the ground. However, after traversing a few feet, he returns to his chair with his gloves cut and holds Parker, to prevent her watching the scene below. Dan has now been surrounded by a pack of wolves who devour him, horrifying Parker and Joe. Later on, Joe and Parker have a fight in which Joe furiously accuses Parker of being too insensitive and only caring about herself, while Parker blames him for not dissuading Dan from jumping. However, they soon make up. In the morning, Parker wakes up with her right hand stuck to the ski lift safety bar, which she has grabbed in her sleep. She painfully pulls it free, losing skin in the process. In addition, she has developed a bad case of frostbite on her face. After a few hours, Joe climbs up, traverses the ski lift cable, severely cutting his gloves in the process, and this time safely climbs down the ladder of a support pole two chairs back. At the same time, Parker's ski lift chair begins tipping as it has started to loosen from its supporting cable. After fighting off a pair of wolves by using a ski pole, Joe slides down the mountain on Parker's snowboard, planning to return with help for her; the wolves chase after him. Another night passes and no one has shown up to help Parker. She now realizes that something has happened to Joe. The next day, she begins to attempt to jump down herself, but the bolt holding the lift chair fails; the chair drops some twenty feet but is caught by a supporting cable. Parker jumps down, now from a fairly safe height, but is injured after the lift chair falls on her ankle. She then alternately slides and crawls down the mountain, pausing when she sees a streak of blood in the snow and is then approached by a wolf. After sizing her up, the wolf returns to the nearby pack, Parker sees that the pack has caught and killed Joe and is now finishing off his remains. Completely traumatized, Parker makes it the rest of the way down the mountain to a nearby road. Eventually a car appears and the driver stops to assist her. While driving, the man calls the hospital and tells them that he had found a girl hurt outside of the ski resort.

He chases them and manages to click photos of the robbers. When he tries to escape, he is stopped by a young woman Renuka ‘Renu’  who assumes he is the culprit and helps the robbers to take his camera. However, he is able to secure the memory card of the camera. The police catch him, and to prove that he is a press photographer he shows the photos to the them, who identify everyone except the gang leader . At his office, he again meets Renuka, who has newly joined as Article Editor. Saraswathi ‘Saro’  also works in his office and has feelings for Ashwin, who does not reciprocate. Settled in her new job, Renuka writes a cover story about a politician Aalavandhan , describing his attempt to marry a minor. Enraged by this, Aalavandhan barges into the newspaper office and shouts at Renuka. The audio recording of her interview disappears , and she is fired from her job for falsified reporting. Ashwin later risks his life to capture the pictures of Aalavandhan who actually engages in child marriage in a temple at midnight. Later the story with the photos is printed in their newspaper and this makes Renuka to fall in love with him, which Ashwin reciprocates. Saro is initially jealous of the love between Ashwin and Renuka, but later accepts it and gets over Ashwin. Ashwin marries Renuka with the blessings of their parents. Meanwhile, Vasanthan Perumal , a recent graduate and engineer, strives hard to enter the politics by contesting the upcoming election. He is contesting against more experienced politicians who capture the people by giving freebies and money. No one cares about Vasanthan and his team of graduates, who promise a healthy government to people. Their party name is 'Siragugal' . Ashwin and Renuka find out about Vasanthan's election campaign, and they and the entire Dina Anjal team extend their support to the campaign, covering it extensively, much to the chagrin of Aalavandhan and the Chief Minister Yogeswaran 'Yogi' . One night, Vasanthan's party organises an election campaign meeting. Ashwin, photographing the event, receives a text message from Saro that states there is a bomb underneath the stage where Vasanthan is speaking. Ashwin manages to save Vasanthan just before the bomb explodes. Later, Ashwin finds Saro fatally wounded near the blast site. Saro struggles to tell something to Ashwin and Renuka before she dies. Ashwin, through a video clip recorded by another photographer, finds out that Saro was intentionally killed by someone. He later notices a resemblance between the leader of the bank robbery and this unknown killer, concluding that the Naxalite leader killed Saro. A few days later, Renuka notices that Vasanthan's photo in their newspaper was cut from a college class photo, where Ashwin is also present. Confronted by Renuka, Ashwin tells her that he and Vasanthan studied in the same college and were best friends. He also tells her that he is happy for Vasanthan's success and is wholeheartedly supporting his election campaign. In the election, Vasanthan's party wins by a huge majority and Vasanthan becomes the Chief Minister. He orders the release of 20 naxals on Republic Day, citing humanity. Shocked on hearing this news, Ashwin rushes to the secretariat to meet Vasanthan. In Vasanthan's office, Ashwin notices that the Naxalite leader who killed Saro is there, talking with Vasanthan. Ashwin airs his grievances to Vasanthan, who ignores him. Ashwin then follows the leader to his hideout. At the same time, Vasanthan orders the Tamil Nadu Police to go kill the Naxals at their hideout and the Police Commandos surround the perimeter of that place. Ashwin, already at the hideout, confronts the Naxalite leader, whose name is Kadhir  and finds out from him that Vasanthan had made a deal with the Naxalites to help him win the election. They orchestrated events such as the burning of a hut and saving the woman in that hut  in order to win people's sympathy. In the same vein, they had planted a bomb on the stage where Vasanthan was speaking during his meeting. Saro had found out the truth about Vasanthan, but was fatally assaulted by him so that she does not reveal his character and intentions to anybody. Ashwin realises that Saro had tried to warn him and Renuka about Vasanthan's true character before dying and also that now Vasanthan is double-crossing the Naxalites and is planning to kill them as a show of achievement. Ashwin records this confession using his mobile phone camera and sends it to Renuka, who plans to publish this story in their newspaper. Vasanthan then arrives and kills Kadhir. He also tries to kill Ashwin. However, Ashwin triggers a bomb there which explodes, killing Vasanthan, while Ashwin manages to escape. Meanwhile, Vasanthan's party members arrive at the hideout on hearing the news that Vasanthan had died. Seeing their innocence, Ashwin forces Renuka not to reveal the truth about Vasanthan because his party members would get into serious trouble and lose their seats just for supporting Vasanthan. They did not know about Vasanthan's true character and intentions and supported him, believing his false claims of a 'healthy government'. Instead Renuka publishes an article saying that Vasanthan had sacrificed his life fighting the Naxalites and died as a martyr. The film ends with Ashwin and Renuka submitting their resignations to the Chief Editor for falsified reporting, but he rejects their resignations and tells them to cover the upcoming election.

Mysterious Hal Leuco has hired several assassins to take out Weed on April 19 at exactly 3:00am. These include Ariella Martinez, a femme fatale who kills her victims with exotic poisons; Finbar McTeague who is also known as ""The Surgeon"", who brutally tortures his victims; the Southern Tremor family consisting of father Fritz and children; Lester, Kaitlyn, Baby Boy, and finally Lazlo Soot who is a master of disguise assassin. An FBI unit, led by Special Agent Zane Baker secures Weed in a Chicago lounge called the: ""Little Jazz After Hours Club."" The bar, run by Special Agent Malcolm Little has a bunker deep below it and several lines of defense stand between the assassins and Weed, locked down inside of it with Baker and Agents Nicholas and Redstone. On the surface, Agent Dominic Dumare, Little, Abrego, Salerno, and an entire unit of FBI agents act as patrons or staff at the bar. The assassins enter the city in separate manners, all ready to meet the 3am deadline. McTeague and Martinez meet in the bar while the Tremors kill the agents on the roof across from the bar and prepare to storm the bar. Soot kills Agent Dumare in his hotel room and disguises himself as him, allowing him access to the bunker. Eight minutes before the deadline, McTeague and Martinez working together create a hostage situation where McTeague holds Martinez hostage, creating a Mexican standoff between the assassins and the FBI agents. The standoff escalates when the Tremors fire a clown with a bomb strapped to him through the bar doors. A shootout ensues; however, the agents and the assassins are unable to kill each other. Martinez breaks cover and kills some of the agents including Salerno, before being shot and wounded. McTeague takes her to a closet where he cradles her as she dies. At this point, the Tremors break into the bar, firing heavy machine guns and killing all of the agents save for Little who escapes. McTeague, angry at Martinez's death fights Baby Boy, attaching an explosive to him before being gunned down by Lester and Fritz; the explosive that explodes within the body then kills Baby Boy. Meanwhile, Soot has escaped the firefight and still disguised as Dumare, convinces Abrego to let him into the secure area. He then double-crosses Abrego and kills him. Before he dies, Abrego manages to pull off Soot's mask, ruining his disguise. The Tremors breach the elevator and kill the last remaining agents outside of the bunker. Soot takes an agent hostage and threatens to kill him unless Baker opens the bunker door, but Baker refuses. At the same time, the Tremors fire a rocket-propelled grenade at the door, which Soot narrowly escapes. Kaitlyn, who has penetrated the tunnels next to the bunker, blows a hole in it and starts firing on the agents inside, trying to kill Weed. Nicholas is killed protecting him just before Baker shoots and kills Kaitlyn. With only two minutes to go, Weed suddenly tries to open the bunker door and reveals he has C4 hidden under his wheelchair and is rigged to a dead man switch. Redstone tries to shoot Weed but is wounded by Baker who attempts to talk Weed down. Weed says that he must die to kill the assassins, who have committed heinous acts against America and that by blowing himself up, Weed will be hailed as a patriotic hero for killing the assassins when he dies. Realising Weed will not back down, Baker drags the wounded Redstone to the ""spider trap"", a hole in the bunker's floor, which can be used to safeguard people from the bunker collapsing. Weed detonates the C4, destroying both the bunker and the bar. Baker is unable to get Redstone into the spider trap and can only save himself. Fritz is critically wounded by the bomb and begs for help from Lester, who coldly kills him for abusing him for years. Not long after, Baker emerges from the spider trap and comes out of the ruins of the bar to find emergency services securing the area, with only Little and Baker surviving out of the FBI agents. Baker is approached by Special Agent Anthony Vejar who asks him if he saw Weed die, telling him that Vejar's unit believes that Weed was also Hal Leuco who works for a CIA elite black ops unit. With a combined career in both the FBI and CIA, Weed/Leuco was able to access information about the assassins and used them for covert missions over the years, allegedly for patriotic interest. Posing as Leuco, he hired the assassins to kill Weed so he could gather them all in one place and have them kill each other or be killed by the FBI. Baker realises that Weed/Leuco is still alive after Vejar mentions that Hal Leuco is short for Haliaeetus leucocephalus, a Latin phrase that translates into bald eagle, which was part of a playing card set Weed played with in the bunker. Weed/Leuco is shown to be alive and gets into a car. As he drives off, however, he is shot and killed by Baker who then walks away. Lester Tremor and Lazlo Soot are also shown to have escaped the blast and walk away from the scene."

She quickly finds herself being terrorized by all the myths and urban legends that have become part of Chippewa Lake’s 130-year history. While attempting to escape the sights and sounds she is witnessing, Kristy runs into James, whose parents are the caretakers of the park. James listens to Kristy’s plight and journeys with her to investigate these ghosts that have come alive to threaten her. He quickly determines that her frightening accounts are amazingly accurate. However, James discovers that he, too, is now trapped, along with Kristy, inside the park with these demons from the past. Searching futilely for an exit, the pair finds that various attractions—long discarded and fallen into ruin—suddenly come to life, tormenting them at every turn. As Kristy and James make their way through the remains of the park, they encounter a mysterious carny in clown makeup, who once was responsible for operating the amusement park’s roller coaster but who died many years previously. He advises the couple that their only escape to freedom is to relive and survive all the life-threatening tales from the park’s past and to ride the now-operational rides in the park one final time. The couple has no choice but to heed the baffling advice of their inexplicable guide, as he leads them through the park from one horror to another, so they might win their freedom. The looming question remains: will Kristy and James survive the deadly, mythical and mystical apparitions of this desolate and ruinous amusement park or simply become just one more urban legend of the infamous park?

However, he managed to withhold the vital information sought by his captors, particularly their leader, a never-seen Nazi with a limp. His lifelong friend, Louie Lepetino, arranged his escape. When Louie, a New York police lieutenant, dies under suspicious circumstances, Kit ends his convalescence in Arizona and returns to the city to investigate. At the end of the trip, he bumps into attractive fellow passenger Toni Donne . When Kit goes to the police to find out what they know, Inspector Tobin  tells him it was suicide, but Kit knows better. After arranging to stay in the apartment of another friend, Ab Parker , he begins to make the acquaintance of the various guests at the party in which Louie made his fatal plunge. Among them are noted Norwegian historian and wheelchair-using refugee Dr. Christian Skaas , his nephew Otto , Kit's old flame Barby Taviton , who hosted the ill-fated party, and Toni Donne. Also present were singer Whitney Parker , who is Ab's cousin, and her piano-playing accompanist Anton . Kit is shaken when Dr. Skaas discusses the superiority of modern methods of torture over those of the past; it jibes too closely with what he endured. Kit does not know whom to trust, but is attracted to Toni, and she to him. However, it turns out that Toni was the only witness to Louie's fall, raising Kit's suspicions. Meanwhile, Kit repeatedly hears, or imagines he hears, the man with the limp, showing that he may not be fully recovered from his ordeal. Later, when Kit returns to the apartment, he is attacked in the darkness. He manages to gain the upper hand. When he turns on the light, he discovers his assailant is Anton. Anton reveals that Kit was allowed to escape from Spain, and that he has been watched constantly ever since in the hope that he would betray himself. It turns out that Kit's brigade killed a general who was very close to Adolf Hitler. Hitler vowed to get all those responsible and to hang the brigade's battle standard on his wall; Kit knows where the flag is hidden. The next morning, Kit is awoken by a shot; he finds Ab dead in the next room with a bullet through the head. Again, Inspector Tobin insists it must have been suicide. However, Kit knows that Ab was terrified of guns as a result of a childhood incident. Kit publicly gives Toni a medallion  he has had mounted in a necklace, a declaration for all to see that he knows where the flag is. Toni begs him to give up what she considers to be just a ""dirty rag"", but Kit is determined to foil the ""little man"" in Berlin. In the end, Kit insists she choose between him and the enemy; she agrees to help him get into Dr. Skaas's office during another party. Before though, he has to drink a toast with Skaas. As he had before when drinking with the doctor, Kit switches his goblet with Skaas's, an ""old Borgia custom"". However, Skaas has outwitted him, having prearranged for Toni to drug his own drink. While Kit is searching the office, he hears once again the man with a limp. The door opens, and Skaas enters, free of his wheelchair and dragging one leg. Skaas reveals that Kit has been drugged, that Otto killed Lepetino  and that he himself murdered Ab. However, before the drug can take full effect, Kit manages to shoot and kill the doctor, and summon the police. Before they arrive, Toni explains that she was forced to betray him because of her young daughter, held hostage. Kit lets her go and arranges to meet her in Chicago. However, when he and Inspector Tobin watch her board an airplane bound for Lisbon, he knows for certain that she has thrown in her lot with the enemy. She is removed from the plane, and Kit takes her seat to fetch the flag."

She falls into a coma and her memory flashes back to eight years earlier, when she was happily married to Jeffrey and had a loving daughter, Aimee. Her perfect life had subsequently fallen into pieces when she suddenly loses her husband and daughter in a fire. Nine months later, she gives birth to a son, Andrew, who turns out to be deaf. Daphne decides to learn sign language and is tutored by Dr. Matthew Dane, an educator for the deaf. Inspired by her loss, she starts writing a novel called Autumn Years. Daphne grows to be an overprotective mother. Unwilling to enroll her son in a New York public school, she enters him in a special boarding school for deaf children, headed by Matthew Dane and located in New Hampshire. Able to focus on her freelance writing career, she makes her literary debut with a bestseller and hires her best friend Barbara as her assistant. She refuses to do any promotion or tours, though, so that she will be free to visit her son at any time. She often visits his school and grows close to its principal. She keeps herself from becoming involved with him, though, feeling that she should remain faithful to Jeffrey. Meanwhile, she learns that the rights of her second novel Apache have been sold and that it will be turned into a movie. She reluctantly heads to Hollywood, where she falls in love with Justin Wakefield, who is starring in the film adaption. After one romantic night, he tells her that he is in love with her. She loves him also, but soon notices that he takes little interest in her home life and is not enthusiastic about meeting Andrew. Nevertheless, she accepts his marriage proposal and considers locating to Los Angeles with her son. Upset over Justin's lifestyle, coming and going when he feels like it and refusing to be a traditional husband, Daphne breaks off the engagement. She returns home to declare her love to Matthew, but sees him with another woman and misinterprets their relationship. The flashbacks end and the movie forwards to the present. Matthew rushes to the hospital to see Daphne, who still is in a coma. As she awakens, he admits that he is in love with her, and they get engaged.

Georgie says Amy can stay at his, in his Mum's old room. In return , Amy cooks his dinner, cuts his hair and redecorates the house. As time goes on, Amy dislikes the way people ""disrespect"" Georgie and offers to cook him low fat meals, but Georgie tells her that Morris takes care of that. It comes to a head when, after coming back from seeing rival manager Morley Raisin  Morrissey tells Georgie that there's going to be a live weigh-off between him and rival 'Big Brian' . But Amy says they should be helping Georgie to lose weight, not gain it and is told it has nothing to do with her by Morrissey. After being given fatty foods by his friends and neighbours to 'bulk' him up ready for the 'weigh off', Georgie comes to believe he is the 'fattest man in Britain'. But during the live weigh-off, Georgie weighs 42 stone while Big Brian weighs 54 stone. After the weigh-off, Georgie tells Amy that without the title of 'Britain's fattest man' he's 'just another fat man'.  ""When I went out I’d always get the same… ‘Michelin Man’ or ‘Mr Wobbly’ or Fuckin’ Fat Twat’. I heard ‘em… And then along came Morris with his enthusiasm and panache. And suddenly people were paying to come and see me, all right, mainly foreigners, but I didn’t have to be ashamed of me size no more – do you see? So that’s why that title is so important to me: The Fattest Man in Britain. Because if I’m not the fattest, Amy, then what am I, eh? Just a fat man, Amy.""  Amy goes into labour and Georgie calls 999 but falls over while trying to get her bag. Whilst on the floor Amy and Georgie sing Moon River in a bid to comfort Amy as he is unable to get up. The next day, still lying on the floor, Janice rings Georgie and tells him that Amy lost the baby and that it was a boy. When Janice goes round to Georgie&#39;s, she is unable to get him up and rings 999. While waiting for the fire brigade, Georgie tells Janice they need to record all the Jeremy Kyle shows so Amy can rest when she gets back, but Janice gives Georgie a letter from Amy. After being helped up by the fire brigade, Georgie reads the letter in which Amy says she won&#39;t be coming back because she can&#39;t bear to watch Georgie eat himself to death and also adds that she had called the baby &#39;Georgie&#39;. Georgie stops eating altogether . He is visited by Father O&#39;Flaherty  who bluntly tells him to lose weight. When Morrissey goes round, Georgie tells him it&#39;s over because he&#39;s not &#39;Britains biggest man&#39; but Morrissey sobs that Georgie has always been &#39;Britain&#39;s fattest man&#39; to him. While looking at the mess in the garden, Georgie gets up and, for the first time in 23 years, leaves the house and starts walking to the hairdressing salon where Amy now works. On the way, Georgie is stared and shouted at. When Amy sees him, they reconcile. The drama ends with Morrissey driving a batch of tourists, saying they are going to see &#39;Britain&#39;s Greatest Weight Loser&#39; and shows a smiling, slim Georgie getting out of a hairdresser&#39;s chair where Amy has cut his hair."

They have several PCs in their flat and do many experiments with programming such as opening/closing the doors or turning on/off the tap water with help of the PC. One cold winter morning Paweł asks his father to give him a physics problem to solve. Krzysztof does so and Paweł solves it very quickly on his computer. Later Paweł becomes depressed at the sight of a stray dead dog and begins to wonder about deeper things in life. When asked about the nature of death, his father gives him a very objective  explanation of death as the ending of all vital functions. A TV crew comes to Paweł's school and makes several shots of Paweł and his schoolmates for their reportage on the poor quality of milk in public schools. Paweł creates a program that allows him to know what his mother is doing , but the computer is unable to answer as to what she dreams. Irene, however, Paweł's aunt, answers easily: she dreams of Paweł. Paweł also believes that his father's computer must know his mother's dreams. Paweł talks with his aunt about what his father said about death; she elaborates on that and talks about the soul and religion. Irene and Krzysztof discuss Paweł's decision to take religious courses at the local church. One day when arriving home, Krzysztof and Paweł notice that Krzysztof's computer turned itself on. Paweł and his father use the computer to calculate if it is possible for him to skate on the ice, to see whether it would hold him. After filling in the data into the computer, the PC says that the expected ice would hold three times Paweł's weight. Krzysztof even goes to the lake and corroborates that the ice is strong enough to hold him. Paweł finds a pair of skates in a drawer meant to be a Christmas gift and wants to try them on the lake not far away from their home. His father gives his permission. The next day, Krzysztof hears firemen's sirens going off and people rushing to the lake. Later the mother of a classmate of Paweł's comes distraught to Krzysztof; the English lesson where Paweł was supposed to be was cancelled due to illness of the teacher and the ice in the lake broke. Krzysztof remains calm at first and refuses to believe that the ice could have broken, since his calculations clearly indicated that the ice would not break. After searching all around the neighbourhood he gets confirmation from one of Paweł's friends that he was skating at the time of the accident.  Irene and Krzysztof are desperate when the rescue services fish several corpses out of the frozen water . Krzysztof returns home to find that his computer has turned on by itself again indicating that it is ready. Krzysztof later enters a provisional church, destroying a small altar to the Black Madonna of Częstochowa, which appears to be crying.Episode info on www.allmovie.comEpisode synopsis on www.rottentomatoes.comEpisode overview on www.imdb.comEpisode synopsis on www.facets.org The film ends as Krzysztof, in tears, sinks to his knees and tries to cross himself with holy water on his forehead, but the water is frozen.

When he threatens to shoot her, she defends herself by killing him with a gunshot. Katie is arrested and admits to her lawyer that she is guilty, although claiming that she still loves her husband. Jack is shocked to find out she was abused and has trouble accepting that she did not turn to him with her problems implying how it could have saved her from the abuse. He tries to discourage her from taking the case to trial, explaining she could be sentenced for life. Katie thinks she stands a chance, though, wanting to show the jury that she was abused. She also starts to realize and is upset that Jack treats Ellen very badly, and confronts him with it . Realizing that it is the truth, he tries to better his life and apologizes to her . Once the trial begins, Katie has trouble proving the intensity of the domestic violence and is harassed by Jimmy's best friend, Wade Blankenship, who wants revenge for the killing. Additionally, the fact that none of the witnesses reported the violence sooner instead of standing by and doing nothing so as to save Katie from Jimmy's wrath starts to work against her . When Katie testifies, she admits she was naive enough to believe if she provided unconditional love to Jimmy that he would eventually stop abusing her, but finally realized that was never going to happen, and that one of them was going to kill the other. She is found not guilty by the jury and even Jimmy's parents, who at first wanted her in prison for the murder, sympathize with her. The film ends with Katie laying a flower at Jimmy's grave, then telling Jamie that they will have a better life.

When Sho arrives at the house on the first day, he sees a cat, Niya, trying to attack something in the bushes but it soon gives up after it is attacked by a crow. Sho then discovers Arrietty, a Borrower, emerging from the bushes and returning to her home through an underground air vent. Later at night, Arrietty's father, Pod, takes Arrietty on her first ""borrowing"" mission above the floorboards to show her how he ""borrows"" sugar and tissue. After obtaining a sugar cube from the kitchen, they walk within a wall to reach a beautifully intricate dollhouse  in Sho's bedroom, to get tissue. However, Arrietty is spotted by Sho while retrieving a piece of tissue from a tissue box and loses the sugar cube. Sho asks her not to leave and although Arrietty hesitates, she still leaves the room with her father. The next day, Sho leaves the dropped sugar cube beside the underground air vent where he first saw Arrietty. Pod warns Arrietty not to take it because their existence must be kept secret from humans, but his daughter nevertheless sneaks out to visit Sho in his bedroom. She drops the sugar cube he left on the floor, letting him know that she is there. Without revealing herself otherwise, she tells Sho to leave her family alone and that they do not need his help. On her return, Arrietty is intercepted by her father. Realizing they have been detected, Pod and his wife Homily decide that they must move out of the house. Sho learns from Sadako that some of his ancestors had seen Borrowers in the house, and had the dollhouse custom-built in the hopes that Borrowers would use it. The Borrowers had not been seen since, however, and the dollhouse stayed in Sho's room. Pod returns injured from a borrowing mission and is helped home by Spiller, a Borrower boy he met on the way. He informs them that there are other places the Borrowers could move to. While Pod is recovering, Sho removes the floorboard concealing the Borrower household and replaces their kitchen with the kitchen from the dollhouse, in hopes the Borrowers would be more accepting of his knowledge of their existence. However, the Borrowers are frightened by this and instead speed up their moving process. After Pod recovers, he goes to explore some of the places Spiller has suggested. Arrietty goes to bid farewell to Sho, but in the course of conversation he suggests to her that the Borrowers are becoming extinct. Realizing that he has upset his small friend, Sho reveals he has had a heart condition since birth and will have an operation in a few days. The operation does not have a good chance of success. He believes that there is nothing he can do about it, saying that eventually every living thing dies. Arrietty convinces Sho that he will fight for the life he has now nevertheless. Meanwhile, Haru notices the floorboards have been disturbed. Sadako is out and Sho is still in the garden speaking with Arrietty. Haru unearths the Borrowers' house and captures Homily. Alerted by her mother's screams, Arrietty leaves Sho in the garden and goes to investigate. Saddened by her departure, Sho returns to his room. Haru locks him in and calls a pest removal company to capture the other Borrowers alive. With the help of Sho, Arrietty rescues Homily. Sadako returns soon after the pest removal company's arrival and sends them away. Haru and Sadako discover that the Borrowers have left, and that Sho has destroyed any trace of their presence. The Borrowers stop for dinner during their move, and Sho's cat, Niya, spots Arrietty. Niya leads Sho to Arrietty. He gives her a sugar cube, and tells her the Borrowers' fight for survival has given him hope to live through the operation. Arrietty gives Sho her hair clip as a token of remembrance and they go their separate ways. Arrietty, Pod, and Homily leave in a teapot with Spiller. Spiller comforts Arrietty by giving her a red berry after she joins him on the teapot's top."

Tim learns it is actually a ""dinner for idiots"" and the award is to the biggest ""loser"". Tim's girlfriend Julie  lands a curator deal for eccentric artist Kieran Vollard . Tim unsuccessfully proposes to her, as he has done several times before. After learning of the cruel nature of the dinner party, Julie becomes upset and asks him not to attend. He agrees. The next day, Tim accidentally hits IRS employee Barry Speck  with his Porsche as Barry attempts to retrieve a dead mouse in the road. While helping Barry pick up his belongings from the street, Tim learns of Barry's hobby of constructing mouse dioramas and realizes Barry is the perfect guest for the company dinner. Julie is upset that Tim intends to attend the dinner, so she walks out on Tim to be alone and accidentally leaves her cell phone behind. Barry shows up at Tim's apartment a day early. He gets on Tim's computer and foolishly gives Tim's home address to Darla , a woman Tim had a one-night stand with before he met Julie. Tim tells him that Darla has been stalking him ever since. Barry  decides to guard Tim's apartment, but mistakes Julie for Darla, sending her away and giving her the mistaken impression that Tim is cheating on her. Having messed up again, Barry decides to help by calling Vollard to locate Julie. Believing they hear Julie in the background, he and Tim sneak into Vollard's home. Kieran, dressed as an animal, is discovered with two women, dressed as birds, in an art ""process."" Returning to Tim's, Barry finds Darla waiting outside, wearing a suspicious overcoat. Underneath is a leather outfit made of tight pants and a corset. She attempts to seduce Tim, who tries to get her to leave. Tim gets a phone call from Julie, but can't answer because Darla snatches his phone and hides it in the front of her thong. Tim locks himself inside his room as he continues to try to get in contact with Julie. Frustrated by his rejection, Darla tries to seduce Barry in order to spite Tim but fails because Barry innocently fails to comprehend all of her sexual innuendos, which finally gets her to leave. Barry finds a message on Julie's cellphone from Vollard, revealing that Julie is leaving for Vollard's ranch. Barry, trying again to make amends, suggests that they go to his IRS office to find records containing Vollard's ranch address. They meet Barry's boss Therman Murch , who displays ""mind control"" power over Barry. He will help only if Barry will say ""You can eat my pudding,"" which Barry refuses to do. So Therman looks up Tim's instead and informs him that he will be audited, and they leave without the address. Outside, the two see Therman kiss a woman Barry reveals is his ex-wife, saying, ""I used to call her pudding."" Tim lets Barry sleep at his place. He finds several pictures  depicting Barry's life, including him walking in on Therman and his wife in bed which is followed by mouse-Barry tearfully eating by himself, causing Tim to feel sorry for Barry. The next morning, Tim arrives at a brunch with Mueller, making an excuse for Julie's absence. Back at the apartment, Barry takes a call from Tim's assistant Susana , who emphasizes the importance of Julie's attendance. So, he crashes the business lunch, bringing Darla, who pretends to be Julie. Tim is goaded by Mueller into proposing to her, which he does just as Julie arrives unexpectedly. After Darla smashes Tim's Porsche, Barry tries again to make amends by giving in to Therman's humiliating demands so that he can get Vollard's address. At the ranch, Vollard is attempting to seduce Julie with his art ""process."" Tim explains recent events to her, but while confiding what a fool Barry is, Barry overhears. Julie tells Tim she is leaving for San Francisco with Vollard. Barry sadly confesses he never knew what his wife thought of him until she left him. Tim apologizes for what has happened, and Barry returns home to his mouse dioramas. After the loss of his ""talented"" guest, Tim arrives at the dinner party armed with excuses. To his surprise, he finds Barry has arrived on his own, and is already impressing Fender and Mueller. Barry's dioramas become a hit at the party, making him a shoo-in for the trophy, but unexpectedly, Therman arrives and embarrasses Barry with his mind control. Tim takes Barry aside, tells him everything and, after some encouragement, entices Barry to overcome Therman with ""brain control"". Upon Barry's reception of the trophy, Tim confronts Fender, saying he has been on the wrong side all along – he stands with the group of ""losers"". As the real purpose of the dinner is revealed, the guests react unhappily and inadvertently cause chaos, resulting in a vulture carrying off Mueller's finger  and the house catching fire. Tim returns home and finds Julie's note that she has gone. Knowing he has lost all but done the right thing, Tim tells Barry how much he loves Julie and how badly he messed things up with her. Barry, seeing Julie has just shown up at the doorway, goads Tim into continuing to describe how he messed up. Barry explains to Vollard  that if he takes Julie it will break Tim's heart and people die of broken hearts; Vollard valiantly steps aside. An epilogue of Barry's dioramas tells how everyone fared in the end: Tim marries Julie and they honeymoon in Paris; Barry enters into a relationship with Darla, does some artwork with Vollard, and hosts a monthly ""breakfast for champions"" for all of the ""losers""; Therman writes a book from a mental hospital; Tim and Julie collaborate on a new museum in Switzerland with Mueller. It is revealed that Fender's company has gone under and Forbes magazine has named him ""Wall Street's Biggest Loser""."

An especially secure carriage is attached to a train  and a unit of American commando troops assigned to travel with him. Three intelligence agents, Alan Cooper, Captain Franchetti and Lt. Lorna Fisher are assigned as bodyguards, but Cooper is held back after he chases and kills a French double agent.

Now revealed, von Tiblis opens fire on the passengers and takes over the engine at gunpoint. The train comes to a halt, and a unit of German paratroopers, awaiting this moment, attack the train. They kill nearly all the American soldiers and wound and kill many passengers. Back in Algiers, Allied intelligence learn of the attempted kidnap and Cooper volunteers for a dangerous mission.

Those countries lived through the conflict spanning from 1963 to 1974, a conflict between the PAIGC  and Portuguese troops. In 1995, Diana Andringa, the director of the film, visited the town of Geba as a reporter and there she found a stone half-destroyed in the name of the Portuguese soldiers killed on African soil. This was the starting point for this work. Along with Flora Gomes, the second director, the two directors produced a documentary which is the result of two points of view of Portugal and Guiné, about one of the bloodiest conflicts suffered during the Portuguese Colonial War. For six weeks, Diana Andringa and Flora Gomes traveled through the regions of Mansoa, Geba, and guilegar in Guinea-Bissau,Cape Verde and Portugal where they collected the testimonies of people who lived through the colonial war. Throughout the documentary we see the homage to Amilcar Cabral, founder of the PAIGC. The testimonies show the magnitude of Cabral who, despite being in the middle of the conflict between the two countries, has never ceased to feel to the Portuguese people as something of their own. According to Amilcar, there existed between the two sides a complicity that went beyond the war. ""We're not fighting against the Portuguese people, but against colonialism,"" words that show how many of the Portuguese colonies were joined in solidarity with revolutionary movements for independence. It was the case of PAIGC in Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde, the MPLA  in the case of Angola and FRELIMO  in the case of Mozambique. Therefore, it is no accident that it was in Guinea where the captains' movement  grew, leading to the Carnation Revolution of April 25th 1974. The war resulted in two victories: the independence of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde and democracy in Portugal. It is this ""paired adventure"" that Andringa and Flora want to tell through the voices of those who lived through the conflict. Diana Andringa and Flora Gomes are the narrators of the documentary. The soundtrack is made up of music from Portuguese, Guinea and Cape Verde from the featured period."

Shortly after the ceremony, Chris' 17-year-old cousin Dana  warns Jennifer that she will not be happy with him, but Jennifer sees no harm in it. Because Chris has recently joined the Navy, Jennifer agrees to move with him to the seaside, where she befriends Nancy Halloran . Shortly after, Gina Corbet , a neighbor, becomes the victim of a peeping tom and is later raped by a masked man. Most women of the neighborhood leave in panic, but Chris dismisses the danger and convinces Jennifer that they are overreacting. Meanwhile, Chris' dark side is starting to emerge and he becomes more violent and possessive. Jennifer finds out that Chris has been released from his Navy duty by threatening to kill himself if he had to go to sea. When she tells him about this, he responds aggressively, accusing her of being a spy. The same night, he is arrested for voyeurism. Chris pleads guilty to the charges, and agrees to a disposal from the Navy. Jennifer is devastated by this news, considering that she has recently found out that she is pregnant. Regardless, she gives him another chance, and upon moving back to their previous home, things take a turn for the better. However after a while, Chris' temper returns and women in the neighborhood are again being tortured by a masked rapist. Following the birth of Jennifer's daughter, Dana tells Jennifer that she was molested by Chris as a child. Jennifer starts to suspect his involvement in the string of rapes. After talking to a Detective from California, who tells her that he had all the evidence but could not do anything because Chris was under the protection of a district attorney friend , Jennifer decides that it is time to leave her husband. Chris, however, is unwilling to let her go, and he turns to domestic violence. Jennifer is rescued by two police officers, and afterwards presses charges against her husband. She drops them only a few days later, when Chris convinces her that he will not be convicted and threatens to harm her and their baby if she runs away. While posing as his loving wife, she tries to collect evidence against him. She finds his weapons in his car, but by the time the police arrive, they have disappeared. After this occurrence, Chris' threats increase. One night, she follows him when he suddenly leaves at a late hour. She catches him putting on his rape clothes and warns the police. Chris tries to get away, but is eventually arrested. In the epilogue titles, it is revealed that Chris pleaded guilty to four counts of aggravated sexual assault and one count of sexual attempted assault. He was sentenced to a term of 99 years.

On the other side of the world Col. Jim Faith  and Lt. Dixon Piper  are searching for former Green Beret, Navy SEAL and Army Ranger MacGruber in Ecuador. The two men find MacGruber  meditating in a chapel, and try to convince him to return to the United States in an effort to retrieve the warhead. MacGruber refuses; later that night, MacGruber explodes into a fit of rage after a flashback where Cunth killed his fiancé, Casey Fitzpatrick , at their wedding; he then accepts the Colonel's offer. After arriving at The Pentagon and having a heated conversation with Faith and Piper, MacGruber decides he will form his own team to pursue Cunth, declining the offer to build a team around Piper. MacGruber successfully recruits all but his long-time friend Vicki St. Elmo  and Brick Hughes ([[Big Show  - MacGruber initially recruits Hughes, but upon discovering he is gay, crosses his name off his list. MacGruber and his team meet Faith and Piper on a tarmac. Upon being asked where his team is, MacGruber responds that they are in the van along with his homemade C-4 explosives. The van promptly explodes, killing the team. MacGruber is distraught over the loss of the team and is promptly removed from the Cunth case. In a one-on-one conversation with Piper, MacGruber convinces him to form a new team. Vicki also arrives, completing MacGruber's team. The group travels to Cunth's nightclub in Las Vegas. MacGruber gets on stage and announces who he is, his intentions, and where he will be the next day. The team sets up a sting operation with Vicki portraying MacGruber. Hoss Bender , one of Cunth's henchmen, attacks the van MacGruber and Piper are in. MacGruber tells Piper to pass him an Incredi-Mop, which he uses to turn the ignition key and hit the gas pedal, running down Bender. With Vicki disguised as Bender and Piper disguised as MacGruber, the team breaks into a warehouse to stop von Cunth from getting the passcodes to operate the rocket. MacGruber distracts the guards by walking around naked with a piece of celery clenched between his buttocks. Piper manages to kill most of the men inside, but is unable to stop the transfer of the pass codes. MacGruber and the team go to a charity event Cunth is holding. After a heated conversation, Cunth's guards throw MacGruber out. After the fiasco, MacGruber returns to the Pentagon where Faith reprimands him. MacGruber and Piper relax and drink after being taken off the case. Soldiers attack but MacGruber uses Piper as a human shield to survive; Vicki and MacGruber escape. Piper survives due to the fact that he was wearing a bulletproof vest, but leaves, disgusted that MacGruber used him as protection. Vicki and MacGruber return to Vicki's house where the two have sex. MacGruber goes to his wife's grave in shame, feeling that he has betrayed her memory, but her ghost gives her blessing to allow MacGruber to pursue Vicki. MacGruber then has sex with the ghost of his wife on her tombstone. Upon returning to Vicki's house, MacGruber discovers that Cunth kidnapped her, and realizes what Cunth's plan is: to bomb the State of the Union address. Cunth calls MacGruber to gloat, but MacGruber traces the call. MacGruber meets up with Piper to save Vicki. The two men make their way into Cunth's compound, in large part due to MacGruber's propensity for ripping throats. Soldiers capture MacGruber and Piper and bring them to Vicki and the missile. The group manages to overpower Cunth and his men and MacGruber handcuffs Cunth to a handrail. MacGruber removes the nuclear component and guidance system before his team escapes as the missile explodes. Six months later, MacGruber and Vicki are getting married. Also present at the wedding as ghosts are his dead team members Vernon Freedom , Tug Phelps , Tut Beemer , and Tanker Lutz ([[Kane . Out of the corner of his eye, MacGruber spots a disfigured Cunth, thought dead, with an RPG. MacGruber saves Vicki, and battles Cunth before throwing him off a cliff behind the altar, shooting him with a machine gun and launching a grenade as he falls, incinerating the corpse, and finally urinating on it at the foot of the cliff. The end credits show MacGruber and Vicki's wedding party, where they eventually have sex on the dance floor. After the credits, MacGruber sits in a tree, playing a saxophone.

He plans on visiting his niece Jennifer in Chicago for the holidays. Jennifer is a successful businesswoman and the single mother of her young son Brian. She grew up all her life mostly at Ralph's, as her mother was constantly traveling and her father died when she was very young. Since then, she has lost her Christmas spirit. At the airport, Ralph has no idea where he has to be and he is helped by co-traveller Morgan Derby, a 30-year-old chef who has trouble accepting his age. When it turns out his second flight to Denver is cancelled, Ralph offers Morgan to stay at Jennifer's place. Initially, Jennifer is reluctant to take in Morgan, but she allows him to stay, since he is a top chef and she needs someone to make her son a turkey. They soon come to the conclusion that they are two completely different people. Jennifer is irritated by his careless and adventurous behavior and Morgan feels that she is a cynical control freak, which is mostly the result of dating the successful but materialistic businessman Richard Windom. Ralph, however, feels that they are perfect for each other and tries to prevent Jennifer from sending Morgan away. When Jennifer is about to set him off at the airport, it turns out Ralph has stolen his passport. Jennifer and Morgan end up spending the entire day together and bond. With a lot of trouble and some illegal activities, Morgan is able to get Brian the one Christmas gift he wished for: rocketwheel, a very rare bicycle. Later that night, on Christmas Eve, Morgan makes Brian believe in Santa Claus again, by climbing on the roof and pretending to be one of Santa's helpers. Meanwhile, Jen and Richard attend a formal party and get engaged. Upon hearing the news, Morgan feels disappointed and leaves. Jennifer is mad when she finds out, but softens up when Ralph tells her that Morgan nearly killed himself on the roof, trying to make Brian believe in Christmas again. Finally convinced by Ralph and Morgan's opinion on Richard and realizing she is in love with Morgan, she breaks off the engagement. She rushes to the airport, trying to stop Morgan from leaving. In the end, they become a couple.

Unable to escape the thought that her parents could have kidnapped her, Jenny/Janie first writes a letter to the Sands, but is unable to send it. Jenny/Janie and her friend Reeve , track down the Sands family and realize she must be the missing Jennifer as she has exactly the same red hair as every member of their family. Unable to keep the secret from her parents any longer as she lost the letter and thought someone might have sent it, Jenny/Janie tells her them what she's learned, showing them the milk carton. Jenny/Janie's parents believe that Hannah may have kidnapped Jenny/Janie and posed her as her own child. Jenny/Janie is quickly reunited with her biological parents, Jonathan and Sada Sands , and her older brother Stephen and younger sister Jodie. Though her parents and sister are happy, neither Jenny/Janie nor Stephen are exactly thrilled. Unable to enjoy being a part of the family and despising being called ""Jenny"", both Jenny/Janie and Sada both come to realize she stopped being Jenny when she lived with the Jessmons and has to be returned to where she really belongs. When Jenny/Janie decides to run away back to the Jessmons, Stephen tracks her down at a bus station and tells her why he'd been so hostile towards her: when they were little, they had been at a shoe store with their mother and Jodie, and Stephen was supposed to watch her and hold her hand, but he didn't, which is why Hannah  had taken her. Jenny/Janie says she forgives him and they make peace. Her father Jonathan, though sad, accepts this while Jodie and Stephen don't. However, Jenny/Janie tells Jodie they are still and always will be sisters, and Stephen apologizes again for having let go of her hand. As Sada and Jenny/Janie are driving back to the Jessmons', she tells her about the day at the shoe store, and Jenny/Janie says she's sorry she was bad and that she shouldn't have gone with Hannah, but Sada tells her that this was not her fault. As Jenny/Janie leaves with her adoptive father into their house, Sada comes face to face with her daughter's adoptive mother Miranda, who extends her hand to her. Sada says, ""Take care of our daughter"", and Miranda responds, ""I know how you are feeling"", to which Sada tells her, ""You're the only other one who would."""

Tragically, his wife Gretchen  was shot by someone unknown to her while leaving work. Casey and Jason Hest  offer condolences and reach out to Brent repeatedly. At first he rejects it, but when Casey sends over one of her famous dishes, Brent opens up. It starts off as a friendship, but it becomes obvious that Brent has a crush on the struggling writer. When Casey and Jason decide to remodel their kitchen, Brent quickly offers his services. Through a series of flashbacks we see that things were not going well between Brent and Gretchen. Brent disapproved of her new career as in advertisement, believing she had sold out as an artist. He blamed Jason for introducing Gretchen to Sean . Brent grew increasing convinced that Sean and his wife were having an affair. We learn that Gretchen's untimely death was the work of a junkie, hired by Brent to kill her. As if that wasn't evil enough, instead of paying the killer off, Brent poisoned him with some liquor. While measuring for blueprints for the remodeling job, he goes through the neighbors' belongings. Finding Casey's lingerie, he begins to fantisize about being together with her. He imagines running over Jason, paying him back for ruining his marriage. Through a series of hidden cameras Brent learns that Casey is jealous and suspicious of Jason's medical partner Paula, and also that Jason previously had an affair. Brent uses this, and other bits of information, to turn Casey against her husband. When Jason is unable to show up at his son's soccer game, Casey's car mysteriously refuses to start. Conveniently, Brent offers to take Austin to his game, while she waits for help. She eventually arrives at the game, thanking him for his help. She quips that she ""owes him"", and he affirms that he will collect. As Brent's assistant was going through his books, she notices a charge for gas on his credit card bill. It concerns her that is in the neighborhood where the junkie met his demise, so she alerts the police. The cops go through Brent's background to discover that Gretchen wasn't his first wife, that he was previously married, and he's a ""classic abuser"". Within eight months of their marriage, she had filed a restraining order. He is now a person of interest in Gretchen's death. Soon Brent causes trouble for Jason, stealing confidential information on the mayor's health, making Jason miss Casey's book reading by sabotaging Paula's heat and lights so she'd have to check on her mother, while Jason had to take Paula's patients, then when Jason asked for advice on should he cancel going to a benefit given for Paula, Brent tells him to go but not tell Casey. Brent hides out in his car taking pictures that seem like an intimate moment between Paula and Jason and send them to Casey's cell phone. When Jason comes home, an obviously drunk Casey confronts him and kicks him out. Brent sees this as an opportunity to move in; he makes a move and kisses Casey, who at first didn't stop him, but then asked him to leave. The next day when he went over, she told him he's still grieving and it was a mistake; he doesn't take it well, stating he know she has feelings for him, and that Jason will just hurt her again, noting about Jason's previous affair, she asks how he knows this and says that he and Jason had drinks earlier. Casey calls Jason to have him come over and asks him if he told Brent about the affair; Jason told her, he didn't. She tells him about the kiss and that he started acting weird, while Brent is listening in on the hidden cameras, Casey tells Jason she doesn't have feelings for Brent, which upsets him, he says, ""tell him you do love me"". Jason says that Brent must have been spying on them, he searches around and discovers the hidden cameras, they decide to call the police and leave the house, Brent loses it, the lights turn off and he knocks out Jason who was trying to call the police on his cell phone. Brent tells him, ""you destroyed my life, you're going to lose everything, your wife, your child and your home. then we'll be even."" He hits him in the head again. Casey calls for Jason but Brent answers; she locks herself and Austin in his room, she has him climb out the window to the neighbors, Brent breaks down the door, she grabs a small vase and hides it. Brent told her that Jason ruined his life, that he had to kill Gretchen so she wouldn't leave him for Sean, and that he never expected to fall in love with her, but ever since the first day she came over to comfort him. But he tells her she just like Gretchen, she hits him in the head and runs to the kitchen to find Jason, she grabs a knife calling out for Jason, she hears a noise and accidentally stabs Jason. Brent runs down with a knife holding it to her throat, saying they could have had everything, she's the perfect wife, mother and companion, but not now. She grabs a knife and stabs him.

Dharamdas had struck a business deal with Dhanraj. Here, Asha marries her love interest Akash, but he dies in an air crash. Asha grieves his loss, following which Dharamdas cancels his plan to sell the factory and decides to dedicate the factory as a souvenir to Akash. Dhanraj doesn't want this deal be cancelled and hence bribes Dharamdas's trusted employees Manmohan Saxena, Ashok Gupta, and Rita into helping him to kill Dharamdas. Dharamdas has to go to Nainital for a business trip. However, he is approached by Dhanraj, Ashok, and Manmohan in the train itself and is forced to sign an agreement that would entitle Dhanraj to be the sole owner of all his riches. Dharamdas does as told, however the crooks kill him and bury him nearby. During the fracas, Ashok's knife falls down into the grave but he is in a hurry and doesn't have time to take it out. In the meantime, Asha and Kaajal are being looked after by Ajit Roy, who used to hold a responsible post in the factory during Dharamdas's ownership. Ajit Roy strikes up another deal with Dhanraj. Suddenly, the ""ghost"" of Dharamdas starts confronting his killers. The villains die due to the shock of seeing him. A wave of panic runs among the killers. Dharamdas's daughters are unaware of the truth, as they believe that their father has gone missing. Dharamdas's case is given to Inspector Anand, an old friend of Akash. When the villains start dying mysteriously, Anand becomes confident that there is some connection between the deaths and the disappearance of Dharamdas. Anand sets up traps, confident that Dharamdas is still alive and killing his associates for some still unknown reason. He has no luck until Dhanraj gets killed. Anand sees Dharamdas and shoots him. After giving him a chase, it is revealed to him and Kaajal that the ""ghost"" was none other than Asha wearing the mask of her father. Nobody is sure why Asha did this, but she drops a bombshell by telling the court that her father is dead and that she has killed his killers. Asha explains that she was supposed to travel somewhere too on the fateful day. But she suddenly developed fever, upon which Dharamdas decided to take her with him. Asha saw the killers kill her father and throw away his body in front of her own eyes. Asha survived because nobody knew that she was travelling with Dharamdas. She was in the bathroom, unknown to the killers, in a state of shock. However, the court holds her guilty of murdering Dhanraj. It is claimed that Dhanraj knew the truth, which is why he was shot dead by her. Asha claims that she never attacked him. Anand decides to investigate the matter again. He realizes that Ajit knows more about the matter than he is letting in. He finds out Ajit's secret lair alongwith Kaajal. Going through the documents there, he receives another shocker: Akash is still alive. Anand succeeds in locating his friend. Akash tells him that Ajit had him kidnapped and faked the accident to usurp Dharamdas's wealth. The duo escape the place after overpowering Ajit's goons. Finally, they confront Ajit who accepts that he killed Dhanraj. Ajit was afraid that Dhanraj might rat him out due to the panic. So, when ""Dharamdas"" made his appearance in front of Dhanraj, Ajit used the chance. Based on Ajit's confession, Asha is exonerated and gets a lower sentence.

In reality, Thorens is a white slaver who plans to send Lisa to South America. Unbeknownst to both Lisa and Thorens, they are being trailed by Dutch Inspectors Peter Jongman and Sergeant Wolters. Jongman carries with him the guilt of not having saved his Jewish fiancée from death at the hands of the Nazis during the war. Jongman follows Lisa and Thorens to London, where Jongman meets with Thorens to discuss Lisa’s situation. During their encounter, Jongman strikes Thorens, who accidentally falls into an SS dagger and dies. Jongman leaves, unaware of Thorens’ death, and thinks Thorens has only passed out from the blow. Upon returning to Amsterdam with Lisa, Jongman visits his mother and sister. Jongman’s mother initially believes Lisa is taking advantage of her son, until Lisa reveals she was experimented with while at the medical research block in Auschwitz. Later, Jongman visits Dutch police headquarters, and is confronted by his superiors about Thorens’ death. Jongman explains to his chief and to Wolters that he only struck Thorens but did not kill him. Not knowing the truth about Thorens’ death, Jongman suspects Lisa killed Thorens instead. Jongman takes time off, and decides to help Lisa reach Palestine, probably to make amends for his inability to save his Jewish girlfriend. Through his contacts in shipping circles, Jongman finds work on a Dutch barge owned by Captain Brandt for him and Lisa. While traveling in the barge, Lisa and Jongman begin to fall in love, while slowly gaining the acceptance of the crusty but goodhearted Brandt. Eventually, Lisa and Jongman make their way to Tangiers, where they meet a colorful Dutch smuggler named Klaus Van der Pink. Jongman attempts to strike a deal with Van der Pink, but his price to arrange passage to Palestine is too high. Jongman then seeks help from American Browne, who agrees to help them get to Palestine. During a required medical examination for Lisa before her trip, Jongman discovers that the Nazis had experimented with Lisa while at Auschwitz. Jongman reaffirms his growing love for Lisa. Lisa rejects Jongman, however, because she feels incapable of being a wife or a mother due to her Auschwitz ordeal, despite the doctor’s belief that her damage is more psychological than physical. Jongman also finds out from a British agent named Roger Dickens, that he is wanted back in London for questioning about Thorens’ death. Due to her Auschwitz experience, both the British and American authorities in Tangiers exert pressure on Lisa not to go to Palestine, and to consider testifying at the Nuremberg War Trials instead. Lisa agrees to testify but changes her mind while at the airport, and continues with her plans to go with Jongman to Palestine. Knowing that the British are planning to block any attempt by Lisa to enter Palestine, Jongman makes a deal with Dickens. In return for allowing Lisa to enter Palestine, Jongman offers to surrender to the British police after Lisa safely arrives in Palestine. Jongman also arranges passage to Palestine for Lisa and himself in one of Van der Pink smuggling vessels, in exchange for signing a contract to work for Van der Pink for a year without pay. Once Jongman safely delivers Lisa into the hands of the Haganah in Palestine, Jongman leaves Lisa behind in order to keep his deal with the British authorities.

By arbitrary application of this policy via unchecked authority, soon nail clippers, key chains, and aspirin were considered dangerous and violations of the rules. This policy, combined with Columbine-inspired fear, has resulted in kindergartners being suspended for using pointed fingers as guns in games of cops and robbers and students being suspended for having Midol and Alka-Seltzer. This policy has turned schools into Kafka-esque nightmares, absurd and demoralizing. Increasingly, issues once dealt with by the guidance counselor or a trip to the principal’s office are now handled by handcuffs and tasers in the hands of police.http://www.nhpr.org/node/29048{{dead link|date""huffingtonpost1"">{{cite news|urlJonathan Kim: ReThink Interview: Cevin Soling, Director of the War On Kids |publisher 2010-03-29|accessdate""huffingtonpost1""/> Ritalin and other drugs are being over-prescribed. These strong drugs can have dire consequences, including suicide and murder. Some school shooters, including the Columbine killers, have used or been on these drugs. This film touches on an area almost completely ignored in any discussion of education - the genesis of compulsory education. Public schools are modeled after a Prussian system, one geared towards creating compliant soldiers.{{cite news|urlJonathan Kim: ReThink Review: The War On Kids - Education's Prisoners |publisher 2010-01-14|accessdate""cvillepodcast1"">{{cite web|urlCharlottesville-Right Now: Cevin Soling » Charlottesville Podcasting Network |publisher2012-02-26 |accessdate""cvillepodcast1""/>"

Nick, not wanting to arrive at their father's birthday dinner after them is driving erratically and fast, but when he takes a shortcut to a back road through some woodlands. Several miles in, the tire gets a flat and they are unable to get cell phone signals to call for help. While repairing the car, Sam confronts Nick about how he thinks Nick is wasting his life being a musician, his latest fling with Christine being another mistake on his judgement list. As they are arguing, they are approached by a grizzly bear. Despite efforts of Nick to convince the group to calmly leave, Sam takes matters into his own hands and shoots the bear down with a handgun. After the bear dies, they are approached by a larger male bear who charges them in revenge, causing them to retreat into their car. In his rage, the bear overturns the car, trapping the humans inside. After striding around for several minutes, the bear leaves, allowing the crew to turn the car back over. But as they start driving, the axles break under both sets of tires, stranding them again. The group tries to leave on foot, but they are ambushed by the bear who chases them to an out-of-ground pipe. He tricks them into leaving for the car again and attacks again; this time he is able to catch Christine who is killed then dragged away while the others watch. Nick begins to think that the bear is taking out his revenge on them one-by-one due to a native American legend that bears are actually the reincarnated spirits of shaman and are capable of human thoughts and emotion. Sam dismisses this and they set a trap to try to keep the bear in the car in order for them to escape. The trap is sprung, but Nick is nearly killed by the bear, forcing Sam and Liz to release the bear and retreat back into the vehicle themselves. Sam opts as a marathon runner to jog the several miles to the restaurant, but when he arrives he is attacked before he can get help by the bear who followed him. Meanwhile, Liz tells Nick that she and Sam have been having serious financial troubles which has caused a rift in their marriage putting him into extraordinary debt and possibly under scrutiny for embezzlement from Sam's company, which is the reason he gave their father a Porsche . Sam is returned rather violently by the bear and released to climb into the car. Nick surmises there must be a reason Sam had been returned, and Liz reveals to him that she's pregnant. But it was established earlier that due to the rift in their marriage, they hadn't slept together in about six months while she is two months pregnant. Nick realizes that he is the father, due to an affair he and Liz had months prior which breaks Sam's heart and Nick realizes the true reason the bear had locked all three of them together; Sam, realizing that Liz might be happier with Nick offers to sacrifice himself and attack the bear so the other two can escape, as he is dying, Nick rushes to help and is killed as well. The bear approaches Liz, who sinks to her knees as the bear sniffs her, closing her eyes ready to die. But the attack never comes, and the bear instead leaves her alone, likely having sensed her pregnancy. As she begins down the road by herself, the camera turns to the bodies of Sam and Nick lying next to each other and the screen goes black.

In Moose Lake, Minnesota, a crate with a male blue macaw hatchling falls out of a truck and is found by Linda Gunderson, who names him Blu. Fifteen years later, Blu is unable to fly and is ridiculed by the Canada Geese that come by the outside of Linda's bookstore. One day, ornithologist Túlio Monteiro invites Blu and Linda to Rio de Janeiro on the condition that Blu, who is the last male of his species, mates with a female macaw. Linda accepts and they fly to Rio, where Blu meets a Red-crested Cardinal named Pedro and his Yellow Canary friend Nico. At Túlio's aviary, Blu falls in love with Jewel, a fiercely independent blue macaw longing to flee into the wilderness. The macaws are captured by Fernando, an impoverished orphan boy, and a Sulphur-crested Cockatoo named Nigel, both of whom work for a group of smugglers led by Marcel. Nigel tells the macaws that he vowed to smuggle exotic birds after his role had been replaced on a television program. Blu and Jewel are able to escape and flee into a jungle. Fernando meets Linda and Túlio and tells them that Marcel forced him to capture birds, before cooperating with the two to find Blu. Meanwhile, Blu and Jewel meet a Toco toucan named Rafael, who offers to take them to his bulldog friend Luiz to remove their leg chain. He tries to teach Blu how to fly, before they meet up with Pedro and Nico. Nigel hires a horde of thieving marmosets to capture Blu and Jewel. Pedro and Nico take Blu and Jewel to a bird's Rio-style party, where they perform a duet, but are encountered by the marmosets. Their bird friends fight them while Blu's group escapes. Fernando takes Linda and Túlio to the smugglers hideout, where they discover that Blu has escaped. Marcel explains that he will use the Rio Carnival parade to capture Blu and Jewel. Meanwhile, Blu and the others meet Luiz, who releases the chain holding Blu and Jewel; and the macaws decide to go their separate ways after a heated argument. When Blu and Rafael learn from Pedro and Nico that Nigel captured Jewel, they rush to the carnival to rescue her, while Linda and Túlio organize a rescue attempt for the birds. As Linda and Túlio pose as dancers in blue macaw costumes, Marcel uses Nigel to capture the birds. On board Marcel's Short SC.7 Skyvan, the macaws release the captive birds, but Nigel injures Jewel. Blu fights with Nigel, and the smugglers flee the plane. Unable to fly, Jewel falls out of the plane towards the ocean. Jumping out of the plane to rescue Jewel, Blu finally discovers that he is able to fly.

They look at a drawing of a deceased man, Charles Reamer, and with all of them concentrating at the same time, they hope to be able to summon his spirit into the room. Years later, four college students, Patrick , Lydia , Greg , and Ben  attempt to recreate the Charles Experiment on a larger scale by using modern technology to amplify their concentration over 400 times the original. During the experiment, something attacks the students and pulls Lydia into the wall. The movie switches to Ben's girlfriend Kelly  who lives in a nearly empty subdivision along with their neighbors Mike , his young daughter Maggie  and their dog Pepper. One evening, Ben and Kelly discover strange burn marks on their counters. They lock the doors, but Kelly awakens in the middle of the night to find both doors wide open. They decide to change the locks and install surveillance cameras. Later, Kelly finds that Pepper has wandered into her house. As she follows him, he walks into the laundry room and collapses. The dog is taken to the vet, where it dies. Returning home, Kelly notices the floor in the laundry room has begun peeling. She removes some of the linoleum and finds a large amount of mold and spores, Ben finds even more in a crawlspace. Later, Ben finds 36 ""Urgent"" emails from Patrick in his inbox that first invite him to a new attempt at the Charles Experiment, followed by a warning that ""containment failed"" and finally ""you are in danger"". Attachments to the emails include footage of the new experiment, this time amplifying their signal to that of 4000 people. Kelly calls for Ben and shows him her closet, in which all of the clothes have been trashed. They begin to hear noises throughout the house. Ben talks Kelly into camping in the yard and agrees to keep watch overnight. During the night, Ben leaves his watch post in the tent to investigate a noise. While he is gone, three of the camera feeds to the surveillance monitor go blank. The last remaining camera falls to the ground and begins to move towards the sleeping Kelly. The next day, while Kelly is gone, Ben finds another large chunk of mold growing. He prods at it with a broom, causing it to break open and reveal a figurine inside that had been used during the previous experiment. Later, Kelly discovers Ben's equipment from the experiment, including a recording of Lydia's disappearance. She confronts Ben, who admits to taking part in it and apologizes for not telling her sooner. After witnessing another appearance by the apparition, they decide to stay at a hotel, but they're attacked there as well and flee. While on the run, they receive a call from Patrick and agree to meet with him. Once together, Patrick explains that the initial experiment enabled a malevolent spirit entity to enter their world and further attempts to contain it have failed. Patrick also mentions he has built a room surrounded by a negative current that he believes protects him from the spirit. They return to Kelly and Ben's house to try a new experiment to contain the entity, this time using the city's power to simulate the power of 400,000 people. While setting up, Kelly becomes trapped in the laundry room with the spirit, but it disappears. During the experiment, the house begins to shake and break apart, then abrutply stops. While Kelly and Ben are cleaning out the house, Patrick is pulled into darkness and vanishes. They return to find his chair empty and various objects merged with parts of the house. Unable to find Patrick, the two leave for the safety chamber in Patrick's house. Inside Patrick's house, Ben and Kelly hear Patrick's personal log being played back, including information about the members of the original experiment. Of the original six, two died, one committed suicide and the other three simply disappeared. After entering and closing the cage, the lights go out, and when they come back Ben has disappeared. Kelly exits the chamber and finds Ben's contorted corpse beyond the door. She leaves the house and sees her truck being absorbed into the ground as well. As Kelly wanders aimlessly, Patrick's narration explains that the first experiment made the group a beacon for the entity, while the second one helped it cross into their world. He further explains that it gets stronger with each person it claims, and that it will wear its victims down until they're too weak to resist. As day breaks, Kelly's wandering leads to a Costco. Inside, she walks to the camping section, enters a tent, zips the door closed, and waits. Having given up resisting, a number of hands appear from behind and slowly grab hold of her as the movie cuts to black."

He sends false notices from the post office to her, calling her to pick up money which does not exist, just to see her. In the evenings, he spies on her through a telescope, as she lives in an apartment opposite his, and calls her frequently. Magda sees many men in her apartment and Tomek manages to ruin her dates by calling the gas service to check a leak. Tomek wants to see Magda, so he takes an extra job delivering milk in the mornings. Magda goes to the post office to collect a new note that Tomek sent her and is accused by the office manager of trying to rob the office by presenting false notes. Magda storms out of the post office; Tomek follows her and confesses to his peeping. She initially does not believe him, but when he says that she was weeping last night she becomes angry, because it was true. That night Magda spots Tomek peeping again and makes signs that he should call her. He does so and she tells him to watch closely. She receives her current lover and, just as they are about to begin having sex, she stops and tells him of the peeping going on.

After Scott discovers that one of the men he sent to his death is innocent, he falls into a drunken haze, is arrested for drunk and disorderly conduct, and determines to defend one of his fellow incarcerated.

In the process Scott ends up defending an associate of the city's crime boss, a man he refused to work for earlier in the film due to the fact that “...no one would testify against you; you own the people who work for you”.

Over the course of the film Ellen Miles' kills her husband in self defense and Scott determines to defend her as there are no witnesses. There is a sub-plot here involving Ellen Miles husband, the crime boss, and an ongoing leak between the D.A.s office and the crime boss. The leak turns out to be Ellen's husband, Ray Borden. The new D.A., not knowing this, determines that Ellen herself is the leak and that she has murdered her husband when found out.

On the one hand, she sympathizes with Patti, a mentally unstable alcoholic who depends on witnesses, and she wants the rapists to be punished.

She does visit Patti, though, who does not remember the rape completely. Anna admits to her about the rape, after which Patti presses charges. Kevin and Anna avoid being summoned to testify, which puts a great deal of feeling guilt on Anna's shoulders. She knows that Patti, because of her alcoholic background, can rely only on Anna.

Masterda , who is a well-known revolutionary leader of the Indian Republican Army Chittagong, who had an instinctual flair for Swaraj and Independence. The film opens up with 16 teenagers playing football in an open field, when the army convoy steps up and orders them to evacuate the field for setting up a base there. When the children oppose their unauthorized evacuation, the soldiers threaten them and then leave, grinning and planning to meet Masterda Surya Sen. Surya Sen is a village school teacher and an activist for Indian freedom and has links with many other famous revolutionaries who adore him as their leader. The revolutionaries were Ganesh Ghosh , Lokenath Bal, Ambika Chakraborty, Nirmal Sen and Ananta Singh. Nirmal Sen  after being released from jail meets Masterda and asks him for next action. Masterda assures him of next action soon and Nirmal goes on to meet Pritilata Waddedar , when she expresses her eagerness to join the Indian Republican Army along with her friend Kalpana Datta . Together they meet Masterda who asks them to prove their skills by assigning them the task of collecting information about the Cantonment. Dressed as sweeping girls they both draw successful sketches of the Cantonment. Meanwhile, those teenagers express their will to join Surya Sen to drive the British out of the country. Surya Sen enlists them and trains them in martial arts, shooting and bomb-making. Masterda devises the plan to rock the British Empire by planning a raid on police lines Armoury, Cantonment, Telegraph office and Railway lines. Apart from Surya Sen, the group included Ganesh Ghosh, Lokenath Baul, Nirmal Sen, Ambika Chakraborty, Naresh Roy, Sasanka Datta, Ardhendu Dastidar, Harigopal Baul, Tarakeswar Dastidar, Ananta Singh, Jiban Ghoshal, Anand Gupta, Pritilata Waddedar, Kalpana Datta and the group of teenagers. The plan was put into action at 10 o'clock on 18 April 1930. As per plan, the armoury of the police was captured by a group of revolutionaries led by Ganesh Ghosh and another group of ten, led by Lokenath Baul took over the Auxiliary Force armoury. Unfortunately the guns were found but bullets were not there. So they had to burn the arms there only. The revolutionaries also succeeded in dislocating telephone and telegraph communications and disrupting the movement of the trains. After the successful raids, all the revolutionary groups gathered outside the police armoury where Surya Sen took a military salute, hoisted the National Flag and proclaimed a Provisional Revolutionary Government. The revolutionaries left Chittagong town before dawn and marched towards the Chittagong hill ranges, looking for a safe place, but the police by then with the support of British Army had them surrounded, but the British Army's first wave had been demolished by Masterda's Teenagers, this enraged the British and they bought machine guns and fired casualties in Masterda's side. Harigopal Baul  was first to be shot dead along with twelve others and the group had to flee leaving Ambika Chakraborty wounded, the Britishers found the dead bodies and burnt them with Petroleum. {{multiple image}} Meanwhile, Masterda had split the group into four and asked them to separate. While living with her sister in Patiya village the police under Major Cameron surrounded Masterda and tried to capture him but he was shot dead by Nirmal sen. While Nirmal got wounded, he asked Masterda to get out of there and henceforth sacrificing his own life fighting. Later eight young rebels led by Pritilata Waddedar attacked the European Club. After killing the officials the rebels fled and Pritilata committed suicide by swallowing Cyanide. Masterda escaped and retired to another house with Pritilata and other young rebels. Meanwhile the Police SP of Chittagong and other parts press hard crackdown on escaping rebel members and search for Masterda like anything. While, Masterda escaped, other members got arrested or killed in encounters with police while some members shot themselves like heroes to evade brutal torture by police. After few months, Haripada a young rebel decides to take revenge as he assassinates the SP who had an upper hand while suppressing the rebels, during an army football match. Finally, one night Masterda was encircled and was captured by police troopers he was trialled before the court and was sentenced to death by hanging, Surya Sen happily accepts the verdict. Before the death sentence, Surya Sen was brutally tortured by British executioners who break all his teeth, limbs and joints with hammer.

As they are watching a news program on television about anti-semitic attacks, Louise recognizes the person on TV: Samuel Bleistein, a prestigious Jewish lawyer, who was many years ago in love with her. Louise arranges a job interview for her daughter at Bleistein’s law firm. On his part, Samuel Bleistein receives the visit of his son Alex, who has comes to Paris to celebrate his son Nathan’s upcoming Bar mitzvah. Alex's encounter with his ex-wife Judith, who is Samuel’s assistant, is tense since they do no get along. Jeanne’s job interview is a disaster. Evidently she is ill qualified and badly prepared.

When all gather for dinner, Jeanne repeats the same story she told the police: that six youths approached her and, assuming she was Jewish , proceeded to beat her. After some extensive questioning, she decides to call it a night, but runs away and crosses a lake. Nathan helps Jeanne when it starts to rain hard and invites her into his little shack, a safe haven to get away from his parents once in a while. He notices she is all wet, and has her take off her clothes. Jeanne strips down and sits next to the fireplace with Nathan. She shows him her scars, as he still does not believe her story, but confesses in the end she made it up. Nathan convinces her to confess she lied. The next morning Jeanne tells the truth. Samuel has her write an apology. They travel back to Paris by train and Samuel and Louise share one more goodbye.

At the start of the film, Mulan lives with her aging father Hua Hu, a former soldier for the Northern Wei Dynasty. One day, envoys from the emperor arrive, announcing that an army is being mustered to fight off an invasion by the nomadic Rouran. As her father prepares to again go to war, Mulan, in the middle of the night, takes his armor and his sword and takes his place. In camp, she meets and befriends several other soldiers, including Xiaohu, a fellow villager who recognizes Mulan but promises to keep her gender a secret. She also meets Wentai, an officer who takes a liking to the young soldier. Mulan's identity is at jeopardy, however, when Mulan admits to stealing a jade pendant owned by another soldier to avoid participating in a strip search. Scheduled for execution, she is only saved when Wentai loosens her binds during a surprise attack by Rouran. Rather than escaping, Mulan proves her bravery when she turns the tide of battle by killing the enemy general. Mulan's exploits are rewarded and she and Wentai are promoted through the ranks of the army, eventually reaching the status of general. Despite their victories, Wentai realizes that Mulan is still too emotionally attached to both himself and to her men, and fakes his death after suffering an ambush by the Rouran. Hiding in the medical tent, Wentai watches as Mulan first falls into deep despair before eventually overcoming her grief to become one of the emperor's finest generals. After twelve years of fighting, the Rouran is near a breaking point. The foster son of the Rouran Dayan, Mendu nevertheless still thirsts for power and kills his less ambitious father to take the Rouran crown. Gathering an army of 200,000, he invades the Wei heartland once more. In response, Mulan develops a plan that will trap and eventually destroy the invasion, despite the Rouran superiority in men and supplies. She is given command of 20,000 soldiers and wins an early victory before retreat to a canyon. Awaiting support from the commander in chief of the Wei forces, she eventually finds herself betrayed by her superior when no supplies and no support is forthcoming. With an army slowly dying from thirst and wounds, Mulan prepares for a martyr's death when Wentai reveals himself to the Rouran as a prince of Wei, and offers himself in exchange for the safety of Mulan and her soldiers. As Mulan's soldiers retreat, she disguises herself as a Rouran soldier and sneaks into their camp. Mulan confronts Rouran princess who dreams of peace between the Wei and the Rouran tribes. She convinces the Rouran princess to aid her, and the two and Gude assassinate Mendu and rescue Wentai. Mulan returns to the Wei capital where she at last reveals herself as a woman and not a man. The Wei emperor nevertheless rewards her and announces that his son, Wentai, will marry the Rouran princess to bring peace to the lands. Mulan asks only to return to her native village. Later, Wentai pays a visit to Mulan's village and asks her to elope with him. Mulan, however, convinces Wentai the necessity of sacrificing for their country. Understanding this, Wentai sadly leaves the village.

After Roger's mom comes and asks Jake if Roger had said anything to him, she walks away, and Jake remembers that this all started during their freshmen year of high school. After Jake had made the winning basket in a basketball game, a freshman cheerleader named Amy invited him to a party but didn't want Roger to come. In the years later Jake joined a new group of friends, Amy became his girlfriend, and he became star of the basketball team. Jake grew further away from Roger, who became more of a loner. Three years later as a high school senior, Roger came in with a gun and shot himself. Roger died from his injuries and Jake wondered if he could have saved him by being a better friend. After the final basketball game of his senior year, Jake meets Chris, the pastor from Roger's funeral, and a youth pastor. Jake goes to a party that is disrupted by the police and, being slow to orient himself, is the last to sneak out of the house. He calls for a ride home from Chris, who reveals that Roger had come to church the Sunday before he killed himself. Chris expresses guilt that no one had really welcomed him there. Jake continues to struggle in dealing with Roger's death, attending church several times and drawing concern from Amy because of his withdrawn behavior. He discovers Roger's social networking page and sees that Roger had openly discussed his hopelessness. Amy joins Jake at church the following Sunday, but leaves after feeling judged. Jake confronts the group about their shallow faith and failure to be inclusive and inviting. Chris asks for a solution, and a girl named Andrea suggests that they all have lunch together at school. For the next few weeks they all meet at lunch everyday. Slowly, Jake becomes shunned from all of his old friends, including Amy. Jake invites Jonny , a boy who had been mocked by a fake invitation to a party, to join them, which he eventually does. Jonny starts to emerge from a dark side to a happier side of himself as Jake spends more time with him. After some time, Jonny asks Jake for advice on asking Andrea on a date. They go out for ice cream and Andrea sees scars on Jonny's wrist from cutting. She reveals that she used to be a cutter as well, touching his wrist. Jonny tries to kiss her, dropping his ice cream on her lap and causing her to draw back. Meanwhile, Jake finds out that Amy is pregnant with his baby and that she doesn't want to keep the child. He then discovers that his parents are about to have a divorce after his father had an affair. The next day at school, Jonny wants help from Jake on what to do with Andrea after he blew his chance. Jake takes his anger out on Jonny by brushing aside his concerns and humiliating him. Jake and Andrea attempt to patch things up with Jonny, but he ignores their calls and resumes cutting his wrists. Danny, the pastor's son, overhears Jake and Chris talking about Amy's pregnancy and posts drawings all over the school announcing the secret to the school. In the weeks that follow, Jake stops hanging out with his old friends for good and spends more time with his Christian friends. He gives up his dream about going to college, much to his father's disappointment, and persuades Amy to keep the baby, promising her that he will help her raise their child. Amy, having been shunned by all her old friends at school, starts spending time with Andrea and the other girls from church. Jake continues to call Jonny, but Jonny doesn't pick up his phone. Jonny bumps into Danny, who takes the cell phone Jonny dropped. Students are evacuated from the school due to a bomb threat. Danny steps forward and tells the police he thinks it was Jonny. The police search Jonny's locker and find horrific pictures of bombs exploding the school. They ask Jonny for his phone, but he doesn't have it, because Danny still does. The police handcuff Jonny and walk him through the crowd of the entire student body. Jake realizes that Jonny didn't make the threats when he calls Jonny's phone and sees Danny answer it. With Amy distracting the teachers that guard the exit, Jake runs past them to the road and steps in front of the police car. Jonny had opened a bottle of prescription pills preparing to take them, but Jake successfully stops the vehicle just before Jonny ends up like Roger. Danny is then caught by the police, but cannot bring himself to call his father, calling Chris instead. Chris leaves Danny alone, but Jake offers to stay with him. The pastor takes a leave of absence to spend time with Danny and Chris becomes the new pastor in his place. Jake's life soon returns to normal. His daughter is placed in open adoption, and Amy gets back together with Jake. His friends and family gather to see him off to Louisville for college, and his dad comes along with him so they can talk. Jonny gives Jake a note to read on the way there stating that he actually did feel like Roger and had thought about taking his life too.

After Roger's mom comes and asks Jake if Roger had said anything to him, she walks away, and Jake remembers that this all started during their freshmen year of high school. After Jake had made the winning basket in a basketball game, a freshman cheerleader named Amy invited him to a party but didn't want Roger to come. In the years later Jake joined a new group of friends, Amy became his girlfriend, and he became star of the basketball team. Jake grew further away from Roger, who became more of a loner. Three years later as a high school senior, Roger came in with a gun and shot himself. Roger died from his injuries and Jake wondered if he could have saved him by being a better friend. After the final basketball game of his senior year, Jake meets Chris, the pastor from Roger's funeral, and a youth pastor. Jake goes to a party that is disrupted by the police and, being slow to orient himself, is the last to sneak out of the house. He calls for a ride home from Chris, who reveals that Roger had come to church the Sunday before he killed himself. Chris expresses guilt that no one had really welcomed him there. Jake continues to struggle in dealing with Roger's death, attending church several times and drawing concern from Amy because of his withdrawn behavior. He discovers Roger's social networking page and sees that Roger had openly discussed his hopelessness. Amy joins Jake at church the following Sunday, but leaves after feeling judged. Jake confronts the group about their shallow faith and failure to be inclusive and inviting. Chris asks for a solution, and a girl named Andrea suggests that they all have lunch together at school. For the next few weeks they all meet at lunch everyday. Slowly, Jake becomes shunned from all of his old friends, including Amy. Jake invites Jonny , a boy who had been mocked by a fake invitation to a party, to join them, which he eventually does. Jonny starts to emerge from a dark side to a happier side of himself as Jake spends more time with him. After some time, Jonny asks Jake for advice on asking Andrea on a date. They go out for ice cream and Andrea sees scars on Jonny's wrist from cutting. She reveals that she used to be a cutter as well, touching his wrist. Jonny tries to kiss her, dropping his ice cream on her lap and causing her to draw back. Meanwhile, Jake finds out that Amy is pregnant with his baby and that she doesn't want to keep the child. He then discovers that his parents are about to have a divorce after his father had an affair. The next day at school, Jonny wants help from Jake on what to do with Andrea after he blew his chance. Jake takes his anger out on Jonny by brushing aside his concerns and humiliating him. Jake and Andrea attempt to patch things up with Jonny, but he ignores their calls and resumes cutting his wrists. Danny, the pastor's son, overhears Jake and Chris talking about Amy's pregnancy and posts drawings all over the school announcing the secret to the school. In the weeks that follow, Jake stops hanging out with his old friends for good and spends more time with his Christian friends. He gives up his dream about going to college, much to his father's disappointment, and persuades Amy to keep the baby, promising her that he will help her raise their child. Amy, having been shunned by all her old friends at school, starts spending time with Andrea and the other girls from church. Jake continues to call Jonny, but Jonny doesn't pick up his phone. Jonny bumps into Danny, who takes the cell phone Jonny dropped. Students are evacuated from the school due to a bomb threat. Danny steps forward and tells the police he thinks it was Jonny. The police search Jonny's locker and find horrific pictures of bombs exploding the school. They ask Jonny for his phone, but he doesn't have it, because Danny still does. The police handcuff Jonny and walk him through the crowd of the entire student body. Jake realizes that Jonny didn't make the threats when he calls Jonny's phone and sees Danny answer it. With Amy distracting the teachers that guard the exit, Jake runs past them to the road and steps in front of the police car. Jonny had opened a bottle of prescription pills preparing to take them, but Jake successfully stops the vehicle just before Jonny ends up like Roger. Danny is then caught by the police, but cannot bring himself to call his father, calling Chris instead. Chris leaves Danny alone, but Jake offers to stay with him. The pastor takes a leave of absence to spend time with Danny and Chris becomes the new pastor in his place. Jake's life soon returns to normal. His daughter is placed in open adoption, and Amy gets back together with Jake. His friends and family gather to see him off to Louisville for college, and his dad comes along with him so they can talk. Jonny gives Jake a note to read on the way there stating that he actually did feel like Roger and had thought about taking his life too.

During spring vacation, Hitomi is taking pictures for her school's photography club when she encounters a middle-aged man named Kajikawa, whose car is blocking the shot she was hoping to take. She later meets him again during a traffic jam while on her bicycle, and as they have dinner introduces herself as a 20-year-old college student. A few days later, she makes her way all the way to Tokyo and his workplace, and tags along with him to an evening party. On the anniversary of her mother's death, Hitomi discovers Kajikawa in an old photo of her mother's of a group hiking, and finds out that her mother and Kajikawa were once lovers, but that Kajikawa was the one who broke off the relationship. When Hitomi next encounters Kajikawa, she invites herself along for a drive to the location where that picture had been taken and tries to subtly question him about his memories of the place, to no avail. Later, over dinner, she drinks too much and tries to clumsily seduce him. Instead, he drives her back home, realizing that she's never kissed anyone before. Hitomi, determined to find out about her mother, slips the photo into his briefcase. She also finds out from her father that theirs was an arranged marriage. During a meeting at work, Kajikawa receives a call from Hitomi, asking if he's seen the photo, which he hasn't. He pulls it out, realizes what it is, and meets her later in a cafe where she finally tells him that she's the daughter of that woman, and that her mother has died. Kajikawa talks of their past relationship and refuses to apologize for either his actions or his moving forward with his life. Later, Hitomi sees Kajikawa heading into a hotel with another woman and follows them into the elevator. The other woman realizes immediately that Hitomi and Kajikawa have some kind of relationship, and forces the two together. In the hotel, Hitomi attempts to seduce Kajikawa again, saying she'll be just like her mother was, but Kajikawa refuses her and tells her to leave, locking himself in the bathroom. When Hitomi doesn't, and lays down in the hotel bed, Kajikawa begins pulling the covers off, which frightens her. Hitomi runs into the bathroom, Kajikawa throws her clothes at her, and the two leave the hotel in his car. Hitomi, calmer, keeps insisting that they stop at various love hotels, and when Kajikawa doesn't, grabs the steering wheel, causing an accident. In the hospital, her minor injuries patched up, Hitomi asks Kajikawa to kiss her, not in place of her mother but as herself. He does, and the kiss turns passionate. Kajikawa meets with Hitomi's father to both tell him about their relationship and to return the photograph. Hitomi's father tells Kajikawa that he was the man Hitomi's father could never forget. A subplot involving the relationship between one of Hitomi's classmates and a teacher at their school ends when that student commits suicide. At the funeral, Hitomi and Kajikawa talk again. Kajikawa has quit his job and will be returning to America, where he's been invited to join a friend's company. Hitomi turns up at the last minute to see Kajikawa off at the airport, something her mother did not do. Kajikawa confesses that he has fallen in love with her. Hitomi says thank you, and goodbye, then walks away through the airport. Over a still shot of the photo Hitomi took during her first encounter with Kajikawa, Hitomi can be heard talking to the same friend she was speaking to when the film opened. The friend says that she's a woman now she has experience, to which Hitomi counters that experience doesn't make a woman, that it is the pain of love, and that she herself is now a woman who has made a past for herself.

Hitomi runs into the bathroom, Kajikawa throws her clothes at her, and the two leave the hotel in his car. Hitomi, calmer, keeps insisting that they stop at various love hotels, and when Kajikawa doesn't, grabs the steering wheel, causing an accident. In the hospital, her minor injuries patched up, Hitomi asks Kajikawa to kiss her, not in place of her mother but as herself. He does, and the kiss turns passionate. Kajikawa meets with Hitomi's father to both tell him about their relationship and to return the photograph. Hitomi's father tells Kajikawa that he was the man Hitomi's father could never forget. A subplot involving the relationship between one of Hitomi's classmates and a teacher at their school ends when that student commits suicide. At the funeral, Hitomi and Kajikawa talk again. Kajikawa has quit his job and will be returning to America, where he's been invited to join a friend's company. Hitomi turns up at the last minute to see Kajikawa off at the airport, something her mother did not do. Kajikawa confesses that he has fallen in love with her. Hitomi says thank you, and goodbye, then walks away through the airport. Over a still shot of the photo Hitomi took during her first encounter with Kajikawa, Hitomi can be heard talking to the same friend she was speaking to when the film opened. The friend says that she's a woman now she has experience, to which Hitomi counters that experience doesn't make a woman, that it is the pain of love, and that she herself is now a woman who has made a past for herself.

Adam's journey through his mind is paralleled with a bike trip to Rutterburg, Vermont, with a package for his father. As he travels through several small towns, he starts to remember past events from his life. Adam's trip is prompted by a call from his girlfriend, Amy , who says her father met a reporter from Adam's alleged hometown of Rawlings, Pennsylvania, and the reporter had never heard of anyone named Farmer living there. Suspicious, Adam begins spying on his parents and finds two birth certificates with his name on them, but with different birthdates - Feb. 14  and July 14 . Adam confronts his father, who admits some shocking truths. Adam's real name is Paul Delmonte and the family was forced to relocate in a Witness Protection-type program after his father testified in state and federal trials against corrupt government officials. In reality, Adam is not biking to Vermont; he is riding in circles around the psychiatric facility where he has been held for the past three years, and the people he meets along the way are patients and workers at the facility. His ""journey"" is a quest to discover the whereabouts of his parents, who mysteriously disappeared . The memories Adam recounts are documented in ""psychiatric sessions,"" which are, in fact, interviews to determine whether or not he knows more about his father's involvement with the government than he's telling. Adam's final interview ends with two possible outcomes, neither of which bode well for the boy: ""Terminating"" him or continuing to questioning him until he dies."

Lucky, Matty, Terry, Chubby, Norman and Jay make up his unlikely gang of robbers. They initially set-up an airline check-in clerk as their alibi, by checking in to join the thousands of England supporters that are part of a mass exodus to the World Cup Tournament in Germany . Then, instead of passing through to departure lounge, the gang head out to the car park, pile into a van and head for Central London where they spectacularly ram raid London Exchange Bank, blocking any exit for those caught up inside. Their plan involves a tunnel they have dug up under the bank to funnel out the cash and themselves, all within a couple of hours, in order to catch their flight out to Germany. For this purpose, they have also set-up an accomplice among the hostages, who will later patch up their exit point from the bank and himself escape among the freed hostages once the police move in. However, as soon as they break-in, they have to contend with Chubby's leg wound that he has incurred after falling out of the van as it rams into the bank entrance. Chubby passes out soon thereafter from blood loss, forcing the gang to interact with the police camped outside and get a doctor brought in to the crime scene. All this while they are running on a short 2-hour deadline. Things go smoothly elsewhere, however, and they are able to hustle the bags of cash and themselves out the tunnel. However, right at the very end, Terry, the last man out, is trapped in the tunnel when a portion in the middle collapses. Alex sends everyone else off to the airport and frantically digs out Terry, ferrying him to the airport in a cab, where he makes his flight at the very last moment. At the end of the film, it is revealed that Chubby never recovered from his leg wound and died when the plane landed in Germany, resulting in the police able to match together evidence from the crime scene with Matty's identity and working backwards to piece together the gang's original plan. However, Alex who did not travel to Germany, was never caught and has since disappeared with the money. He is shown to be supporting the rest of the gang through their temporary prison terms as well as Chubby's widow.

Following the incidents, Nandini's family withdrew from the marriage with Balan and she was house arrested. When the money lenders legally acquired his house, there came a helping hand, Vikraman Contractor  who offered him the money but only if he was ready to marry his daughter.

In a terrific scene of departure, they decided to split calling it a ""sacrifice that they only can do"" for their families. Balan repaid his debts after his marriage to Rajeswari aka Raji , who was an arrogant woman and from whom Balan always faced miseries.

Following the harassment, Balan decided to move from his wife house but Raji refused to accompany him. Balan who felt insulted left alone from that house. He took a long leave and set out to a beach resort for some days of relaxation. There he found a middle aged funny man named Eenashu ([[Innocent  who always tried to keep himself young and spiritful through liquors and woman. His company made Balan forget his miseries and to start a new life. On a usual evening, Balan was shocked to see his childhood lover Nandini after long decades in his neighbouring cottage. She was still alone and had become an internationally acclaimed writer. Though they were lovers once, they were now not even able to talk freely each other. Gradually they began to share their life matters each other. On the beautiful beach side, they both shared wonderful evenings through which they were able to make them up the old couples- Balettan and Nandinikkutty. Balan who had changed a lot through Eenashu's company could easily rub the face of Raji from his mind. After long eves and mornings of romance, Balan and Nandini decided to live together thereafter. But still fate was haunting them. On the day they planned to leave, Balan had an unusual visitor, his wife Rajeswari and children. She realised her mistakes and asked him to forgive her. Balan felt senseless to hear this and he was confused what to do; however, he decided to accept his wife and children. He went to Nandini, who was all set to leave with him.

Zofia  is an elderly but sporty university professor who is friends with stamp-collecting neighbour Czesłav ""Root"" Janicki. Elżbieta , a woman in her forties, who is from New York but speaks excellent Polish and is clearly of Polish descent, is visiting the University of Warsaw. She goes to Zofia's ethics lecture. Elżbieta and Zofia are professional acquaintances from the USA, Elżbieta having translated Zofia's works, and the latter is glad to introduce her friend to the students. Zofia's lecture consists of the students posing ethical problems to be discussed in class. One of the students poses the case of a doctor and a woman who needs to have an abortion, the very dilemma that is the subject of Decalogue II. Elżbieta then gives an example on a real-life tale set in 1943, during World War II: a 6-year-old Jewish girl whose parents were sent to the ghetto is promised to get help from some willing Catholic family, yet the woman from the family refuses to provide the help and sends the girl away just before curfew. Zofia figures out that Elżbieta herself was the small girl left to an uncertain fate, and that it was she, Zofia, who refused to help her. Her initial explanation that, being Catholics, they couldn't lie about Elżbieta's fake baptism is not good enough. Zofia asks Elżbieta to dinner, but instead drives her to the house where the scene took place in 1943. Here she expresses her deep regret and explains the real reason she refused her help: Zofia's husband was an officer of the Polish resistance and there were reports that the invading Germans were posing fake Jews in order to hunt down resistance fighters who helped Jews. This doesn't take away the fact that Zofia went along with abandoning 6-year-old Elżbieta to near-certain death. Back at Zofia's apartment, Janicki, the neighbour, enters and proudly shows Zofia his series of 1931 German stamps that he has recently acquired. Zofia has had difficulties, over the years, living with what she did and didn't do during the war. Elżbieta asks to be taken to the family that had offered to help her, but when she gets there, the man, a tailor, refuses to speak about the war. Zofia tells her that he suffered a lot during and after the war and that is why he will not say anything. The story was based on an experience of the filmmakers' mutual friend, the journalist Hanna Krall.http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/krall-hanna http://www.film.u-net.com/Movies/Reviews/Dekalog_8.html Episode review http://www.facets.org/decalogue/synopsis.html Episode synopsis http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/decalogue_vol_4_parts_vii_and_viii/# Episode Synopsis and critical review"

Summer is just beginning, and while Milo wants his summer to be fun, his mother assigns him chores. When Milo's mother catches him breaking her ""no broccoli, no TV"" rule, she grounds and sends him to bed early. After a heated disagreement with her, Milo wishes that he never had a mother. Later that night, his wish comes true when his mom is kidnapped by Martians who plan to steal her ""momness"" to rear their own young. The Martians, led by their villainous supervisor  have been observing Earth mothers, passing up those who are too indulgent or unable to control their children. They select Milo's mother, based on her ability to command Milo to take out the trash. To rescue his mom, Milo stows away on a spaceship. Upon arrival on Mars, Milo is locked up in a jail cell, but manages to escape down a garbage chute where he meets a tech-savvy subterranean-dwelling earthling named Gribble . Gribble helps him devise a plan to save Milo's mom and get her back to Earth before Earth's night is up. Unfortunately, the plan goes awry at a Martian checkpoint, when Milo is exposed and the troops raid Gribble's hideout, but Milo is able to escape. While hiding from the guards, Milo meets an optimistic Martian girl named Ki  who is fascinated of Earth because of all its colors as opposed to the more stern and sleeker Mars. Milo makes it back to Gribble's hideout, and discovers Gribble has been kidnapped by the Supervisor and the Martians. After rescuing him, they take refuge under the tribes formed by Martians who are friendlier and free-spirited. Gribble confesses to Milo on how he wound up on Mars: twenty five years ago, the Martians selected Gribble's mother as a fine example to program their nannybots. Like Milo, Gribble stowed away, but failed to rescue his mother in time and was stranded on Mars. After Ki manages to locate Milo and Gribble in an untouched part of the Martian underground world, they come across an ancient cave painting that showed Martian families were like Earth families in the past. After evading the guards and capturing a spaceship, Milo manages to wake up his mother, and save her before the download destroys her. They tried to escape, but Supervisor halts them, and is about to kill Milo and his mother. Fortunately, Gribble saves them both and then, he gets into a fight with Supervisor, who fires a shot that causes Milo to trip and break his space helmet. As Milo begins to choke in the unbreathable Martian atmosphere, Milo's mother gives him her space helmet. Although Milo's life is saved, the life of his mother has now been put at stake. Before the eyes of the Martians, Gribble  manages to find the space helmet he'd attempted to save his mom with and gives it to Milo's mother, showing the Martians the one thing they'd overlooked about Earth moms: love for their children. Milo soon realizes that he was wrong to be rude to his mother and apologizes to her. The Supervisor attacks the Earthlings again and is about to recapture them, but Ki reveals the photo of the ancient cave painting and the Supervisor's deception to the soldiers, causing them to turn against the Supervisor. With the Supervisor in prison, Ki and Gribble return Milo and his mother to Earth, just before Milo's dad returns home. Having nowhere else to go and having exposed his feelings for Ki, Gribble decides to stay on Mars and returns there. Milo then takes out the trash before his mother asks him to, but secretly disintegrates it with a Martian weapon, similar to a human pistol in size and shape. Under the new leadership of Gribble and Ki, the male and female Martians work together in raising their young, while the Supervisor is stuck with nanny duty. Gribble manages to contact Milo and let him know how he is by using the Spirit rover as a communication station."

While going into an elevator to go to her hotel room, she meets Spencer Aimes . Spencer asks her out for drinks and she accepts. The scene then changes to Spencer sneaking onto a boat, putting a time bomb on the bottom of a helicopter, then taking out a guard. He then swims back and goes on the date with Jen. After a night of drinking, Jen reveals that she's not the spontaneous person she's been pretending to be and in return Spencer bluntly tells her that he's an assassin, albeit unhappy about being one. Unfortunately she's already passed out and hasn't heard. In spite of this, Spencer decides that Jen's the woman he's been looking for and decides to marry her. When Spencer tells his boss, Holbrook , his plan, the response is that quitting is not an option. Spencer is defiant and goes ahead with his plan. Three years later, they are settled into their new normal life. After Spencer surprises Jen with a remodeled office, she gives him a birthday surprise: tickets to Nice to celebrate his birthday and their three years. Because of his dubious connections to Nice, Spencer is less than enthusiastic. When her friends ask about his reaction, they take it as signs of that he might be getting bored and fill her head with doubts. Meanwhile, Spencer gets a postcard from his old boss and the ultimatum to take another assignment. While trying to refuse him long distance, Jen's father shows up to take Spencer to dinner, so Spencer hangs up the phone, prompting suspicion in Mr. Kornfeldt. This is fueled further when Jen's dad sees the postcard and quizzes him about the XOXX , being odd coming from a former boss. Stopping home to change, Spencer finds that the dinner invitation is just a detour to bring him to a surprise party. While Spencer navigates drunken friends, Jen's friends continue to fill her head with doubts over Spencer's lack of enthusiasm for the Nice trip. This is further irritated, when the following morning, despite her attempts to be physical with him, Spencer rushes Jen off on her business trip. A little while later, Jen comes back  to find Spencer being tossed around their house by Henry , Spencer's best friend and co-worker. Spencer screams for her to get his gun  and she shoots Henry in the arm. While interrogating the him, Henry reveals that there is a $20 million bounty on Spencer's head. An unidentified sniper takes shots at them, and Spencer and Jen flee. Henry goes after them, and after a car chase through the neighborhood, they end up in a construction zone, where Henry crashes his car. Spencer rams him into a trench, impaling his car on rebar and killing him. They then go to the hotel room where Spencer's old boss is staying, but find that someone has already killed him. Jen demands that they go to her dad for help, but Spencer disagrees. In the middle of their argument Jen vomits, and declares that she might be pregnant. Heading back to his office for Jen to take a pregnancy test, Spencer is attacked by his secretary  and realizes that there are others who know about the contract. Jen then reveals that she is pregnant and is leaving Spencer. Left alone, Spencer is attacked by a delivery driver, who is then run over and killed by Olivia , Henry's wife, another killer vying for the contract. She then tries to run over Spencer, but Jen returns and smashes Olivia's car into a fuel tank, which Spencer then shoots at and explodes, killing Olivia. The two discuss their possible future and return to their neighborhood, which is holding its annual block party. When they first arrive, they are attacked by two more assailants who, in a chase through backyards, crash their car, giving Jen and Spencer a chance to flee into the block party. As they walk through it, they receive many suspicious looks from neighbors. They enter their house to retrieve guns and their passports. Spencer is grabbing the guns when he is attacked by the two assailants again, whom he eventually kills. Meanwhile, one assassin, Kristen , one of Jen's best friends, holds Jen's mother as a hostage in a Mexican standoff with Jen. Jen's father arrives and kills Kristen. He then explains that he was the one who put out the bounty on Spencer. He knew of Spencer's previous work all along, and hired the neighbors and co-workers three years before, in case Spencer started working for his old boss again, who Jen's father says had ""gone dirty."" After seeing the postcard from Holbrook in Spencer's office, he came to the conclusion that Spencer had re-accepted his old job and activated the assassins. He reveals that he had been an operative as well, and that he was actually the target Spencer was supposed to kill in Nice three years earlier. In a standoff between Spencer and Jen's father, he does not trust that Spencer is really out of the game. Wanting to prove that he really did get out, Spencer drops his gun, and tells Jen's father he has no intention of killing him. Jen, now convinced, reveals her pregnancy to her parents. Jen's father, after killing one last wounded assassin, drops his gun as well. The family makes peace by building a trust circle, in which Spencer reveals that English is not his first language, and that he wanted to be the first one to say ""I love you"" to Jen. The movie ends showing Spencer and Jen's father working on some wires near Spencer and Jen's baby's crib. Spencer has just grown a moustache just like Jen's father. Spencer and Jen then leave to let Jen's mom and dad babysit. They all leave the room, but Spencer comes back in to activate the lasers protecting the baby."

She sets the money on the counter, revealing that she has two fingers missing on her right hand. As she sits at a table alone, a few people stare at her and a young boy asks his mother ""Why does that girl's face look like that?"" Finally, the girl snaps and bursts into tears, yelling how it is not her fault that her face looks like the way it does. In high school, an Indian-American boy named Ravi is constantly bullied and insulted by two jocks named Bradley and Bernard. A goth girl named Emily is taunted by a group of three popular girls named Kelli, Bridget, and Heather, who abuse her despite Emily's pleas that they could be friends. Another outcast named Dane is shown to having inherited an old secluded house in the woods from his late uncle's will. The outcasts are all invited to a video shoot by a popular boy named Kurtis. The outcasts agree that they like him and don't want him showing up at an upcoming party, Ravi stating that ""He's not one of them."" At the video shoot, Bradley and Bernard confront Ravi in the bathroom, breaking the camera after continuing with their usual taunts, going as far as to call Ravi a terrorist. Dane shows up to inform Ravi that the shoot is starting, and asks what happened. Bradley challenges Dane to a fight, to which Dane admits he cannot win. Bradley tells Dane that he bullies him because he knows Dane cannot do anything about it. Back at school, Kurtis finds out what happened and starts a fight with Bradley, fed up with the egotistic boy's attitude. Most of the outcasts are shown to have disturbing family lives: Dane's parents fight all the time; Ravi's family is cold and distant; Jack, a quiet boy who is skilled at playing the banjo, has a father that ignores him completely. The outcasts set up cameras and various equipment at Dane's house, where they lure all the popular kids, having sending out party invitations earlier. They lace the alcohol with a drug, causing everyone to fall unconscious. When the kids wake up, they find themselves chained together, with the outcasts all masked and wearing costumes inspired by horror movies. They want revenge for the years of torment and want to torture their worst enemies. A vulgar teenager named Miles decides that the entire thing is a stupid Halloween joke and starts to mouth off. As a result, Jack applies a cattle gun to his face and knee. One boy, Tommy, is allowed to go and get help, but his escape is cut short when he steps into a bear trap and is caught by a group of three boys nicknamed ""The Triplets"", who help the outcasts. Bernard is tortured with needles by Emily, after he is given a drug that attacks his muscular system, keeping him from moving or making much sound. Kurtis, who attended the party after all, is secretly given a key by Ravi and luckily escapes. Ravi is then stabbed by Dane and killed almost instantly, for betraying the group. Emily smears a paste on Heather's face that is made to slowly start disintegrating the skin it touches, leaving Heather horribly scarred. Bridget realizes that it is Emily and apologizes. She is given the chance to be spared by cutting off Bradley's fingers, but she refuses. Emily then offers Bradley safety if he agrees to cut off Bridget's fingers. Bradley cuts off two fingers on Bridget's right hand before Emily offers the deal to Bridget again. Bridget reluctantly agrees to cut off Bradley's fingers. Ultimately, she decides she cannot harm her friend and is punished by Emily, who smears the previously-used acidic compound on her face. Kurtis makes it to a neighbor's house, an elderly ex-soldier named Parker. He is suspicious of the fact that Kurtis showed up with a gun, and has the teen tied up for a period before Kurtis finally convinces him that there really is trouble. Parker goes to investigate, but is caught in a trap, severely injuring his legs. Despite the injuries, he manages to kill two of the triplets. Bradley is taunted by a now very insane Dane, and attempts to apologize, though this bears no fruit. Dane then uses his switchblade to sever Bradley's spinal cord, instantly paralyzing him from the waist down. Kurtis calls the police and returns to Dane's house, where he saves a boy named Riggs from getting his tongue cut off. However, Kurtis is shot in the arm by Dane after managing to kill Andy, one of the other outcasts. Dane is about to finish the job, but is shot by Emily, who has had enough. After one last hug, and Emily speaking her final words to Kelli, Jack kills Emily, just as the police arrive. The police burst through, demanding that Jack drop the gun, but he only points it to his own head, declaring that they are ""too late"" and that ""there are more of us out there"" before pulling the trigger. A news report recounts how the popular kids were abducted and tortured ""without reason"". Kelli, who remained unharmed, swallows a large amount of pills in the school's bathroom. At school, Kurtis exchanges looks with the remaining triplet. The final scene reveals that Bridget is the disfigured girl from the beginning of the movie."

For each chapter there is a title to the journey. Each chapter is animated with noticeably different styles. These vary in degree of difference and depict Dante with differing features, such as hair length, bodily proportions and armor.   - The film starts with Dante's return from the Third Crusade which has had him away from his home for several years. Speaking in inner monologue, he claims the forests he had been traveling in were gloomy and he would nearly prefer death over having to travel them. He admits he can detect someone following him, but each time he tries to approach, his pursuer vanishes without a trace. Upon arriving at home, he finds his servants slain, his father dead and his beloved fiancee Beatrice lying on the ground, dying of a stab wound to the stomach. As she dies, she is relieved Dante had kept his promise to her that he would return. As she dies, she turns into a spirit and begins to ascend into Heaven. However Lucifer, as a shadow, comes and takes her away through the gates into Hell. In pursuit, Dante comes to the gates and is briefly stalled before Virgil offers to guide him into hell. After Dante invokes his faith he is able to tear open the gates and enter hell.   - Upon Entry, Dante and Virgil board Charon, a demonic ferry that takes souls across into the First Circle of Hell. Charon does not take kindly to a mortal traveler on him, and sicks demons to attack Dante. Dante fights them off, but loses his sword in the process and so takes up one of the demons' scythe to defend himself from then on and kills Charon, crashing him into the coasts off the first circle.   - Virgil and Dante enter the first circle, Limbo which is home to mostly virtuous pagans and unbaptized babies. It is here Dante learns Beatrice was pregnant with his child while he was away, but was miscarried in the womb. Without time for sorrow, he is attacked by demonic children who quickly overwhelm him. As he and Virgil escape into a large building, they come across a hall of great rulers, philosophers and thinkers such as Aristotle, Plato and Socrates. Upon leaving they come across the spirit of Saladin, whose forces Dante had battled during his crusade. They move on, and eventually encounter King Minos whose task is to judge all condemned souls to their specific circle of hell. When he denies Dante access, they battle. Dante is able to kill Minos by dropping him onto his own spinning wheel of judgment. As Minos recedes, Dante and Virgil make their way down to the second circle. Meanwhile, Lucifer tortures Beatrice in a cycle of killing her, tricking her endlessly with the hope of rescue and taunting her that Dante had never kept his promises after he left.   - Falling onto the storm-ravaged shores of the second circle, Dante notices bodies flying through the wind, intertwined. Virgil explains the island is the second circle of Lust and those in the wind are caught in a never-ending storm of passion and may never know rest. Following Beatrice's cries from the distance, Dante ends up in a room of succubi who transform into hideous demons. As they try to kill him, he finally realizes he did break his promise to Beatrice; during the Crusade a woman offers sex to save her husband from being beaten to death. Having been under the illusion he was 'absolved' of all sin, he accepted. Upon hearing this, Beatrice begins to lose her faith yet refuses to see it as the truth as Lucifer offers her his hand in marriage.   - Coming to a grotto of men and women who had lived their lives without knowing fulfillment, so they suffer lacking it in death. Many starving individuals are caught and devoured by Cerberus and Virgil tells Dante the only way to the next circle is from within him. Dante allows himself to be eaten and he ends up inside of the hound of hell. Encountering Ciacco, a man he knew in life and feeling pity for his suffering, Dante uses his faith to release the man from the torture he had to endure. This provokes Lucifer's anger as he reveals his plan to marry Beatrice and that Dante's father is also in hell. In order to escape Cerberus' belly, Dante attacks and destroys the beast's heart, causing the demon to spit him up and spew him out in a river of blood that flows down into the next circle.   - Dante and Virgil's next circle is the ring of hell to men and women who wasted their lives in pursuit of material possessions. The condemned souls are tortured by being sheared in money presses, boiled in melted gold and buried in heavy gold coins. Within the circle, Dante confronts his father, having been promised a thousand years free of torture and endless gold if he would murder his own son. The pair battle fiercely, but Dante gains the upperhand, kicking his father into a vat of boiling gold.   - The fifth circle of hell is Anger as Virgil and Dante surmise when they can sense the very rage in the air. They proceed to the River Styx in which violence is still running rampant amongst the spirits fighting in the shallow waters. They climb aboard Phlegyas, a demonic giant who traverses the river while men and women who know of Dante taunt him from below. Dante has Phlegyas charge the city when he sees Lucifer within, announcing his intent to marry Beatrice to the damned souls within. When he strikes Phlegyas down, Dante chases after the devil. It is revealed further, more mundane orders from the king during the Crusades began to test Dante's patience, making him prone to anger and doubts on the value of the lives to their prisoners.   - The sixth circle of hell is for the heretics, people who have gone against the teaching of their churches. As they travel through halls of men and women who forever burn in fire and are forever tortured by various implements, Dante comes across Farinata, another man Dante hated in life, who taunts Dante by revealing Lucifer's plan to wed Beatrice and how he would be trapped in hell forever. Dante angrily kills Farinata just before fleeing the sixth circle and before it collapses from the force of Christ's death which, Virgil explains, quakes the circle eternally.   - Virgil helps Dante face the minotaur, guardian of the Circle of Violence, causing an easy defeat by allowing the beast's anger to get the better of him. Souls boiling in a vast river of blood from their own victims; violence they had inflicted upon others, Dante and Virgil enter the seventh circle: Violence, having been helped across the river by the centaur Nessus. Entering the Forest of Suicides, Dante hears a familiar cry and finds his mother growing from the sapling of a tree, forever in pain for killing herself and not finding the strength to stand up against her husband, Dante's father, she eventually hanged herself. Dante had been told, however, she had died because of a fever. Having been overwhelmed with sorrow, Dante uses his cross to free her soul. They move onto a graveyard within the Abominable Sands where his one time comrades and one of his close friends Francesco rise from the graves as undead warriors. The graveyard is where souls are condemned for committing acts of violence in the name of God. Feeling angry and vengeful of Dante, Francesco attacks him, matching Dante's scythe with his superior sword skills. Dante finally defeats Francesco by slicing his face in half. It is in this that Dante reflects upon slaughtering several heretics including men, women and children without mercy, due to a loss in rations and having to feed many prisoners, despite the Christian lives they themselves had spared. He again claims it was the war and not his fault, but at this point he seems to only be fooling himself.   - After being carried by the geryon, Virgil parts ways with Dante upon entering the realm of Fraud, the eighth circle, telling him he only needs to cross the bridge in order to stop the marriage of Beatrice and Lucifer who are on the opposite end of the bridge set to be married. As Dante starts crossing, he begins to reflect upon his own fraudulent behavior causing his physical strength and morale to fade. Finally he realizes his father, family servants and Beatrice were slain by the husband of the woman he had sex with and thus blames their deaths on himself. This slows him down at a crucial point, and Beatrice finally gives in to her sorrow of Dante's betrayal, wedding Lucifer and fully becoming a demon, losing her wings and rights to heaven. The demonized Beatrice proceeds to attack Dante, overpowering him and forces him to look on his greatest sin, letting him peer into the ninth circle of Treachery. He reflects that he allowed her brother to take the blame for his slaughtering of prisoners, and as a repercussion of his earlier sin of Lust. Overwhelmed with grief, he presents Beatrice her cross, which he had promised to give back to her upon his return from the crusade. She relents as he begs for forgiveness and pleads her to once again accept the love of God and she forgives him, causing her to return to her former angelic appearance. Virgil congratulates Dante for saving Beatrice as an angel descends from heaven to take Beatrice. Beatrice promises they will be together soon, but in order to leave hell and enter Purgatory he will need to face Lucifer alone.   - Descending into the cold underground of traitors, after wandering in the dark he comes across a lone female spirit who directs him to the very center of the caverns, but she brings to question whether or not to be trusted as her traitorous nature might hint she is lying, or not telling the whole truth. After wandering aimlessly, Dante comes across a cavern filled with large, frozen chains and he mows through them, only to encounter a three-faced demon in the center who appears to be Lucifer's corporeal form, having been freed by the breaking of his chains he attacks Dante. Dante slays the beast and is within inches of entering Purgatory where his salvation awaits; however, Lucifer, now freed from his frozen form and reveals his true form, breaks free and easily overpowers Dante, threatening to enter Purgatory and move on to Paradise to bring hell to heaven itself. Dante realizes he cannot stop Lucifer on his own, and using every bit of faith in himself, he begs to sacrifice his own soul to prevent Lucifer from moving into Purgatory, repenting of his sins and begging for forgiveness and the power to trap Lucifer with him forever. Upon hearing cries for repentance in a sacred and dark place, Lucifer runs back, trying to stop Dante from making this pact; however, he is stopped by a powerful force of light that freezes him solid. Free to move on, Dante dives into the well that would send him to Purgatory, to be with Beatrice. ""Neither completely living, nor completely dead"" as he puts it. That night the sins he ripped off his chest had transformed into a serpent who is believed to be Lucifer waiting to get his revenge."

For each chapter there is a title to the journey. Each chapter is animated with noticeably different styles. These vary in degree of difference and depict Dante with differing features, such as hair length, bodily proportions and armor.   - The film starts with Dante's return from the Third Crusade which has had him away from his home for several years. Speaking in inner monologue, he claims the forests he had been traveling in were gloomy and he would nearly prefer death over having to travel them. He admits he can detect someone following him, but each time he tries to approach, his pursuer vanishes without a trace. Upon arriving at home, he finds his servants slain, his father dead and his beloved fiancee Beatrice lying on the ground, dying of a stab wound to the stomach. As she dies, she is relieved Dante had kept his promise to her that he would return. As she dies, she turns into a spirit and begins to ascend into Heaven. However Lucifer, as a shadow, comes and takes her away through the gates into Hell. In pursuit, Dante comes to the gates and is briefly stalled before Virgil offers to guide him into hell. After Dante invokes his faith he is able to tear open the gates and enter hell.   - Upon Entry, Dante and Virgil board Charon, a demonic ferry that takes souls across into the First Circle of Hell. Charon does not take kindly to a mortal traveler on him, and sicks demons to attack Dante. Dante fights them off, but loses his sword in the process and so takes up one of the demons' scythe to defend himself from then on and kills Charon, crashing him into the coasts off the first circle.   - Virgil and Dante enter the first circle, Limbo which is home to mostly virtuous pagans and unbaptized babies. It is here Dante learns Beatrice was pregnant with his child while he was away, but was miscarried in the womb. Without time for sorrow, he is attacked by demonic children who quickly overwhelm him. As he and Virgil escape into a large building, they come across a hall of great rulers, philosophers and thinkers such as Aristotle, Plato and Socrates. Upon leaving they come across the spirit of Saladin, whose forces Dante had battled during his crusade. They move on, and eventually encounter King Minos whose task is to judge all condemned souls to their specific circle of hell. When he denies Dante access, they battle. Dante is able to kill Minos by dropping him onto his own spinning wheel of judgment. As Minos recedes, Dante and Virgil make their way down to the second circle. Meanwhile, Lucifer tortures Beatrice in a cycle of killing her, tricking her endlessly with the hope of rescue and taunting her that Dante had never kept his promises after he left.   - Falling onto the storm-ravaged shores of the second circle, Dante notices bodies flying through the wind, intertwined. Virgil explains the island is the second circle of Lust and those in the wind are caught in a never-ending storm of passion and may never know rest. Following Beatrice's cries from the distance, Dante ends up in a room of succubi who transform into hideous demons. As they try to kill him, he finally realizes he did break his promise to Beatrice; during the Crusade a woman offers sex to save her husband from being beaten to death. Having been under the illusion he was 'absolved' of all sin, he accepted. Upon hearing this, Beatrice begins to lose her faith yet refuses to see it as the truth as Lucifer offers her his hand in marriage.   - Coming to a grotto of men and women who had lived their lives without knowing fulfillment, so they suffer lacking it in death. Many starving individuals are caught and devoured by Cerberus and Virgil tells Dante the only way to the next circle is from within him. Dante allows himself to be eaten and he ends up inside of the hound of hell. Encountering Ciacco, a man he knew in life and feeling pity for his suffering, Dante uses his faith to release the man from the torture he had to endure. This provokes Lucifer's anger as he reveals his plan to marry Beatrice and that Dante's father is also in hell. In order to escape Cerberus' belly, Dante attacks and destroys the beast's heart, causing the demon to spit him up and spew him out in a river of blood that flows down into the next circle.   - Dante and Virgil's next circle is the ring of hell to men and women who wasted their lives in pursuit of material possessions. The condemned souls are tortured by being sheared in money presses, boiled in melted gold and buried in heavy gold coins. Within the circle, Dante confronts his father, having been promised a thousand years free of torture and endless gold if he would murder his own son. The pair battle fiercely, but Dante gains the upperhand, kicking his father into a vat of boiling gold.   - The fifth circle of hell is Anger as Virgil and Dante surmise when they can sense the very rage in the air. They proceed to the River Styx in which violence is still running rampant amongst the spirits fighting in the shallow waters. They climb aboard Phlegyas, a demonic giant who traverses the river while men and women who know of Dante taunt him from below. Dante has Phlegyas charge the city when he sees Lucifer within, announcing his intent to marry Beatrice to the damned souls within. When he strikes Phlegyas down, Dante chases after the devil. It is revealed further, more mundane orders from the king during the Crusades began to test Dante's patience, making him prone to anger and doubts on the value of the lives to their prisoners.   - The sixth circle of hell is for the heretics, people who have gone against the teaching of their churches. As they travel through halls of men and women who forever burn in fire and are forever tortured by various implements, Dante comes across Farinata, another man Dante hated in life, who taunts Dante by revealing Lucifer's plan to wed Beatrice and how he would be trapped in hell forever. Dante angrily kills Farinata just before fleeing the sixth circle and before it collapses from the force of Christ's death which, Virgil explains, quakes the circle eternally.   - Virgil helps Dante face the minotaur, guardian of the Circle of Violence, causing an easy defeat by allowing the beast's anger to get the better of him. Souls boiling in a vast river of blood from their own victims; violence they had inflicted upon others, Dante and Virgil enter the seventh circle: Violence, having been helped across the river by the centaur Nessus. Entering the Forest of Suicides, Dante hears a familiar cry and finds his mother growing from the sapling of a tree, forever in pain for killing herself and not finding the strength to stand up against her husband, Dante's father, she eventually hanged herself. Dante had been told, however, she had died because of a fever. Having been overwhelmed with sorrow, Dante uses his cross to free her soul. They move onto a graveyard within the Abominable Sands where his one time comrades and one of his close friends Francesco rise from the graves as undead warriors. The graveyard is where souls are condemned for committing acts of violence in the name of God. Feeling angry and vengeful of Dante, Francesco attacks him, matching Dante's scythe with his superior sword skills. Dante finally defeats Francesco by slicing his face in half. It is in this that Dante reflects upon slaughtering several heretics including men, women and children without mercy, due to a loss in rations and having to feed many prisoners, despite the Christian lives they themselves had spared. He again claims it was the war and not his fault, but at this point he seems to only be fooling himself.   - After being carried by the geryon, Virgil parts ways with Dante upon entering the realm of Fraud, the eighth circle, telling him he only needs to cross the bridge in order to stop the marriage of Beatrice and Lucifer who are on the opposite end of the bridge set to be married. As Dante starts crossing, he begins to reflect upon his own fraudulent behavior causing his physical strength and morale to fade. Finally he realizes his father, family servants and Beatrice were slain by the husband of the woman he had sex with and thus blames their deaths on himself. This slows him down at a crucial point, and Beatrice finally gives in to her sorrow of Dante's betrayal, wedding Lucifer and fully becoming a demon, losing her wings and rights to heaven. The demonized Beatrice proceeds to attack Dante, overpowering him and forces him to look on his greatest sin, letting him peer into the ninth circle of Treachery. He reflects that he allowed her brother to take the blame for his slaughtering of prisoners, and as a repercussion of his earlier sin of Lust. Overwhelmed with grief, he presents Beatrice her cross, which he had promised to give back to her upon his return from the crusade. She relents as he begs for forgiveness and pleads her to once again accept the love of God and she forgives him, causing her to return to her former angelic appearance. Virgil congratulates Dante for saving Beatrice as an angel descends from heaven to take Beatrice. Beatrice promises they will be together soon, but in order to leave hell and enter Purgatory he will need to face Lucifer alone.   - Descending into the cold underground of traitors, after wandering in the dark he comes across a lone female spirit who directs him to the very center of the caverns, but she brings to question whether or not to be trusted as her traitorous nature might hint she is lying, or not telling the whole truth. After wandering aimlessly, Dante comes across a cavern filled with large, frozen chains and he mows through them, only to encounter a three-faced demon in the center who appears to be Lucifer's corporeal form, having been freed by the breaking of his chains he attacks Dante. Dante slays the beast and is within inches of entering Purgatory where his salvation awaits; however, Lucifer, now freed from his frozen form and reveals his true form, breaks free and easily overpowers Dante, threatening to enter Purgatory and move on to Paradise to bring hell to heaven itself. Dante realizes he cannot stop Lucifer on his own, and using every bit of faith in himself, he begs to sacrifice his own soul to prevent Lucifer from moving into Purgatory, repenting of his sins and begging for forgiveness and the power to trap Lucifer with him forever. Upon hearing cries for repentance in a sacred and dark place, Lucifer runs back, trying to stop Dante from making this pact; however, he is stopped by a powerful force of light that freezes him solid. Free to move on, Dante dives into the well that would send him to Purgatory, to be with Beatrice. ""Neither completely living, nor completely dead"" as he puts it. That night the sins he ripped off his chest had transformed into a serpent who is believed to be Lucifer waiting to get his revenge."

The story is told in loops and flashbacks. With the opening and final scenes at Niagara Falls, the bulk of the film depicts the events leading to the funeral scene shown at the beginning. In the background looms the tragedy of the suspicious death years ago of the first-born son; a pervasive and never spoken of subject. The household is ruled by Jim Field basing on his experiences in the military, as is illustrated by a flashback sequence to the two weeks he forced his family to spend trapped in the self-built backyard bomb shelter, for ""practice"". Jim works as a used-car salesman and he is keen on keeping up appearances in front of the neighbors. He is psychologically unstable, drinks heavily and cheats on his wife although he is also oddly protective of her, insisting that his daughters watch her all the time. His depressed wife Mary, a onetime dancer, has escaped into apathy and alcoholism a long time ago. She lives a catatonic life on the living room couch, staring absently at the television, her ever-present coffee cup full of whiskey impassively filled by one family member or the other. Each of the three teenaged daughters has her own way to cope with the deleterious family atmosphere. They try to make their own experiences while struggling with their family duties and concern for their mother. Norma is the eldest daughter and the most responsible element of the family; quiet, subdued and selfless, she overburdens herself with domestic tasks and responsibilities, and patiently puts up with her father's antics. She is also the only one intent on keeping the memory of her brother and on uncovering the secret around his death. After unexpectedly becoming friends with a neighboring girl, she lets some pleasure into her dreary life. As the opposite of Norma, middle child Lou fights for her independence, standing up to her father and loving her mother but despising her weakness. She assuages her fantasies of rebellion, experimenting with boys and drugs. Not as involved as Norma in the housekeeping, nor as rebellious as Lou, sweet-looking Sandy devotes herself to becoming a perfect woman, with her own naive sense of femininity and sexuality. She engages in an affair with an older, married shoe salesman which ends up an awkward threesome scene with the man's twin brother, and Sandy learning that she is pregnant. The story builds from one small event to another. Things climax during one long New Year's Eve night, as a dramatic event and the final admission of the secret definitively put an end to the Fields' ""pretend normal"" family life. The ending is left open, leaving the viewer to guess whether or not the characters will be able to start a new and more honest life and reconstruct family bonds."

Doug Madison is assigned the case in court, but doesn't believe in Braden's innocence until Ellen is seen diving into the lake, attempting to retrieve the gun.

After a conviction and death sentence for Braden, it comes to Madison's attention that an ex-con named Max Verne had worked for the dead man and made threats after being dismissed.

Incorrigible, the 18-year-old Frankie resists all efforts to get through to him by social worker Ben Wagner or his worried mother, who was abandoned by Frankie's father. McAllister isn't afraid of Frankie and even slaps him. An angry Frankie informs his friends Lou Macklin and Angelo ""Baby"" Gioia that he intends to kill McAllister now, which frightens Frankie's 10-year-old brother Richie, who overhears. Baby's dad slaps him and orders him to stop hanging out with the no-good Frankie. An effort is made by Wagner to understand the boys rather than be angry with them, and Richie tells him of Frankie's plans to commit murder. McAllister is trapped in an alley at 1:30 in the morning.

The story gradually reveals that the crimes are to cover up a Japanese American cabal's efforts to facilitate Japan's bombing of Pearl Harbor. After the horrific military attack, the Japanese American community's demonstrations of pro-U.S. patriotism are portrayed as patently insincere. Policeman Steele tracks the crime trail to an American-born spy for Tokyo, Takimura . Takimura tries to throw Steele off the case by enlisting a neighborhood vixen, Teru  to seduce him. Teru invites Mike to Satsuma's house, where she drugs him. As Mike sleeps, Hendricks and Takimura kill Teru and make it look as if Mike murdered her while trying to assault her. Mike is arrested for the murder, and the next morning, is in prison when he learns of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Mike then escapes from jail and soon discovers where Takimura, Hendricks and the others meet. With Maris' help, Mike tricks the spies into revealing their activities while the police listen, and soon the gang is rounded up. After Japanese Americans on the West Coast are taken to internment camps, Little Tokyo becomes a ghost town. The movie ends extolling the necessity for the internment with Maris commenting on her radio show that loyal Japanese Americans must suffer along with the disloyal in the interest of national security.

It is a circular motion, which travels a long walk through a dream-like landscape in the countryside, along winding dirt roads. At each of their brief stops on the journey is a moment of contemplation, caresses, and tender murmurs. These soft murmurs tell of the mother's love for her son when she was nurturing him and of the son's love for his mother as he opens for her the mysterious path to her death. They progress under the leaden and luminous ski of the Baltic, in totally isolated landscapes. From time to time, there is a far away train or a sail on the sea, emphasizing further their isolation from the rest of the world They return to the house. The son tenderly lowers his mother into her bed, which now seems to resemble a coffin. Both know that the end is nearing, although he tries to reassure her to the contrary. He leaves her for a time and goes for a long, solitary walk. When he returns, his mother may have died.

Hoffmanstahl opens the package, triggering a hidden bomb that is prevented from detonating by the intervention of Sherlock Holmes . Holmes takes the letter and disposes of the bomb while Adler and Hoffmanstahl escape. Holmes later finds Hoffmanstahl assassinated. Adler meets with Professor Moriarty  to explain the events, but Moriarty poisons her — deeming her position compromised by her love for Holmes. Some time later, Dr Watson  arrives at 221B Baker Street, where Holmes discloses that he is investigating a series of seemingly unrelated murders, terrorist attacks and business acquisitions that he has connected to Moriarty. Holmes meets with a French Manouche Gypsy fortune-teller Simza , the intended recipient of the letter he had taken from Adler, sent by her brother Rene. Holmes defeats an assassin sent to kill Simza, but she flees before Holmes can interrogate her. After the wedding of Watson and Mary Morstan , Holmes meets Moriarty for the first time. Moriarty informs Holmes that he murdered Adler and will kill Watson and Mary if Holmes' interference continues with the case. Moriarty's men attack Watson and Mary on a train to their honeymoon. Holmes, having followed the pair for protection, throws Mary from the train into a river below where she is picked up by Holmes' waiting brother, Mycroft . After defeating Moriarty's men, Holmes and Watson travel to Paris to locate Simza. When she is found, Holmes tells Simza that she has been targeted because Rene is working for Moriarty, and may have told her about his plans. Simza takes the pair to the headquarters of an anarchist group to which she and Rene had formerly belonged. They learn that the anarchists have been forced to plant bombs for Moriarty. The trio follows Holmes' deduction that the bomb is in the Paris Opera. However, Holmes realises too late that he has been tricked and that the bomb is in a nearby hotel; the bomb kills a number of assembled businessmen. Holmes discovers that the bomb was a cover for the assassination of Meinhard, one of the attendees by Moriarty's aide, Sebastian Moran . Meinhard's death grants Moriarty ownership of Meinhard's weapons factory in Heilbronn, Germany. Holmes, Watson and Simza travel there, following clues in Rene's letters. At the factory, Moriarty captures, interrogates and tortures Holmes while Watson is under sniper fire from Moran. Holmes spells out Moriarty's horrific plot, revealing that the Professor secretly acquired and owns shares in multiple war profiteering companies, and intends to instigate a world war to make himself a fortune. Meanwhile, Watson uses the cannon he had been hiding behind to destroy the lighthouse in which Moran is concealed. The structure collapses into the warehouse where Moriarty is holding Holmes captive. Watson, Simza, and an injured Holmes reunite and escape aboard a moving train. Holmes deduces that Moriarty's final target will be a peace summit in Switzerland, creating an international incident. At the summit, Holmes reveals that Rene is the assassin and that he is disguised as one of the ambassadors, having been given radical reconstructive surgery by Hoffmanstahl to alter his appearance. Holmes and Moriarty, who is also in attendance, retreat outside to discuss their competing plans. Watson and Simza find Rene and stop his assassination attempt, but Rene is himself silenced by Moran. Outside, Holmes reveals that he previously replaced Moriarty's personal diary that contained all his plans and financing with a duplicate. The original was sent to Mary in London, who decrypted the code using a book that Holmes had noticed in Moriarty's office during their first meeting. Mary passes the information to Inspector Lestrade  who seizes the bulk of Moriarty's assets, financially crippling him. Holmes and Moriarty anticipate an impending physical confrontation, and both realise Moriarty would win due to Holmes' injured shoulder. Holmes instead grapples Moriarty and forces them both over the balcony and into the Reichenbach waterfall below. Their bodies are not found. Following Holmes' funeral, Watson and Mary prepare to have their belated honeymoon when Watson receives a package containing a breathing device of Mycroft's that Holmes had noticed before the summit. Contemplating that Holmes may still be alive, Watson leaves his office to find the delivery man. Holmes, having concealed himself in Watson's office, reads Watson's memoirs on the typewriter and adds a question mark after the words ""The End"".."

Through human interference of the local environment, the megapiranha manage to escape from their isolated spot and swim downstream, killing all that crosses their path. The megapiranha gradually make their way towards Florida at the height of the tourist season.Mega Piranha at The Asylum After the outbreak, a team including Special Agent Fitch and Sarah Monroe, work to contain the megapiranhas within Venezuela. They begin to get into trouble with the authorities when they attempt to cross over the Venezuelan border. Not having proper clearance and documentation, Special Agent Fitch resorts to using the diplomacy of his fist and drives off. He is pursued by Colonel Antonio Diaz in a high-speed chase through the jungle. Throughout the chase, Fitch alternates driving a Toyota Camry and Hyundai Elantra while Diaz is seen at different points in a GMC Jimmy, Chevrolet Suburban, Suzuki XL7, and Ford Explorer. Fitch escapes by stealing a helicopter and heads to the International Super Bunker . During the journey, the helicopter runs out of fuel and Sarah Monroe rigs the emergency oxygen tank to the fuel line to make it to the ISB safely. The megapiranhas continue to move north, consuming two battleships and a nuclear submarine. They eventually reach south Florida, where they kill at least five Puerto Ricans on a beach and manage to blow up two hotels. Meanwhile, the only force that can stop them is located at the ISB. After the megapiranhas prove impervious to both torpedoes and depth charges—and even a nuclear missile fails to stop them—Special Agent Fitch and Professor Sarah Monroe conclude that the only way to stop the megapiranhas is to face them in their own terrain: underwater. An army of SCUBA divers armed with guns would make the huge fish bleed, causing them to enter a feeding frenzy and kill each other. If this were to fail, then a massive nuclear strike would be used to destroy the megapiranha, as well as most of Florida. In the middle of the operation, Colonel Diaz arrives in a helicopter, presumably using multiple oxygen tanks to fuel his journey. The Colonel aims to get revenge on Agent Fitch and throws a rope into the water to trick him into climbing up into the enemy helicopter. Fitch, upon his arrival, shoots the pilot in the mouth with a flare gun, which causes the pilot's head to explode. Fitch then uses a homing beacon  to attract a megapiranha, jumping out of the helicopter shortly before it is consumed by the fishy behemoth. Fitch is pursued by the megapiranha that ate the helicopter, eventually hiding in a reef where the megapiranha is unable to follow. When the piranha opens its mouth, Fitch shoots his gun at the helicopter still in the beast's jaws. The helicopter explodes, killing the piranha. The other megapiranha converge on the bloodshed and Fitch is able to escape as the piranha enters a feeding frenzy and begin tearing each other to pieces, seemingly resulting in them wiping themselves out. Sarah and Fitch make out and all is well.

Eight candidates are seen dressing for what appears to be an employment assessment exam. They enter a room and sit down at individual desks. Each desk contains a paper with the word 'candidate' and a number - 1 to 8 - on. The Invigilator, a representative of the company, explains that the exam takes 80 minutes and consists of one question only, and that there are three rules: do not talk to the Invigilator or the armed guard at the door, do not spoil the paper or allow it to be spoilt, and do not leave the room. Not obeying the rules will result in disqualification. He asks them if they have any questions - no-one replies. After the clock starts, it turns out that the question papers are blank. One candidate is immediately removed from the room for spoiling her paper by writing on it. The seven remaining candidates realize they can talk to each other and work together. ""White"", who is arrogant and rude, suggests nicknames based on physical appearance: Black, White, Brown, Blonde, Brunette, and Dark, refer to their skin and hair colors, and Deaf is for one candidate who does not pay attention to the others. The candidates use the lights, bodily fluids and fire sprinklers to try to reveal a hidden question on the paper, with no luck. White takes control of the group but really works against them, engineering the disqualifications of Brunette and Deaf. White then taunts the others, saying he knows the question but will not tell the rest. It is revealed that the company in question is responsible for a miracle drug which a large part of the population are dependent upon after a viral pandemic. Black subdues White and ties him to a chair, calling him a distraction to the group. White says he is infected with The Virus and needs his medication, but the others do not believe him. Dark suggests White is actually a plant from the company, and demonstrates much knowledge about the internal workings of the company. This leads Brown to accuse her of being a plant, and tortures her into revealing that she works for the company, but is still applying for the job like everyone else. Just then White goes into convulsions, proving he has the disease. Dark asks the unseen invigilator for help and is disqualified. Blonde finds that Brown was hiding the medication White brought for himself. She retrieves it from the vent that ""Brown"" had thrown it into and gives it to White. The others release White and want to know the question, but he says the only explanation is that there is no question; the company is going to hire the last remaining candidate. White attacks the others and grabs a gun from the guard - he finds it is fingerprint sensitive and manipulates the guard's hand to work it. White forces Brown to leave the room. Blonde is next, but she turns off the voice activated lights, allowing Black to attack White. When the lights are turned on Black is dead from a gunshot, and Blonde, only having partially left the room  is still in the running. The clock then runs to zero. White addresses the Invigilator to say he is best candidate, but is disqualified; it is revealed Deaf had earlier set the countdown forward by a few minutes and the eighty minutes has not completed. With only Blonde left, she remembers that Deaf had been using his glasses and a piece of broken glass with an exam paper earlier, but had been ignored. Taking the abandoned glasses, she finds the words 'Question 1' on the exam paper in invisible writing. Blonde realizes that Question 1 refers to the only question asked of them - the ""Any questions?"" by the Invigilator before the exam began, and answers ""no"". The Invigilator and Deaf enter; it is revealed Deaf is actually the CEO of the company and inventor of the cure for The Virus, which can also heal any wound. The bullet that hit Black contained this cure, and he awakens, healed. With the drug about to be released to the public, the company needed to hire someone who was not only able to make tough choices but who is also compassionate, which Blonde had demonstrated throughout the exam. Blonde passes the exam and accepts her new job."

Sylvester abruptly notices this, finding that he is locked inside an empty house devoid of food with no milk being delivered for two weeks. Fortunately, he finds a cupboard full of canned tuna and cat food, but discovers that he also needs a can opener. He seemingly cannot find one, until he sees a mouse with it. He begs the mouse to give it, but the mouse throws it in his hole. Sylvester frantically tries and fails to retrieve it and the mouse casually walks away. Sylvester angrily gives chase and crashes into the mouse's hole while trying to catch him. Sylvester tries vainly to open the tuna by beating it against the floor and jumping on it. When this doesn't work he tries to chop it with an axe, but when he's about to swing the blade flies off and goes out the mail slot. The mouse throws the can opener out into the open, giving Sylvester a chance to retrieve it but he fails when the mouse grabs it and runs back into his hole, causing Sylvester to crash into it again. Next, Sylvester tries using an unbent coat hanger to retrieve the can opener, however the mouse hooks it to a live wire and he receives an electric shock when the wire touches another. Sylvester then sets up a piano to drop on the can, just before the mouse offers the can opener, prompting Sylvester to release his hold on the rope attached to the piano, thereby crushing him. He then attempts to cut a larger hole in the wall to enter the mouse's home, but is foiled  by the mouse cutting the floor beneath Sylvester's feet. His next attempt involves dynamite, which predictably backfires after the mouse inflates and pops a paper bag making him think the dynamite had already blown. His following attempt, involving a vacuum, results in Sylvester being sucked in, along with hot coals, and clumsily tumbling down into the basement while trying to hit the mouse with a golf club. However, the angrily persistent cat (thinking that that's the [[Drop  returns with an armful of dynamite and fireworks, but they blow prematurely while he's lighting the fuse, resulting in a tremendous explosion and he does finally recover the can opener in the process. Going to the cupboard and yelling ""I got it"" along the way, he finds that it is now locked and the mouse has the key. Sylvester let out a cry of anguish and faints while the mouse merely shrugs and twirls the key on his finger."

There is a crowd of young people listening to the loud music and the group frontman/singer, Artur . A guy wading through the crowd of punkers, Jerzy , waves frantically to the group and it becomes clear that he knows the frontman. It is his older brother. Jerzy informs Artur that their father Czesław ""Root"" Janicki has died. It is not a great emotional loss, since they were not close and have not seen each other for a long time. They arrive at their father's flat which is very dirty and does not have much furniture inside. However, it is steel-doored, multi-locked and heavily alarmed. They find out that there is a big collection of stamps inside the flat. They are also approached by a shady character who says that their father owed him a lot of money and even offers to take ""something from the flat"" just to see if he could take it as payment. None of them is an expert on stamps  but they try to find out how much they can get for them. Jerzy gives a series of Weimar Republic Flugpost Polarfahrt 1931 Zeppelin stamps to his son. Artur goes to a stamp collectors' show and there he meets the president of their association who recognizes the son of ""Root"" Janicki; he meets both brothers at their father's apartment and there he tells them that the entire collection is worth millions. Jerzy is appalled to learn that his son traded the Zeppelin stamps for hundreds of worthless stamps. He tracks the stamps down to a shady store owner who has covered his tracks all too well to call the police. Artur and Jerzy spend a lot of money in new alarms for the apartment and even a dog. Artur comes up with a scheme to force the store owner to give him the Zeppelin stamps back. After succeeding, this man tells them about the Austrian rose Mercury, an incomplete series of which they own two of the three. If they complete the series, the value of the whole might be extremely high, but to acquire the stamp Jerzy has to donate his kidney, since the man in possession of the stamp is in need of a kidney for his daughter and as the store owner sets it, these kinds of valuable items are not bought but exchanged. Returning from the hospital, Jerzy and Artur find that they have been robbed... The entire stamp collection is gone except for the dog and the missing stamp. They report each other to the police but are later reconciled after they come across the other characters in the film with a sudden look of newly acquired wealth. http://www.film.u-net.com/Movies/Reviews/Dekalog_10.html Episode review http://www.facets.org/decalogue/synopsis.html Episode synopsis http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/decalogue_vol_4_parts_viii_and_ix/# Episode Synopsis and critical review"

Kosuke Matsuyama , is a second-year high school student. A nice, normal, nonviolent type, he suddenly finds himself in the middle of a rampaging crowd of Korean boys, outraged by insults perpetrated by several of his idiotic class-mates on two Korean girls. He makes a narrow escape, but soon after, he and his best bud Yoshio  are sent by their home-room teacher to invite the Korean students to a friendly soccer game as a way of restoring the peace. Trembling like black-uniformed leaves, they enter enemy territory, where Kosuke encounters a doll-faced, but serious-looking girl  playing a Korean folk song, ""Imjin River,"" on a flute. He and Yoshio are also nearly lynched by her older brother Lee Ang Son  and his gang, but he is already smitten -- and eager to learn that haunting tune. The story concentrates on Kosuke's struggle to not only master a song, but win the love of a girl who seems to live in an alien, hostile world. Meanwhile, Ang Son and his crew are street-fighting with Japanese toughs as if playing a contact sport, with one side scoring hits, then the other. He is macho to a fault, but when he learns that his sweet-heart  is pregnant and determined to keep the baby, he faces a choice that makes him quail: grow up or cop out."

On their twentieth day, after hearing a speech of his father about the importance of gratitude, they are attacked by a group of bandits. Karim's life is saved by Rao Rama, a holy man who hides Karim in a shallow grave. A massacre is caused, but Karim is unnoticed and, unlike his father, survives the tragedy. He is left with his highly valuable diamond. Karim next journeys to Bombay, where he attempts to sell the diamond in in a jewelry store. Feeling that they aren't offering him enough money, he leaves. The corrupt store owners, hoping to someway make profit, run out of the store and claim that Karim is a thief. He is taken in arrest and, unable to prove he is the true owner of his father's diamond, faces a long prison sentence. William Darsay, an American witness, saves him by revealing the truth and Karim is released. Some time later, Karim becomes one of the wealthiest men of Bombay, attending many high society social functions. At a polo match, he meets Janice Darsey, an attractive young American woman accompanied by her aunt and Dr. Wallace. Feeling attracted to each other, they are soon romanced. This is much to Mrs. Darsey's dislike, who doesn't approve her niece dating an Indian man. She attempts to sabotage their relationship by announcing that they will leave for Kolkota. Janice, however, does not want to leave Karim and runs away from her aunt to secretly accompany Karim on a tiger hunt. When her aunt finds out, she is infuriated and immediately calls for William, who happens to be Janice's brother. During the hunt, Karim notices his father's killer. Upon confronting him, the murderer starts a shooting. Janice starts to hide and stumbles upon a poisonous plant. Karim brings her to safety and removes the poison, after which they become engaged. Back at home, William and Mrs. Darsey try to stop the marriage by telling them lies, but Karim and Janice come to the conclusion that their love for each other is stronger.

They married in 1918, and after his return from World War I, the two set out to build a life together. While Lois worked as a nurse, Bill struggled to find his niche. Lois believed that Bill was destined for greatness, and despite his increasing reliance on alcohol, she showered him with love and support. Eventually, Lois persuaded a friend’s husband to hire Bill at his financial firm. By 1927, Bill was working on Wall Street and the couple was living a luxurious lifestyle. But despite Lois’s valiant efforts to control his drinking, Bill’s addiction to alcohol spiraled out-of-control. Soon his job, their lifestyle and their dreams were all gone. In 1935, after years of struggling to cover for Bill and trying desperately to manage his disease by herself, Lois finally saw him get and stay sober – not through her help, but from the support of a fellow alcoholic, Dr. Bob Smith. As Bill and Bob attained lasting sobriety and co-founded Alcoholics Anonymous, Lois began to feel neglected. Bill got and stayed sober without her help, and she felt isolated and resentful. Lois soon discovered she was not alone in her isolation and anger, and that there was a vast number of people whose lives and relationships had been devastated because a loved one was an alcoholic or drug addict. To help herself, and others like her, she co-founded Al-Anon in 1951.

His father gathers concealed documents before Peter's parents take him to stay with his Aunt May and Uncle Ben. His parents leave, but are later killed in a plane crash. As a teenager, Peter is a student at Midtown Science High School, where he is bullied by Flash Thompson, and is romantically interested in the beautiful Gwen Stacy, the daughter of police captain George Stacy. At home, Peter discovers his father's documents, and learns he had been working with scientist Dr. Curt Connors at Oscorp to combine human and animal DNA to cure illnesses. Peter sneaks into Oscorp to meet Connors, who is pressured by his superior Dr. Ratha to complete his serum, and cure the terminally ill head of Oscorp Norman Osborn. Connors wants the cure himself to restore his missing arm. Meanwhile, Peter breaks into a lab where a ""biocable""-a high strength strand of webbing-is created by genetically modified spiders, one of which bites him. During a subway ride home, a fight reveals that he has developed superhuman speed, strength, the ability to stick to surfaces, and a heightened sense of danger. Peter finds an algorithm in his father's documents and gives it to Connors−the missing key to his serum. In school, Peter damages school property during a confrontation with Flash and Ben is forced to work late so that he can pick up Peter. Ben tells Peter to escort May home that night. Peter ignores Ben in favor of helping Connors test their serum on a three-legged mouse. After he returns home, Peter fights with Ben about not picking up May, and Peter leaves. At a grocery store, the clerk rudely refuses to let Peter buy a drink, and when a thief steals money from the till, Peter lets the thief escape. Ben, searching the streets for Peter, confronts the thief, but is shot and killed. Peter responds to the gunshot and finds Ben's body. After seeing a police sketch of the suspect, Peter realizes it was the thief he let go. Peter hunts the killer, taking out other criminals as a result and attracting police attention for his vigilante actions. During one confrontation he falls into an abandoned gym, where a luchador-wrestling poster inspires him to create a mask to hide his identity. He creates a costume for himself with a spandex suit, and builds wrist-mounted mechanical devices that shoot biocable strands. Peter later reveals he is the vigilante to Gwen and they kiss. Seeing that the test mouse has regrown its missing limb using lizard DNA, Ratha demands human trials begin immediately. Connors refuses to risk innocent lives and is fired. Desperate, Connors tests the serum on himself and his missing arm regenerates. He learns that Ratha is going to test the serum on human subjects and goes to stop him, but his body begins to mutate. By the time he finds Ratha on the Williamsburg Bridge Connors has transformed into a large Lizard creature, tossing cars, including Ratha's, over the side of the bridge. Peter, now calling himself Spider-Man, manages to save Ratha and other civilians. Connors retreats into the sewer and reverts to human form. Peter later meets Connors in his office and suspects he is the Lizard, and later unsuccessfully confronts Connors' Lizard form in the sewers, leaving behind his camera. Connors learns Peter's identity via the name on the camera and pursues him to Midtown Science High School where they fight. In response, the police start a manhunt for both Spider-Man and Lizard. Connors heads to Oscorp, intending to disperse his serum across the city and make everyone into lizards, while Gwen develops an antidote in Oscorp's lab. The police corner Spider-Man and Captain Stacy discovers that he is Peter, but lets him escape to go save Gwen. Spider-Man manages to replace Connors' serum with the antidote, reverting Connors to human form, but not before Connors mortally wounds Captain Stacy. Before his death, Captain Stacy makes Peter promise to stay away from Gwen for her safety. He initially keeps the promise, but later admits that failed promises are the best kind. In a post-credits scene, an imprisoned Connors is confronted by an unseen man who asks if Connors told Peter the truth about his father. He replies, ""No"", and demands Peter be left alone before the man disappears.{{ref}}"

He has been having strange dreams. He is going to college with his best friend, Stella, whom he has known since junior high. Smith finds a note saying that he is the ""chosen son"". He has a roommate, Thor, whom he lusts after, regretting that Thor is straight. Stella goes to a party with Smith, but hooks up with another girl, Lorelei. He recognizes Lorelei as one of the people in his dream. Smith notices a guy, but he is distracted when a red-haired girl from his dream vomits on his shoe. The guy vanishes, but Smith gets picked up by London, a British student. They have sex, but to Smith's regret she does not want to be with him except during the sex. Smith visits a nude beach, and meets a man named Hunter. They start to have sex, but Smith is disappointed to hear that Hunter is married. Stella discovers that Lorelei is not only insatiable, but also a witch with rejection issues. Stella keeps trying to dump her, but has difficulty as the witch takes over Smith's body, and later tries to strangle her in the washroom. Stella saves herself by spraying water on the witch, causing her to burn up. During this time, Smith continues to dream about the red-haired girl. In his dreams, they are both pursued by people wearing animal masks. Smith finds out that the girl was killed, and her head was cut off. He later meets her twin sister, who says that she was kidnapped many years ago by men wearing animal masks. He also meets the guy from the earlier party, and learns his name is Oliver. He is gay and wants to go on a date with Smith. Smith walks in on Thor and his best friend Rex wrestling in their underwear. Though they are calling each other gay, Stella explains that only straight guys can get away with that. London seduces Rex and convinces him to have a three-way with Smith for his 19th birthday. The animal-masked people finally capture Smith, London, and Smith's mom. They are bundled into a van to be driven to meet the head of a secret cult. Smith finds out that it is his father , and London is his half-sister. Meanwhile, Stella, Oliver, and the perpetually stoned ""Messiah"" hook up to pursue the van. Oliver has powers like Lorelei's, but uses them for good. It turns out that meeting Oliver wasn't chance. He was looking for Smith to protect him. The Messiah was only acting stoned. He's also there to protect Smith. The animal-masked people turn out to be Thor, Rex, and Hunter. They must get London and Smith to a secret underground shelter to survive the explosion of dozens of nuclear bombs. Anyone not in the cult will be annihilated, and the cult will take over the world with Smith as its leader. The Messiah tries to run the van off the road, and both vehicles scream towards a bridge that is out. Smith's father presses a button and the whole Earth explodes, including the cult's underground shelter."

His wife quickly stops him, and when she goes out , he tries again, only to stop after the mouse calls him ""Daddy"". Sylvester's attitude changes entirely from this point on, and he takes him for a walk. Unfortunately, the neighborhood cats are not so enamored of the mouse, and he is forced to run back into the house. Several cats try to steal the mouse, using babysitter, salesman  and Santa disguises, cutting holes in the floor, etc., only to be foiled by Sylvester, who for once, is on the winning end of the same traps that he usually ends up getting foiled by.

As each of them were about to cross paths outside a sushi restaurant, nearby WOOHP agents  purposely cause the giant sushi roll above the entrance to break off and chase after them. The three girls are able to avoid it, save the life of a small pig  and destroy the sushi roll before it causes any damage. After that, Alex, Sam and Clover introduce themselves and this starts their friendship when they later see each other again at their new school, meet the current principal Miss Skrich and their future rival Mandy. Clover offers her new friends a change of clothes after Mandy sprays them with a chai machine, but they find themselves sucked in through a locker and into one of the offices of WOOHP. It's there that they meet Jerry and fellow WOOHP agent Tad. Jerry reveals that WOOHP had been observing the three of them secretly since childhood, showing videos of each girl, and picking them as prime recruits for the organization. However, the girls are quick to reject the invite and refuse to join. However, they later are ""forced"" into training after each having traumatic experiences that seemingly relate to WOOHP. They agree to go through training and in 48 hours, complete the training. After training, they are thrown into their first mission when famous celebrities, like rockstar Rob Hearthrob and animal psychologist Peppy Wolfman, have been mysteriously abducted. This also shows how the girls obtained their differently colored uniforms . They later find that each went through a make over by a mysterious machine called the ""Fabulizor"", discovered thanks to security footage in Wolfman's office. They later see that everyone at school also had gone through the Fabulizor, having the same look the next day. This is after nearly being blasted by one of Fabu's minions in a fighter jet while being flown back to school and after nearly avoiding Miss Skritch as they sneak back into school. Tailing Mandy that night, they find that all of those who went through the Fabulizor became hypnotized by a special chip in their cheek bones prior to the make over and were abducted to a strange space station out in space. They then meet the mastermind behind the entire affair, Fabu, a runway model who quickly lost fame in five minutes on the runway and was ashamed of not being a part of the crowd during his childhood. The spies accidentally expose themselves and are captured by Fabu's strongest henchmen. He then relates his entire plan, to abduct everyone who went through the Fabulizor and place them inside a special space station which he calls Fabutopia to live out new lives in the posh surroundings, then use a missile to destroy all of Earth, before using his Fabulizor in reverse and give the girls each horrible make overs . He then sets them to be blasted back to Earth in rockets. But just as he leaves, things get more difficult when Tad meets the girls again while they are still imprisoned and says he will let them fail the mission and stop Fabu himself, taking all the credit and regaining his ""favorite agent"" status with Jerry. But after a fight with Fabu, Tad is strapped to the missile bound for Earth. The girls manage to escape and, after fixing the Fabulizor's damage to themselves, go after Fabu. They are unable to stop the missile from taking off but hitch a ride as it is rocketing towards Earth with Tad still attached to it. They are able to turn the missile around to destroy the station, surprising the girls since they had no idea of how to stop it earlier and Alex whacks at the control panel with the WOOHP manual. They then are picked up by a surprise appearance from Jerry in one of WOOHP's ships and rescue the kidnapped people from aboard the station  and evacuate safely before the missile explodes and destroys the station in a firework finale. They then chase after Fabu's ship, manage to destroy it and catch Fabu in his escape pod. After the mission, Clover is offered a date by Rob Hearthrob and Alex is invited for a session with Wolfman over the phone. But before that, they later return to school to face punishment from the principal for the ""damage"" they caused when trying to avoid her earlier on in the movie . But fortunately, it seems that thanks to WOOHP, they have a new principal, whose name is not revealed, and seemingly does not know about the girls' punishment and gives Sam high praise. Miss Skritch had been transferred to another school in Siberia in an igloo, Fabu, his henchmen and Tad are later imprisoned and set for punishment by WOOHP and everyone who was rescued from aboard Fabu's space station have their minds erased . But just after the girls celebrate getting even with Mandy for the last time, courtesy of one of WOOHP's gadgets, they are sucked away to another mission. The girls are quick to bring up personal appointments, but soon find themselves running from a WOOHP jet as it prepares to suck them aboard. But the girls are ready for their mission as they change into their spy uniforms and exclaim their friendship as the movie ends."

He also has a strange obsession with carrying a camera everywhere he goes, constantly filming his surroundings. On a holiday in France, he discovers his cousin is Invader, an internationally known street artist. Thierry finds this fascinating, and accompanies Invader and his friends, including the artists Monsieur André and Zevs on their nocturnal adventures, documenting their activities. A few months later, Invader visits Thierry in LA, and arranges a meeting with Shepard Fairey. Thierry continues filming Fairey's activities even after Invader has returned home to France. While Fairey is confused by Thierry's enthusiasm, Thierry states that he wishes to make a complete documentary about street art, and the two cross the nation, shooting other artists at work, including Seizer, Neck Face, Sweet Toof, Cyclops, Ron English, Dotmasters, Swoon, Azil, Borf and Buffmonster. What Guetta fails to tell Fairey is that he has no plan to compile his footage into an actual film, and indeed never looks at his footage. Guetta continues to hear more about Banksy – a prominent and particularly secretive artist. His attempts to contact Banksy meet with failure, until one day Banksy visits LA without his usual accomplice, who is refused entry to the US. Stuck in LA without a guide, Banksy contacts Fairey, who calls Guetta. Guetta becomes Banksy's guide in LA, later following him back to England, winning the privilege to film Banksy on his home turf – a feat that confuses Banksy's crew. Banksy, however, sees the opportunity to document street art, which he recognizes as having a ""short life span"", and after Guetta aids him in recording both production, deployment and crowd reactions to his ""Murdered Phone-box"" piece, asks him to film the preparations for his ""Barely Legal"" show. The two become friends, as Guetta provides Banksy with some relief from his anonymity. Returning to LA, Guetta becomes bored, and eventually ends up producing his own stickers and decals and putting them up in the city. Banksy's show is being prepared in Skid Row, Los Angeles, and while in LA, Banksy has the idea of deploying a Guantanamo Bay detainee doll in Disneyland. He visits the location and places the doll while Guetta films. A short while later, however, the rides stop, and the park's security catch Guetta, who is taken to an interrogation room, while Banksy switches clothes and blends into the crowd. During interrogation, Guetta refuses to admit any wrongdoing, and when allowed a phone call, covertly alerts Banksy to his situation. When confronted by security personnel, he destroys the evidence in his stills camera, but stashes the videotape in his sock and is eventually let go, much to the amazement of Banksy who then says he trusts him implicitly because of the incident. A few days later, ""Barely Legal"" opens, and becomes an overnight mainstream success. Street art prices begin to rocket in auction houses. Banksy is both surprised and disillusioned by the sudden hype surrounding street art, and urges Guetta to finish his supposed documentary. Guetta begins to edit together the several thousand hours of footage, and produces a film titled Life Remote Control. The result is 90&nbsp;minutes of distorted fast cutting about seemingly random themes. Banksy questions Guetta's ability as a filmmaker, deeming his product ""unwatchable"", but realizes the street art footage itself is valuable. Banksy decides to have a shot at producing a film himself. To make sure that Guetta remains occupied, Banksy suggests he make his own art show. {{Quote box}} Guetta happily accepts the assignment, adopting the name ""Mr. Brainwash"", putting up street art in the city and six months later, re-mortgaging his business to afford renting copious equipment and a complete production team to create pieces of art under his supervision. He rents a former CBS studio to prepare his first show, ""Life Is Beautiful"", and scales up his production to something much larger than Banksy suggested, but with little focus. When Guetta breaks his foot after falling off a ladder, Banksy realises that the show may well become a trainwreck, and sends a few professionals to help Guetta out. While the producers take care of the practical side of the show, Guetta spends his time on more publicity, asking support from both Fairey and Banksy, eventually taping up huge billboards with their quotes, and ultimately ending up on the cover of L. A. Weekly. Preparation is seriously behind schedule, and Guetta's production team insists that he must make decisions &mdash; yet Guetta spends his time hyping up and marketing his work for tens of thousands of dollars. Eight hours before the opening, paintings are still missing from the walls, and since Guetta is busy giving interviews, the eventual layout of the show is decided by the crew itself. Despite all this, however, the show becomes a raging success with the crowd, and after the first week of the show, Guetta sells almost a million dollars worth of art, with his pieces showing in galleries all around the world, to the utter confusion of both Fairey and Banksy. In an ending montage, Guetta insists that time will tell whether he is a real artist or not."

Clélia's mother once dated MacRoi years ago while working as a caberet singer. Once she became pregnant with Clélia, she stopped seeing MacRoi and married Clélia's father. Accompanying her daughter to Paris, she tells Clélia that her strongest principle was honour, and encourages her to get married and settle down. In Paris Clélia gives a television interview and talks about her two successful books of photography: a ""study of absence"" showing empty streets and deserted landscapes, and a study of fashion models without showing their faces. While walking the Paris streets taking photographs, Clélia meets Clève , a bumbling middle-aged children's book publisher who is preparing to marry MacRoi's wealthy daughter to bolster his flagging publishing house. Clève is immediately attracted to Clélia and invites her back to his office where they make love. Afterwards, she meets Clève's brother Bernard, a Catholic bishop, and their father. At the La Verite offices, Clélia finds most of her co-workers to be disillusioned and perverse—all knowing that they ""earn their keep on dirt."" At her first assignment covering a hockey team that MacRoi recently purchased, Clélia finds herself in the team's locker room surrounded by naked players celebrating their victory. MacRoi is there and after teasing her about her taking photos of the naked players asks if she'll join his family for a dinner party. Before she leaves, Clélia has sex with one of the players. At MacRoi's dinner party, Clève loudly declares his love for Clélia before his entire family, including his fiance, Genièvre MacRoi, the sister of Rupert MacRoi. Genièvre responds by calling off their wedding and hitting him. Later that evening, following MacRoi's announcement of the purchase of Clève's publishing company, Clève's father collapses and dies while his son and Clélia look on. Clève asks Clélia never to leave him. At the funeral, Clève confides in Clélia his fears that MacRoi will not respect his family's publishing house now that he owns it, saying, ""He massacres all that is upright and inneficient, delicate and noble."" Soon after, Clélia and her mother move into Clève's house. He gives her his mother's engagement ring. In bed she reads lines from a W. H. Auden poem, ""This like a dream keeps other time, and daytime is the loss of this, for time is inches and the heart's changes, where ghost has haunted lost and wanted. But this was never a ghost's endeavor, nor finished this, was ghost at ease, and till it pass love shall not near the sweetness here nor sorrow take his endless look."" Clélia's first portfolio of photos for La Verite creates a sensation and she is congratulated by her colleagues—all except Némo , a sexy young photographer who promptly propositions her upon their first encounter. In spite of her sexual attraction to Némo, Clélia marries Clève in a ceremony marred somewhat by the presence of La Verite photographers and reporters, including Némo. After the wedding, Némo leaves his girlfriend, Ina , a former African princess and Parisian prostitute whom he met investigating the illegal organ trade. He delivers his wedding photos to Clélia's home, handing them to her mother. Upset at the intrusion, and suspecting her daughter is having an affair, Clélia's mother collapses and soon dies. Némo continues to follow Clélia, even taking photos of her in her house making love to her husband. Later she learns that Némo was given this assignment by MacRoi who is looking to find dirt on Clève. Although she continues to see Némo, Clélia resolutely keeps to her wedding vows in the face of her suitor's continued advances. She travels by train to Normandy to attend a motorcycle event in which Némo is a participant. During the race Némo crashes, and Clélia rushes to his side, revealing her feelings for him. At the celebration afterwards, Némo gets drunk and loud, talking about his investigation into the illegal organ trade and the shady International characters involved. Later that night he and Clélia take the train back to Paris together. After Némo is attacked by a gang hired by the illegal organ traffickers, Clélia asks him to show her the world he is investigating—a dark world of brutal human fighting to the death. Throughout their time together, Némo continues his advances toward her, but Clélia resists. When she returns to her home, Clève is convinced she is having an affair, despite her promises that she's never lied to him and will never be unfaithful to him. After learning that his brother the bishop has run off with a married woman, Clève says he will join his brother in Plougastel-Daoulas in Brittany at The Happy Inn. After they make love Clève writes on the bathroom mirror, ""Oh but what worm am I the victim of that you then unabashed did what I never wished confessed another love and I submissive, felt unwanted and went out?"" After he leaves, Clélia calls the offices of La Verite to inform them of Bishop Bernard's ""love-nest"" in Brittany, and soon the scandal erupts in the news. Clélia watches the television coverage of his public humiliation. Clève does not return to his wife, and after sleeping with a transvestite prostitute, he calls La Verite asking that they track his wife who he believes is two-timing him. Meanwhile, Clélia comes to Némo's house, where assassins hired by the organ traffickers blast the place with gunfire, but Némo and Clélia are able to defend themselves and escape. Soon after, Clélia attends a publicity session with MacRoi and a new partner. MacRoi presents Némo with a new expensive motorcycle for his work covering Clélia. During the session, assassins again attempt to kill Némo, and during the attack both Némo and Clève are injured. MacRoi is killed by a shard of glass in his eye. After the funeral, MacRoi's daughter reorganizes the company, intending to continue the scandal-mongering. She also fires Clélia, who later begs her husband to come back to her, but he will not reconsider. On their way out of the building he falls down a flight of steps and dies on the way to the hospital, with Clélia at his side. At the funeral she avoids Némo's advances and leaves Paris. Sometime later, Némo is interviewed on television and talks about his new portfolio dedicated to Clélia, who has disappeared. A few years later, while taking photographs in a monastery, Clélia by chance sees the beginning of an English-language MacRoi Production film called The Princess of Cleve about her life, directed by Némo. She laughs at the absurdity. Before leaving the monastery, she places her wedding rings on a tree branch, while the ghost of her late husband looks on. Clélia can only say, ""Forgive me."" He smiles and retrieves the rings while she weeps."

As Al rubs on the lamp, a genie - the very one from Aladdin's tale - suddenly appears before him and proclaims him his new master. After recovering from his first shock, Al begins to use the genie's power to fulfill some of his most eager wishes: beating up a bully and his gang, winning the affection of Patricia, his long-time crush, and riding in a real Rolls Royce, something his late father had always dreamed of. More importantly, Al begins to view the Genie as a friend and asks him only for his most fondest wishes without overindulging himself.

Her in laws later found out that her family had fallen from grace and is now financially deprived. The devious in-laws then plotted a scheme to abuse her till she runs away from home so they could find a real rich bride for their son. Their most devious scheme involved setting up the unfortunate bride with the manservant to look like she was being unfaithful to him. Her oblivious husband believed this ploy and disgraced her. Heartbroken and betrayed: the young woman was ostracized and overheard her in laws discussing their next scheme to drive her away from home. Out of a fit of rage - she threatened to tell her husband and ran away from the house only to be caught by her uncle in-law. They imprisoned her and beat her up. She almost made a successful escape when her father in-law broke a bottle and stabbed her with it. Bloodied and weak, she managed to get to her favourite doll and had her soul transferred in the doll upon dying. Her in-laws covered the murder by burning her in the Hindu ceremonial fire, lit by her own husband unbeknownst to him. The groom married another bride and she is a very lovely person. Her husband is still mourning the death of his first wife - whom he had loved dearly - hence was emotionally distant to his new wife. Meanwhile, the soul of his deceased first wife had been residing in the said doll, waiting for her vengeance. The ghost of his first wife managed to kill her in laws one by one in a gruesome way, often taunting before she finishes them off. She then became a little to angry and plans to kill her husband for being oblivious to the mistreatment of her in laws and the new wife who took her place. The new wife suspected that something was wrong with the doll in the storeroom and tried to explain to her new husband but was brushed off. When the doll finally made her move to kill the new wife, she pleaded not to kill her and her husband but was cut off by the ghost doll, lamenting how she was unjustly treated and wants her justice. The new wife explained that although her anger was rational, her vengeance against her and the husband was unfounded. The ghost doll challenged the new wife for a game of cat and mouse and eventually, the new wife wins after killing the ghost doll with Lord Murugan's Sceptre. This film was filmed in the village of Valivalam in Thiruvarur district, Tamil Nadu, India. It is inspired from an Hollywood movie called Child's Play.

They make attempt after attempt to flee from the drudgery and boredom in dreary India to the land of the free and the home of the brave - the United States. They remain undeterred by their failure and woeful incompetence to get there - be it by acquiring a visa or a wife, or smuggling themselves into boats. Their hopes flag, but never quite fade away. What is funny about the film is that it strikes a nerve. It is a comic illustration of an aspiration that is latent within many, if not all, of us. It is a portrayal of an obsessive fascination for the other, the conviction that the astroturf is greener on the other side, that comes through. This is an ironical reflection of the same sentiment that is in a film like Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, in which the gloss and glitz is nothing if not Yankee. The film ends with some wisdom gained, but not too much to stop being human. Deven Bhojani's portrayal of the cute Gujju-turned-mod is by far the highlight of the film. It is wonderful to see his talents reined in well by Jha, and hence being used to the full, unlike a lot of the work he does, or is probably asked to do, on television. Aside from that, it is the little moments, like putting desi cigarettes in a pack of Marlboros, that lend the film a charm of its own. It is encouraging to see that such alternative films are being made, with the express purpose of entertainment, while remaining entirely independent of any pretensions to art cinema.

They strike up a conversation and the elderly man reveals that he himself had a career in the circus business. Jacob  reveals that he was present during one of the most infamous circus disasters of all time and the circus owner asks him to share his story. Most of the film then takes place in a flashback to the era of the Great Depression. Twenty-three-year-old Polish American Jacob  is a Cornell veterinary medicine student on the brink of a promising career as a veterinarian. Unfortunately, during his very last final exam, he is interrupted and informed that his parents were killed in a car crash. His father  has left huge debts, and the bank was foreclosing on Jacob's home. Feeling there is no point in returning to school, and having no home to go home to, he jumps onto a passing train where he meets Camel ([[Jim Norton . In the morning, Jacob discovers that he jumped on the Benzini Brothers Circus train. He sees a beautiful woman, Marlena  and meets August , the circus owner, head animal trainer, and Marlena's husband. Jacob reveals he studied veterinary science and has noticed a problem with Silver, the star horse in the show. August agrees to hire Jacob as a vet for the circus animals after Jacob tells August that Silver has laminitis, is in terrible pain and will soon be unable to walk, never mind perform. August instructs Jacob to ""fix"" Silver and keep him performing as long as possible. But Jacob cannot bear to see Silver's suffering and takes it upon himself to put Silver down. August is furious with Jacob's decision to euthanize Silver against orders. To show Jacob who is boss, he threatens to throw him from the moving train - telling him that an animal's suffering is nothing compared to a man's, and that Jacob must carry out all of August's future orders if he wishes to keep his job. August eventually procures Rosie the elephant as Silver's replacement. He is initially thrilled and invites Jacob to his car for dinner and cocktails with him and Marlena. Jacob &mdash; clearly attracted to Marlena &mdash; watches uncomfortably as the married couple flirt and dance in front of him, but later in the evening becomes clear that their relationship is complicated. August is possessive, jealous and sometimes rough with Marlena. In the next few weeks, August becomes frustrated when Rosie the elephant seems impossible to train. August is brutal with Rosie, beating her when she fails to follow orders. After one such beating, Jacob realizes that the elephant was trained in Polish and only understands Polish commands. After that, Rosie performs beautifully and the circus enjoys a short period of success. While working closely together to train Rosie, Jacob and Marlena fall in love. After August discovers this, he cruelly taunts both Marlena and Jacob. Later that night, Marlena discovers that August plans to throw Jacob from the train and they run away together. Hiding in a local hotel, they are ambushed by August's henchmen who drag Marlena away and beat up Jacob. Jacob returns to the circus to find Marlena. After Marlena finds Jacob she tells him that his friends Walter  and Camel were thrown from the train and killed. Several circus employees have become fed up with August's murderous cruelty and unleash their revenge by unlocking all the animals' cages while the big top tent is jam-packed with an audience enjoying Marlena and Rosie's performance. Jacob attempts to find Marlena in the chaos and August attacks him. When Marlena tries to stop August from beating Jacob, he turns his fury on her and attempts to choke her, while one of August's henchmen continues beating Jacob. Two circus workers save Jacob just in time. Lying on the ground, bloodied and beaten, he looks up and sees Rosie hit August on the back of the head with a metal spike. Back in the present, Jacob explains what happened afterward: he returned to Cornell, took his last exam, and finished his degree. He and Marlena took several of the horses and Rosie and got jobs with Ringling Brothers – he as a vet and she continuing to perform with the animals. They married and had five children and kept Rosie until her death many years later. Eventually, he took a job as a vet at the Albany Zoo and Marlena died peacefully in her bed at an old age. He convinces the circus owner to whom he is telling his story to hire him in the ticket booth. The circus owner agrees and Jacob states that he has finally come home."

In the ensuing chaos, Alan is forced to drink vampire blood, which will make him a half-vampire. Five years later in San Cazador, California, Edgar is facing eviction from his trailer and tries to raise funds by selling his collection of old comic books to his friend Zoe, who works at a local comics shop. While there, a famous blogger named Johnny Trash enters; Zoe explains that Johnny is there for a rave that's going on in the town. Back at his trailer, Edgar is approached by Gwen Lieber, a writer of romantic vampire novels, whose brother Peter was kidnapped during a rave in Ibiza, Spain, and she suspects vampiric activity. She gives him a vial of a drug called ""The Thirst"" which is given to people at raves hosted by a person known as ""DJ X""; he determines that it is vampire blood. Gwen offers him a large sum of money to rescue her brother, but he turns it down. DJ X and his associates are transporting Peter - bound and drugged - in a small plane. DJ X and three others jump from the plane in flight, landing safely to meet Johnny Trash for a live interview. DJ X kills Johnny afterward, since the blogger had served his purpose in promoting the rave online. Edgar visits Alan, who is now half-vampire and satisfies his thirst for blood by feeding on animal blood acquired in his job as a taxidermist. Edgar tries to enlist Alan's aid in stopping DJ X from raising an army through his raves, but he refuses, having lost all hope that he can be saved and believing that the whole Alpha Vampire theory is just a ""neverending pyramid scheme"". Remembering his youthful days with Alan and Sam Emerson, Edgar resolves to take the job alone but Gwen introduces him to Lars Van Goetz, a former reality-TV star hoping to use the mission to make him famous again; Edgar reluctantly accepts his help. After a visit to Sam's grave , in which Edgar returns to Sam the Batman #14 that Sam had boasted having when they met, Edgar finds that Alan has left him a book of vampire history to help in his mission. Edgar gives the book to Zoe to research. She is attacked by a vampire, but she and Edgar defeat it, and she explains what she has learned about a ritual sacrifice during a Blood Moon, such as the one that will occur the night of the rave. Congressman Blake, now Edgar's weapons designer  outfits Edgar and Zoe for battle. After fighting off an attack on Blake's house, they meet up with Gwen, Lars, and Claus, and set off for the island where the rave is taking place. Leaving Gwen behind for her safety, the remaining four go inside in search of Peter. Lars finds him, but thinking that the whole thing is staged, leaves Peter to rescue him at a more dramatic time. As they fight various vampires, Lars gets killed, Edgar is injured, but rejoins Gwen, Claus, and Zoe in returning to the building. DJ X is distributing The Thirst to the crowd, and preparing to sacrifice Peter. Edgar takes on DJ X, and is narrowly saved by the timely arrival of Alan. The vampire hunters rally, and Edgar impales DJ X with a resin spike grenade  before he and Alan finish him off with swords through the heart. To their surprise, the death of DJ X doesn't cause the half-vampires to revert. They discover that Peter was the real alpha vampire , whose power DJ X was attempting to extract. Gwen's rescue mission was also a ruse to bring Edgar to Peter, who wanted him to become his personal vampire hit-man, to keep other vampires under control. Peter kills Gwen instead of turning her like she wanted and orders the other vampires to kill Edgar and the rest. Peter attempts to use his partial control over Alan against Edgar, but Edgar douses Peter with water which he simultaneously blesses into holy water, destroying Peter and returning the others to normal. Later, as Alan enjoys getting his first suntan in years, Zoe and Edgar reflect on their adventure. Edgar wonders about her knowledge that vampires were real, which she dismisses as ""a hunch"". Edgar comments about something he's just read about werewolves being able to transform at any time, and the audience is teased with the sight of her eyes becoming wolflike."

He finds that to the world around him – including his traveling partner Christina Warren  and the bathroom mirror – he appears to be Sean Fentress, a school teacher. As he comes to grips with this revelation, the train car explodes, killing everyone aboard. Stevens regains consciousness inside an unfamiliar cockpit. Through a screen, Air Force Captain Colleen Goodwin  verifies Stevens's identity. She explains Stevens is in the ""Source Code"", an experimental device created by scientist Dr. Rutledge ([[Jeffrey Wright . The Code allows its user to experience the last eight minutes of another compatible person's life within an alternate timeline.It is stated that eight minutes is the length of short-term memory, and that one of the bombing's victims had neural pathways similar enough to Stevens's to allow Source Code to take advantage of a quantum effect reminiscent of a light bulb being switched off, allowing this period to be retroactively accessed for some time after the death and alternate histories explored. It is believed that these alternate histories are not ""real"" and cease after the eight minutes; they can be used only to gain information. Stevens's mission is to use Source Code to discover the location of a bomb aboard the train and identify the bomber who detonated it. Goodwin explains that the train explosion occurred that morning, and was a warning by the bomber as a precursor to a larger dirty bomb that will be detonated in downtown Chicago. Stevens is unwillingly sent back into the Source Code to try again. Stevens is sent back into the Source Code several times, trying different approaches each time including trying to warn the authorities on the train and trying to flee with Christina. None of these attempts are successful and in each case he is returned to the Source Code to try again. During one of Stevens's attempts, he learns that the train explosion occurred two months after an incident in Afghanistan which reportedly killed him. Once he discovers this, he demands more information from Goodwin. She explains that the remains of his body are in fact on life-support at the Source Code facility while his mind is hooked up to a computer system, the cockpit being a mental projection of his own mind to cope with the experience. Angered to discover this, Stevens requests that his life support be terminated after the mission is completed, to which Dr. Rutledge agrees. Stevens eventually identifies both the bomber, a young man, Derek Frost , and the rented white van that he will use to carry the bomb into the center of Chicago. On his return, Stevens's information is successfully used by the military to capture Frost before he can trigger the bomb. Stevens is praised as a hero, but in private, Rutledge tells Goodwin to renege on the deal, and instead to wipe Stevens's memory so he can be used the next time there is such an incident. Stevens learns that the promise to him has been violated, and convinces Goodwin to let him return to Source Code once more, after which she will disable his life support, against Rutledge's orders. Once back aboard the train, Stevens disarms the bomb, subdues Frost, and handcuffs him to a railing. Stevens calls the authorities to identify Frost and inform them of the location of the dirty bomb. He then calls his estranged father under the guise of a fellow soldier, mending the emotional distance between them. He challenges an embittered comic  to perform a stand-up routine on the train, causing laughter throughout the entire train car, and then takes Christina aside. Asking her what she would do if she knew that she only had seconds left to live, Stevens begins to kiss her as his last seconds run out. As promised, at this exact moment, Goodwin disables his life-support and the scene reveals his actual, physical body as severely mutilated and comatose. Time freezes, but Stevens is surprised to find himself finishing the kiss, still aboard the train with Christina. He realizes that he will remain in the alternate timeline of the un-bombed train. The train arrives safely in Chicago, and he and Christina walk together and discuss their future. Later that morning, Goodwin arrives for work at Nellis Air Force Base and receives a text that Stevens had sent earlier, just as news breaks of the failed bombing attempt in Chicago. The text explains that the Source Code effectively allows the user to change history within alternate timelines. Stevens' text ends with him proposing to Goodwin that when his alternate self in this timeline is used in a future Source Code mission, Goodwin should help him, and tell him that ""everything is gonna be okay."""

They meet the owner, Whirlen Merlin, along with his brother Marlen, who acts as cook and butler, and Crystal, Whirlen's former stage assistant. Fred is smitten, to Daphne's irritation. The gang learns that a giant gryphon has been scaring away the students and staff. After dinner, Velma, Daphne, and Fred are talking in the hall, when Daphne comments on his attraction to Crystal. Fred explains that she is so graceful, then he and Velma make fun of Daphne's kultziness. Later that evening, Madelyn, who has had a crush on Shaggy for years, takes him on a romantic walk to in the gardens and show him an ancient sun-dia. Madelyn explains that the gryphon was meant to protect the school, but then the gryphon chases them from the garden. A student takes a picture of the gryphon, which appears on the morning newspaper. The rest of the students leave, so the gang starts taking classes themselves. Meanwhile, Calvin Curdles, a powerful vegetable ice-cream guru, continually offers to buy Whirlen's castle from him. The gang promises to investigate to see if Curdles is behind the Gryphon, so he tells Amos to call if he hears anything new. Velma finds Daphne practicing ballet so she can be more graceful and capture Fred's attention.. The two then stumble on a secret passageway leading to the attic of the school, where they discover  that Alma Rumblebuns, the school's head maid, used to date Calvin Curdles.

Amos calls Curdles to the castle while the gang goes after Madelyn, Calvin Curdles tries to convince Whirlen to sign over the castle. Whirlen almost does but the gang suggests that they wait before the deal is signed, still believing that Curdles is behind the entire thing. They get into the tower with the spear, which is a key, and they rescue Madelyn. Everybody rushes outside including Curdles. The gryphon crashes to the ground, where they discover that it is a giant puppet, controlled from a blimp hidden by a fog machine run by Whirlen's brother Marlin. He had discovered that Lord O'Flannery had devises hidden in the Gryphon's Roost, hoping it would make everyone think a monster lived there. Marlin used the devices to scare trespassers away. He was also behind the banshee, which was only a hologram.

Rare wood called ""Jobi wood"" has arrived from Hiro's homeland to be used in completing the Center. All of the engines are excited about this and want to help deliver the wood to the Search and Rescue Center. Diesel is determined to show how useful he is, so he decides to take the Jobi Wood to the Search and Rescue Center himself and races down the line with it. Thomas notices that Diesel is going too fast and chases after him. Diesel ends up dangling from an unfinished bridge. The Jobi wood ends up falling off the unfinished bridge into the river below. Diesel is rescued by Thomas, but now, there's no wood to build the Search and Rescue Center. For his heroic rescue, Thomas is given the job of heading to the mainland to find more Jobi Wood. He is told that there is no more room on the steam boat and that he must wait for the next boat, but Thomas notices a raft being dragged behind the boat and asks if he can be carried on the raft. Thomas says goodbye to the other engines at Brendam Docks and sets off across the sea to the mainland. That night, the coupling on the raft breaks and Thomas is left floating all alone at sea. The next day, Thomas gets stranded on a mysterious island known as Misty Island. Thomas decides to explore the island, which is filled with rickety tracks, secret hideouts, and old bridges.

The Logging Locos explain to Thomas that they were sent to the island after causing trouble on the mainland. Thomas also discovers that Jobi trees grow on Misty Island and there is logging equipment to load it for him. With help from his new friends, Thomas tries to find his way back to Sodor and uncovers more of the island's mysteries, including a tunnel connecting Misty Island with Sodor. Meanwhile, out at sea, Harold and Captain are searching for Thomas. Thomas decides to take the Logging Locos with him and haul a load of Jobi wood to Sodor by way of the tunnel. However, the tunnel collapses, trapping the engines. Thomas then tries the smoke signals that Salty had told him about. The smoke signals are spotted by Percy, and he gives the news to the Fat Controller, who sails with Edward, Gordon, and James to Misty Island in hopes of finding Thomas. Meanwhile, Percy and Whiff go through the tunnel eventually reaching the blockade. The two engines break through the blockade and find Thomas and his new friends. Percy, Whiff, Thomas, and the Logging Locos all return to Sodor. Thomas then sails back to Misty Island to find Edward, Gordon, James, and the Fat Controller. Once Thomas, the Fat Controller and the other engines are back on Sodor, Bash, Dash, and Ferdinand are all restored at the Sodor Steamworks. The Logging Locos help the other engines build the Search and Rescue Center. Soon the Search and Rescue Center opens and the Misty Island Tunnel is restored. In the final scene after the credits, Diesel 10 rolls up to the edge of a cliff, glares down at the engines laughing with their new friends at the Search and Rescue Center, and remarks that they will be laughing on the other sides of their boilers soon. This scene is a sneak preview of the next ""Thomas and Friends"" special, ""Day of the Diesels""."

As he looks around, something comes up from behind him, throwing him up into the air and back down again. The man screams as something begins eating him, and as the man dies, the camera turns to a pair of dog tags that are slowly overtaken by a small river of blood. John Hickman  and his girlfriend Brooks  are a pair of San Francisco residents who invite their friends, self-proclaimed tough guy and wannabe soldier Ben , his close friend Wayne ([[Rajiv Shah , as well as chef Quincy  and his dog Wolfgang, to a weekend of hunting, drinking and fun and camping near John's uncle's cabin, in a remote mountain area. Ben and Wayne can't stand Brooks, and the feeling is mutual-they spend much of the trip getting on each others' nerves. Enroute, they stop at a gas station/general store for directions and encounter a van of hippie women and their cult leader, the Hippie Stranger,  who live in a commune in the woods, presumably raising emus for meat. From the store owner, they learn about a local legend called ""The Ripper,"" a legendary killer hog which supposedly weighs several thousand pounds. After obtaining some supplies and directions, they make their way to the cabin and camp outside. The next morning, they encounter cocaine addicted hillbilly brothers Jake  and Ricky Tibbs,  cousins of John's, who are interested in joining them on a wild hog hunt. An old feud still exists between John and Ricky, who is a Gulf War veteran, showing signs of drug addiction and mental illness. His brother Jake appears to be the only person maintaining control and keeping Ricky from flying off the handle. Quincy, who is eager to get to know them, is obviously inexperienced in any sort of outdoor activities, and Ricky accuses Wolfgang of being a 'pet' not a 'dog' seeming equally oblivious to hunting as well. When Jake Tibbs sets up some targets to see how well the others can shoot, boastful Ben makes a fool of himself, not being able to hit the target even once, while Wayne hits it not more than a couple of times. Brooks outshoots both men, to their surprise and chagrin-she impresses Tibbs by hitting the target with every shot. As the group makes their trip through the woods, they encounter an area called the Big Wallow, and, using a piglet call as a lure, they manage to attract several pigs to their location. One of them rams into Wayne's leg at full charge giving him a compound fracture at thekneecap and incapacitating him. Wolfgang goes charging after the boars while Brooks shows off her marksmanship talents and kills one of them. Ricky calls Jake to come look at something disturbing he's observed while skinning and dressing the hog they killed. Though adult-sized, it has no protective armor over its shoulders-it is not a full grown animal as they had thought, but a piglet-a very, very big piglet. Just as everyone is beginning to wonder about the truth of the Ripper legend, Quincy reappears, very excited. While looking for his dog Wolfgang, he had encountered a large crop of marijuana plants and now leads the others to it, leaving Brooks with Wayne. A conflict emerges when John objects to Jake and Ricky taking the plants for profit, as they are growing on his property and he wants no part of it. There is also a strange and disturbing sign posted near the plants, which leads John to think that the hippies that he thought were raising emus are actually growing pot instead. During the ensuing argument, Ricky snaps, and holds John at bay with a crossbow. John and Jake Tibbs are trying to gain control of the situation, when Ben arrives on the scene,thinks Ricky is about to kill John, and shoots him. Jake flees to tell his clan, and the others return to Wayne and Brooks. Quincy and Ben start making their way back to the cabin while Brooks and John leave Wayne to find something to make a stretcher with so they can carry him out of there and get back to the cabin and their vehicle. Shortly after their departure, Wayne is attacked by something we don't see, and manages to fire off a single round. Brooks and John circle back and find him missing, as well as Ricky's body. Meanwhile, Ben and Quincy make their way back to the cabin. They find Wolfgang's mutilated body, and determine he was killed by the Tibbs clan. Ricky and Jake's clan make their appearance, Ben manages to kill his pursuer and escape, but Quincy is knocked out of the vehicle he was attempting to escape in, and is executed by a single gunshot to the back of the head. Meanwhile, John and Brooks run into the mysterious Hippie Stranger as they hide in the forest; he is carrying a cattle prod, and tells them that he is looking for an escaped animal, and that they can contact the police from his commune. He helps them beat off an attack by the murderous Tibbs clan, and several hillbillies are killed. In the meantime, Ben has found the commune, where he is given drugs by several beautiful hippie women, and led into an enormous, muddy pen. He encounters a dying Wayne, who says that something has been eating him. Ben turns in shock as something approaches him from behind, and screams. The remaining Tibbs clan members have reached the woods around the commune;they are stalked and killed, one by one, by the murderous hippie women-all except one man, who is seized by something else-something we don't see. Brooks and John arrive at the commune with the Hippie Stranger. When John questions why Ben's equipment is there, but not Ben himself, they force him into a cell while the leader takes Brooks out into the pen. At last, we are shown what has been attacking people throughout the movie-it is the legendary Ripper, who is carrying the remains of one of the redneck clan in his mouth. Meanwhile, Jake makes his way into the commune, and is confronted by some of the women. He shoots a couple of them, and forces one of the women to let him into John's cell. As Jake sees the Ripper out in the pen and freezes in shock, the hippie woman he brought with him attacks, stabbing him in the eye with her boar's tooth necklace before John kills her. Jake dies from his wounds while the Hippie Stranger prepares to sacrifice Brooks to the boar, whom he and his followers have for some bizarre reason been worshiping-and feeding unwary people to. Brooks gets a hold of the Stranger's cattle prod and pokes him with it, causing him to cry out, attracting the Ripper's attention. The creature eviscerates him, and Brooks remains as quiet as possible as John forces his way from the cell. Using a crossbow, he fires an arrow up under the boar's jaw, killing it. As Brooks and John make their escape, they come face to face with a young, wild member of the Tibbs clan. Fadeout to a black screen with a quote from Orwell's ""Animal Farm."""

An old feud still exists between John and Ricky, who is a Gulf War veteran, showing signs of drug addiction and mental illness. His brother Jake appears to be the only person maintaining control and keeping Ricky from flying off the handle. Quincy, who is eager to get to know them, is obviously inexperienced in any sort of outdoor activities, and Ricky accuses Wolfgang of being a 'pet' not a 'dog' seeming equally oblivious to hunting as well. When Jake Tibbs sets up some targets to see how well the others can shoot, boastful Ben makes a fool of himself, not being able to hit the target even once, while Wayne hits it not more than a couple of times. Brooks outshoots both men, to their surprise and chagrin-she impresses Tibbs by hitting the target with every shot. As the group makes their trip through the woods, they encounter an area called the Big Wallow, and, using a piglet call as a lure, they manage to attract several pigs to their location. One of them rams into Wayne's leg at full charge giving him a compound fracture at thekneecap and incapacitating him. Wolfgang goes charging after the boars while Brooks shows off her marksmanship talents and kills one of them. Ricky calls Jake to come look at something disturbing he's observed while skinning and dressing the hog they killed. Though adult-sized, it has no protective armor over its shoulders-it is not a full grown animal as they had thought, but a piglet-a very, very big piglet. Just as everyone is beginning to wonder about the truth of the Ripper legend, Quincy reappears, very excited. While looking for his dog Wolfgang, he had encountered a large crop of marijuana plants and now leads the others to it, leaving Brooks with Wayne. A conflict emerges when John objects to Jake and Ricky taking the plants for profit, as they are growing on his property and he wants no part of it. There is also a strange and disturbing sign posted near the plants, which leads John to think that the hippies that he thought were raising emus are actually growing pot instead. During the ensuing argument, Ricky snaps, and holds John at bay with a crossbow. John and Jake Tibbs are trying to gain control of the situation, when Ben arrives on the scene,thinks Ricky is about to kill John, and shoots him. Jake flees to tell his clan, and the others return to Wayne and Brooks. Quincy and Ben start making their way back to the cabin while Brooks and John leave Wayne to find something to make a stretcher with so they can carry him out of there and get back to the cabin and their vehicle. Shortly after their departure, Wayne is attacked by something we don't see, and manages to fire off a single round. Brooks and John circle back and find him missing, as well as Ricky's body. Meanwhile, Ben and Quincy make their way back to the cabin. They find Wolfgang's mutilated body, and determine he was killed by the Tibbs clan. Ricky and Jake's clan make their appearance, Ben manages to kill his pursuer and escape, but Quincy is knocked out of the vehicle he was attempting to escape in, and is executed by a single gunshot to the back of the head. Meanwhile, John and Brooks run into the mysterious Hippie Stranger as they hide in the forest; he is carrying a cattle prod, and tells them that he is looking for an escaped animal, and that they can contact the police from his commune. He helps them beat off an attack by the murderous Tibbs clan, and several hillbillies are killed. In the meantime, Ben has found the commune, where he is given drugs by several beautiful hippie women, and led into an enormous, muddy pen. He encounters a dying Wayne, who says that something has been eating him. Ben turns in shock as something approaches him from behind, and screams. The remaining Tibbs clan members have reached the woods around the commune;they are stalked and killed, one by one, by the murderous hippie women-all except one man, who is seized by something else-something we don't see. Brooks and John arrive at the commune with the Hippie Stranger. When John questions why Ben's equipment is there, but not Ben himself, they force him into a cell while the leader takes Brooks out into the pen. At last, we are shown what has been attacking people throughout the movie-it is the legendary Ripper, who is carrying the remains of one of the redneck clan in his mouth. Meanwhile, Jake makes his way into the commune, and is confronted by some of the women. He shoots a couple of them, and forces one of the women to let him into John's cell. As Jake sees the Ripper out in the pen and freezes in shock, the hippie woman he brought with him attacks, stabbing him in the eye with her boar's tooth necklace before John kills her. Jake dies from his wounds while the Hippie Stranger prepares to sacrifice Brooks to the boar, whom he and his followers have for some bizarre reason been worshiping-and feeding unwary people to. Brooks gets a hold of the Stranger's cattle prod and pokes him with it, causing him to cry out, attracting the Ripper's attention. The creature eviscerates him, and Brooks remains as quiet as possible as John forces his way from the cell. Using a crossbow, he fires an arrow up under the boar's jaw, killing it. As Brooks and John make their escape, they come face to face with a young, wild member of the Tibbs clan. Fadeout to a black screen with a quote from Orwell's ""Animal Farm."""

Based on Virgil's The Aeneid.  In general, the Avenger is a demythologized and condensed retelling of the second half of the Aeneid. It is also insular in its storytelling, making none of the references to Hannibal or Caesar found in The Aeneid. The movie differs from Virgil's poem in many ways, but retains the same essential structure of books VII - XII. In Virgil's Aeneid, the story begins with Juno provoking a storm that drives Aeneas' ships to the Carthage shores. The Avenger begins after Aeneas has arrived in Italy, skipping the well-known substories of Aeneas' affair with Dido and his journey through the underworld. Both stories recount the Trojan war. In the Aeneid, it is told by Aeneas in Dido's court; in The Avenger it is told through a flashback while viewing a fresco in King Latino's court. In The Aeneid, gods and goddesses play a critical role in developing the plot, whereas in the Avenger, there is little to no mention of the gods. Throughout the Aeneid, Aeneas's mother Venus actively protects him and advances his cause, while Jupiter's wife Juno actively opposes him and raises difficulties for him. Jupiter, Neptune, Apollo, Mercury and a host mythical creatures all make appearances as well. The movie borrows scenes from the poem, but often places them in a different context or reinterprets them with details altered. For example, in book V of the Aeneid, the crew lands in the Sicilian port Eryx and is greeted by King Acestes where they engage in a series of ceremonial games. One such game involves an archery contest where the target is a dove tied to a pole. In the Aeneid, Aeneas presides over the games , but in The Avenger, King Latino presides over the games while Aeneas competes in them. In the Aeneid, the first arrow strikes the pole, the second cuts the cord to the dove, while the third, delivered quickly after the second, catches the freed dove and brings it to the ground, winning the contest. Although the contest has now been won, Acestes shoots his bow anyway, and his arrow catches fire in the sky followed by a thunderbolt, which is interpreted as a great omen. In the Avenger, the contest called for archery on horseback, there were multiple doves tied, and only two contestants: Turno and Camilla. Camilla takes the first shot and misses, then is knocked off track by Turno, who takes the second shot and hits the dove. He is awarded a prize, but the allegation that he played unfair causes him to challenge the audience, whereupon Aeneas accepts the challenge and frees two doves with consecutive arrow shots. Throughout the Aeneid, not only the actions of the gods, but fate itself determines the outcome of events. This difference is highlighted by the titles: The Aeneid, as the genitive case, translates as Aeneas', referencing Aeneas' destiny to settle Italy, giving rise to a new race that will found Rome and rule the world. It is unclear from the story why the film is called The Avenger, as Aeneas could be avenging aggression against the Trojans by Turno, or avenging the death of Trojans in the war with the Greeks.

Despite the fact that he still has a loyal fan base, his last three films were flops, and he returns to New York to hear a pitch from a studio executive. The movie turns out to be The Pickle, a science fiction film with an absurd storyline, but when the executive offers him ""a ton of money,"" Harry immediately sells out his better judgment and agrees to direct the picture. Aside from a few flashbacks to Harry's childhood, and to the events leading up to the making of The Pickle, most of the story takes place on the day of the new film's premiere. Harry is reunited with his agent, publicist, son, daughter, mother, and ex-wives , and the movie explores these relationships in various combinations; Harry's Parisian girlfriend also plays a major role. Despite Harry's stress about the upcoming premiere -- he regrets selling out to make The Pickle, and fears that it will ruin his career -- the director spends time to enjoy the people in his life.  Dialogue establishes several details about Harry's career: His biggest success was a Western called Blue Sands; his most recent film, Paradise Jack, was a hit with his fans, but trashed by the critics and a disappointment at the box office. Harry had ambitions to make cinematic adaptations of Anna Karenina and Huckleberry Finn, but funding fell through after the box-office disappointment of Paradise Jack. His dream project is to direct an epic about Cortez and Montezuma starring Dustin Hoffman , but he angrily balks when a studio executive suggests updating the story to a present-day L.A. barrio. The success of The Pickle leads the executive to greenlight the Cortez/ Montezuma film, but Harry instead pitches a drama with a storyline loosely mirroring the events of his own return to New York.  The movie featured within the movie -- also called The Pickle -- involves a group of farmers who grow a pickle to gigantic proportions and convert it into a spaceship, which they fly into outer space. They land on a planet nearly identical to Earth, where one of the farmers  develops a romance with an advisor to the President of the United States.  The romance is ended when Sheedy decides that, as a vegetarian, she cannot live on a planet where all food is made out of meat."

The movie opens with the scene of the black-garbed killer preparing to disembark from a small house. The individual places several items into a brief case, appearing among them a deck of cards, a notebook, and a copy of the children's novel Mr. Pig and Sonny Too — a real publication written in 1977 by the American author Lillian Hoban. The book's title has an obvious connection to the film's. The individual closes up his brief case, standing upright and turning to reveal on camera the bleeding, half-naked body of another man lying prostrate on the floor. The living man kicks aside the corpse of the dead one and continues downstairs, packing up his belongings into a black car and driving away along a deserted road. The suited driver continues through an outstretched desert with power lines lining the side of the dirt trail. His vehicle passes an outcrop of rocks with an inscription painted on its face. Although perhaps being unintelligible, it appears to read either as ""ELLE"" or ""ELLIE"". Another sign crops up immediately after, written in black, though is essentially unreadable. The film cuts to another individual, the unidentified man , masked in white bandages covering his head. He wanders through the desert until reaching a telephone poll and sitting down, cross-legged. The driver's car pulls up to the side of the road, and the masked figure enters on the passenger's side. The two drive down another path and stop at a small house. They exit the car, where it can be seen now that the driver is leading the masked figure by a rope which binds his wrists, all the while carrying his brief case. The dilapidated doorway to the house is shown to have the number ""1334"" laid out in small bones at the top, otherwise adorned with a dominoes, a crucifix, caution tape and various photographs of someone's arms being bound. As the camera zooms onto the door frame, scenes flash to the victimized masked man's arms being tied with gauze tape, and then finally at the bottom of the doorway a box of dominoes opens up to reveal a keyhole. Through the keyhole a pig mask can be seen sticking through a broken wall. The scene cuts again to a corridor in the house – the word ""Look"" is graffitied along the wall where the masked man is bound at the wrists to the ceiling. The camera spins around the room before showing the two men outside again, this time the masked victim being led by his rope to a cellar. There the victimizer empties his brief case, among his things his deck of cards, a large metal key, a wig and a book entitled Why God Permits Evil with a demonic face printed on the cover. The captor places his hand on the head of a once-more bound-to-the-ceiling victim and pulls part of the bandage-mask from his eye, exposing his darting sight and sense of fear. A collection of pliers, knives, scissors and other instruments can be seen below."

Athirathram is the highest form of yagas, according to Vedas and if performed perfectly, it will result in heavy rain. The stage is set and all preparations are on full swing.

He challenges Somayaji and asks him if no heavy rains fall, will he give up Vedas and accepts atheism, to which Somayaji agrees. But he also put forward another question to Dathan that if it rains, will he be ready to follow his father's way, to which Dathan agrees.

While returning, he however let Ambu drive his car. Madan advised Ambu to stop acting, but Ambu claimed it as her profession which she can't give up, leading to an argument that caused the car to crash near a rock. At the same time they blamed a small white car that just passed by, to be the reason for the crash. Unable to bear anymore arguments, Ambu broke her relationship with Madan and walked away. Madan now suspects that Ambu may be having a relationship with her colleagues in the film industry. To end that, he hires detective Major Raja Mannar  to follow her when she goes on a cruise for vacation in Barcelona.

Johnson Space Center, Dr. Rhodes discovers that a comet has suddenly veered off its orbit and smashed into Mars. The explosion causes debris to travel towards Earth with the possibility of causing an extinction level event. At Ben Marshall's house, Ben refuses to give his son, Leo, a ride as he complained his own car smelled of mildew. However, Ben drives Leo to school and discovers Leo is in love with a fellow student, Lindsey. Leo is chatting with Lindsey when her ex-boyfriend, Sean, gives them threatening looks. Terry, Ben's autistic brother, refuses to let Samantha, Ben's daughter, take the school bus, which is having mechanical problems. Lynne, Ben's wife, comes home to discover that and drives Samantha to school. They are caught in a traffic jam caused by an incident involving the school bus. After discovering that an anomaly in space could have pulled the comet off orbit with its strong gravitational pull and that this anomaly is possibly reaching or bypassing Earth, they contact physicists, Trish Zane and Tom Lively, to help to prevent it. They discover that the anomaly is a strangelet, and it is traveling towards earth. The Russian and Chinese decide to fire nuclear missiles at the North Pole to cause a polar shift, hoping to resolve the issue. The polar shift triggers chain reactions which cause earthquakes, typhoons and tropical storms, which destroy New York , London, and other cities in the process. Ben brings Leo and Lindsey home after he receives news about the anomaly. They hide safely in the basement when a tornado struck, destroying the neighborhood. Terry convinces both Ben and Lynne that he has a solution to the problem. Ben drives Terry to the Space Center in Houston while Lynne takes Leo, Lindsey, and Samantha to the rescue center. Leo and Lindsey leave the center to search for Lindsey's family. They discover Sean and his friends raiding a house. Sean fatally shoots Leo in the midst of an argument and attempts to rape Lindsey. Lynne, worried that Leo and Lindsey are not back, goes to find them and rescues Lindsey. However, the house they were in is sucked away due to the effect of the strangelet nearing Earth. Along the way to Houston, Ben and Terry encounter a broken down vehicle. While trying to help, Ben is attacked but Terry takes out the attacker and they continue on their way. Ben suffers a heart attack but they manage to reach the Space Center. They gain entry because Terry knows Dr. Rhodes's verbal password. Terry manages to convince Dr. Rhodes of his calculations, which was shown to be accurate. Ben dies from his heart attack. After launching the nuclear missiles via LGM-118 Peacekeeper at the strangelet, time is reversed back to the starting of the film and Ben is shown to be much kinder to Terry and Leo.

A Space Marine by the name of Nidon is told to protect ""the Codex"" and races to obey his orders, just before a fireball engulfs the Space Marines. Brother Proteus  and Captain Severus  of the Ultramarines Chapter are locked in close combat on board a Space Marine Strike Cruiser. As the other members of Ultima Squad watch, Proteus manages to disarm Severus and demands his surrender; however Severus escapes Proteus's grasp and in turn defeats him, pronouncing that a Space Marine never yields. Afterwards the members of Ultima Squad are shown a sacred weapon of the Ultramarines, a Relic Thunder Hammer that lies in their ship's reclusium. The Captain and his right-hand man, Apothecary Pythol  lead the Ultima initiates in a swearing-in ceremony in which they are sworn in on the Thunder Hammer, ready for their first mission as Space Marines. When the ceremony is finished, Ultima Squad prepare themselves for their mission to the planet of Mithron. In transit to the planet's surface, Captain Severus{{cite web}} addresses Ultima Squad, informing them that they are to respond to a distress call from Mithron that was received shortly before all contact with the planet was lost. A distress beacon is detected coming from the planet's surface but it is unknown whether it is automated. The only site of importance in the system is a shrine guarded by a full company of the Imperial Fists along with a garrison of Imperial Guard. This implies that if they are calling for help, matters are truly dire. Leaving the bulk of his company on Algol to continue an ongoing campaign, Severus set off for Mithron with only the ten-man Ultima Squad for support. In the squad itself, Battle Brothers Proteus and Verenor  are the most eager to prove themselves in battle. On the tough and unforgiving surface of Mithron, Ultima Squad discovers that a terrible battle has taken place. The garrison force has been annihilated and the planet's Imperial shrine has been desecrated. This makes it evident to the Squad that the forces of Chaos are responsible for the attack. The squad decides they must continue and find the reason behind the distress beacon and to discern if there are any remaining survivors. While approaching the ruins of the shrine, the Ultramarines are ambushed by Chaos Space Marines from the Black Legion. Three Ultramarines, including Sergeant Crastor, are killed but the ambush is thwarted. The squad continues on into the ruined shrine but they are confronted by a Daemon Prince. The Daemon kills another Ultramarine and engages Captain Severus, and both combatants tumble over a cliff. With Severus gone and Sergeant Crastor dead, command of the squad falls to Proteus. While the rest of Ultima Squad wants to return to their Strike Cruiser and wait for reinforcements, Proteus decides to continue with the mission and find the source of the distress beacon. In the reliquary at the shrine's summit, they find Chaplain Carnak  and Brother Nidon ([[Johnny Harris , the sole surviving Imperial Fists. They reveal they have been protecting the Liber Mithrus, an ancient Codex given to the Imperial Fists at their founding by the The God-Emperor of Mankind himself, and a sacred relic to them. Ultima Squad agrees to help Carnak and Nidon take the book to safety, but Verenor and Proteus remain suspicious, questioning how just the two of them have managed to survive for so long while every other person died. As Ultima Squad{{cite web}} retreats to the extraction point, they are attacked by a massive force of Black Legion Chaos Space Marines. During the fight, Ultima Squad kills many of the attackers but suffer heavy casualties as well, being reduced down to four Ultramarines, Apothecary Pythol, Chaplain Carnak, and Brother Nidon. Just as Ultima Squad are about to be overwhelmed, Severus suddenly reappears and with his help, the remains of Ultima Squad, Carnak, and Nidon manage to escape back to the strike cruiser. Upon their return, Proteus confides to Severus about his suspicions of Carnak and Nidon believing that they may have been tainted by Chaos. Proteus and Severus along with Brother Hypax ([[Gary Martin  confront the Imperial Fists, with Severus taking the book and discovering that it is blank. When Hypax enters with the Ultramarines standard, it ignites, indicating to the Marines the presence of Chaos. Severus declares that Carnak has been tainted by Chaos.

Nidon becomes enraged and attacks Severus but is easily thrown off and knocked unconscious. Hypax questions why the standard continued to burn with Carnak  dead. However, it is revealed that it is Severus that was possessed by the Daemon that he fought. The possessed Severus grabs Proteus, Hypax then grabs the chapter standard and charges the daemon pushing it into the armoury. Hypax is last seen shutting the armory door to protect Proteus. When Proteus and Nidon return to consciousness, they find Verenor standing over Hypax's dead body, he had been impaled by the very standard he had been entrusted with protecting.

Proteus, Verenor, and Nidon chase Severus and confront him in the ship's reclusium. Severus's body can be seen to be mutating, rapidly developing features such as sharp teeth, horns and hoves. The daemon disables Nidon then Verenor and seizes Proteus. It reveals that it plans to possess Proteus, and while disguised as him, stow away on the strike cruiser to reach the Ultramarines' homeworld of Macragge, whereupon it will use the Imperial Fists' Codex to open a warp gate, allowing a horde of daemons to descend upon and destroy Macragge as happened on Mithron. However, Pythol arrives and intervenes, saving Proteus, but is killed by the Daemon. Proteus tears the sacred Thunder Hammer from its housing in the reclusium, while Verenor distracts the Daemon. Proteus uses the Thunder Hammer to kill Severus and banish the Daemon possessing him. Afterwards, it is shown that Proteus is eventually promoted to Sergeant with Verenor as his second in command, and both Marines are preparing to lead their own Ultramarine squad into battle. The final scene mirrors the opening one, showing the new Ultramarine recruits swearing on the same hammer that Ultima Squad had sworn on and that Proteus had used to slay Daemon Severus."

His replacement, Roy, arrives along with Vicente, a local. Shortly after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the Japanese launch an air attack on Guam, and the resulting chaos kills both Vicente and Chief Schultz. The five remaining men run for the hills. Meanwhile, the Japanese have attained medical documents from the American prisoners and have discovered that five men are missing. The five escape an oncoming Japanese patrol with the help of a local man and his son. However, their escape is short lived. While crossing a swamp, Roy loses a shoe and then steps on a scorpion. While not killing him, the toxins made him too weak to walk, forcing the men to stay put. As another Japanese patrol comes, the men decide to hide Roy with some brush, and Tweed gives him a pistol, promising him that he'll ""be back for the gun."" However, rather than running away, Turney decides to try to convince Roy to surrender with him, saying that the Japanese will take care of Roy's foot and that no harm can come to them because they will be prisoners of war. Turney uses his white shirt to signal to the Japanese his surrender. However, he is promptly killed. Panicking, Roy kills a Japanese soldier with the pistol, but he is shortly thereafter killed by a grenade. The three remaining men then stumble upon a copra plantation, where they meet Sus Quintagua, who promises to take them to his boss Santos, saying that he will know where they could hide. However, a plan to smuggle the Americans past the Japanese goes wrong when Chico is shot and killed by a stray shot by a drunken Japanese officer into one of the carts. The officer lets the rest of the copra convoy go without searching in exchange for Quintagua's bottle of coconut wine. Quintagua reveals that he has hidden an old radio, and the two Americans try to fix it. However, the battery goes out, and so, without Tweed knowing, Quintagua and Sonnenberg travel back to their abandoned jeep to get its battery. The Japanese then arrive at the village where Tweed is hiding. Tweed takes the radio with him, and Quintagua's wife shows him the way away from the village. They come upon the bound and beheaded bodies of Sonnenberg and Quintagua. Tweed then makes it to a leprosy hospital, where he is taken care of by a priest and his assistant. Tweed is told that the Japanese would not dare come there, so he will be completely safe there. The hospital even has a functioning radio, and Tweed decides to use a typewriter to write what he hears on the radio onto a makeshift newspaper called the Guam Eagle, which is secretly passed among the locals. However, the plan goes awry when the newspaper, meant to be read and then burned, incites the locals to rebel against the Japanese. The Japanese learn of the Guam Eagle. Shimoda reads one of the papers, and quickly sniffs out medicine, leading them to believe that Tweed is hiding in the leprosy hospital. The Japanese arrive at the hospital, gathering up all of the villagers. Tweed hides with the lepers in the isolation ward, as the Japanese soldiers were too horrified by the patients to look for him in there. However, a small fire is accidentally kicked into a house, causing it to catch on fire. Despite the people's efforts to put it out, the hospital is burned down. The priest is suspected of being the one who distributed the newspaper, and is taken away to be questioned. Tweed then awakes to find the priest's assistant and a man named Antonio Cruz. Fearful for his family's life because the Japanese have declared anyone found helping Tweed will be executed, Antonio hides Tweed on top of a large formidable rock face with a cave on the top. Antonio promises to bring supplies every now and then. Tweed then meets Antonio's beautiful daughter Jospehina, or ""Joe,"" who brings supplies in her father's stead. A nearby Japanese patrol is alerted to their position by an alarm clock that Joe brought with her. However, Tweed converts the alarm clock into an alarm that signals if anyone has found his location. The Japanese then pass another declaration stating that after one month, a farm in each district will be burned down if Tweed is not surrendered, dead or alive. Tweed, overcome with guilt, decides to turn himself in, but is stopped by the assistant and Antonio. The two men take Tweed's dog-tags, stating that they will ""give him dead."" Under the cover of night, the locals take the body of the recently deceased Shimoda and take it to the sea, where the flesh is eaten by crabs, leaving only a skeleton with Tweed's dog-tags on it. Antonio's family comes to celebrate Christmas with Tweed, and Antonio reveals that the Japanese have left Guam, save a few in Agana. Tweed is then surprised by a visit from the newly released priest and his assistant. However, they soon discover that the Japanese military is building up its forces and preparing for an attack by the US. Tweed discovers a Japanese gun position and, using a mirror, manages to warn an American ship away from the Japanese cannons. Tweed asks Joe not to come back because he fears it is too dangerous. The two share a passionate embrace and reluctantly part. Later that night, the American ship signals back to Tweed, but it alerts the Japanese to his position. Tweed signals that he has vital information. Tweed manages to rendezvous with the ship; his Japanese pursuers are killed. After the battle ends with an American victory, Tweed re-unites with Antonio and his family, hugging Joe on top of the rock where Tweed hid."

They mix their blood in a bowl of water and each of them drinks from it, so that their minds will be ""connected"" as they inhale fumes from the burning of oil secreted from a dead body. During the game, Ming, who does not participate and has the ability to see spirits, sees a female ghost with long hair and dressed in blue. He interrupts the game, much to everyone's unhappiness. Rubbish goes to the bathroom but a while later he dashes out in fear, saying that he saw a ghost. Ming and the others go into the bathroom and see Rubbish submerged inside the bathtub. They are horrified and confused, and see Rubbish approaching from outside the bathroom. They cower in fear and look back at the bathtub, which is now empty. They rush outside into the living room and see Rubbish lying dead on the floor, his face contorted into an expression of fear. Ming's elder sister Cissy, and her fiance Jack, are both reporters and they investigate the case. Cissy also scolds Ming for dabbling with the supernatural. In the meantime, Ming's three surviving friends encounter trouble - Big-B falls off a building and dies after seeing an illusion of Biggie asking him to meet her on the rooftop; Biggie strangles her mother to death before stabbing herself with a knife; Annie enters a trance and starts behaving strangely. Fearing that Ming might die as well, Cissy and Ming seek help from their friend Fa-mo, a drama teacher. They believe that the paranormal events are linked to the corpse oil, so Ming goes back to Rubbish's house to find clues, and sees Rubbish's ghost being taken away before he can ask anything. At the same time, Jack, who is skeptical about the supernatural, encounters a ghost in the washroom and falls sick, suffering from chills. Fa-mo tries to link the events together to solve the mystery. He discovers that Rubbish and Jack both lived around the same area, which used to be a village called Wong-san, where a bizarre massacre occurred nearly 100 years ago. Ming travels to the village, which is now abandoned and dilapidated, and sees a spirit tablet in the temple, with a woman's name ""Cho Yan-may"" inscribed on it. He runs away from the village in fear after seeing the spirits of the dead villagers. Later, in a nearby eatery, Ming and Fa-mo overhear a mad old man rambling something about Cho Yan-may and Lee Keung. They start searching for Lee Keung, and manage to contact him. Lee, a bearded old man, is a retired opera actor, and he initially refuses to tell Ming and Fa-mo anything about Wong-san Village but relents later. Lee Keung is an orphan and grew up in Wong-san Village. Cho Yan-may, a Cantonese opera actress, treated him kindly and he respectfully addressed her as ""Aunt May"". Cho was married to Po Man-tin, a teacher in the village. However, Po wanted to marry a rich girl so he plotted to frame his wife for infidelity so he could get rid of her. Po pretended to owe a man money and tricked Cho into helping him repay the ""debt"" by having sex with the man. He later accused his wife of adultery and bribed two men to kill her. Cho Yan-may was brutally beaten to death and her remains were abandoned in a graveyard. Cho's vengeful ghost later returned to take revenge and she caused her wicked husband and 66 villagers to die within three days. Lee Keung, who was still a boy then, witnessed everything and he managed to appease Cho's angry spirit by attaching a bracelet she gave him back on her wrist. Ming and Lee Keung visit the old graveyard and see that the place has become a construction site, and that the graves there have been excavated. Later, they drink from a nearby freshwater spring, the water source of Wong-san Village, and spot Cho Yan-may's ghost in the water, and suspect that Cho's remains might have been accidentally dumped inside the pool. While travelling along the streets later, Lee Keung hears Cho Yan-may's voice calling him and he heads towards an alley, where a metal bar suddenly falls on him and kills him. In the meantime, Ming receives a call from Annie's mother that Annie is in trouble, so he rushes to Annie's house, only to see her attempting suicide by overdosing on drugs. He calls an ambulance and brings her to hospital in time. Fa-mo contacts Ming and tells him that he has concluded that the ghost cannot personally kill people, but her vengeful aura can be transmitted through the water source  to people who drank the water, and cause them to experience wild hallucinations and eventually kill themselves in violent and odd ways. However, this realisation comes too late, as many have already drank from the ""polluted"" water source. They go to Jack's house and see Jack, who has also started behaving strangely after his encounter in the washroom and other paranormal experiences at home, forcing Cissy to drink a glass of the polluted water. Jack, in a trance, attempts to stab Fa-mo with a knife, but is knocked unconscious by Ming. Fa-mo and Ming tie up Cissy and Jack to prevent them from hurting themselves and each other. Ming and Fa-mo go back to the water source to dredge out Cho Yan-may's remains. Ming dives into the pool and retrieves a bracelet, and Fa-mo tells him to find Cho's body and attach the bracelet to it, in the hope of appeasing her anger. When Ming enters the pool again, he is immediately transported into a spiritual world - the graveyard - and sees a group of ghost-like figures, and one of them is himself. He is horrified and backs down, and sees Cho Yan-may's corpse beside him. He tries to attach the bracelet to her wrist, but she strangles him to death before he can do so. Back in the real world, Fa-mo sees Ming's dead body surfacing and he starts weeping. Fa-mo returns to Jack's house and sees Cissy screaming in fright. He musters enough courage to confront Cho Yan-may and drinks the polluted water as well. Cho Yan-may appears right before them, and Fa-mo tries to dispel their fears by saying that what they are experiencing is an illusion. When Cissy morphs into Cho, Fa-mo hugs her and she transforms back to Cissy. Cho Yan-may says ""You truly love her"" before disappearing. By then, Jack has regained consciousness and he is unhappy to see Fa-mo hugging his fiancee. Just then, Cho Yan-may appears beside him and the end credits start rolling against a background of a ghostly hand rising out of a water surface."

Consequently, he has created an ""Archetype Inducer"" and plans to bring to life the four greatest monsters from horror history -- the Mummy, the Wolfman, Dracula, and Frankenstein's monster -- in order to do his bidding. Two weeks have passed, and David has been so busy at the video store that he has not yet located Berber. Not to worry. Berber shows up at the library looking for the first edition of ""Dracula"" and Anna recognizes him. Holding Berber at bay with a pair of scissors, she phones David and tells him to hurry over to the library. Before David can get there, however, Berber zaps Anna with a taser, steals ""Dracula"", and takes both the book and Anna to his laboratory. When Anna comes to, she finds herself cuffed to a table. Berber informs her that she is just what he needs -- a virgin between the ages of 20 and 35 -- to sacrifice naked in order to make the Archetype Inducer work. Suddenly, David breaks into the lab, having gotten Berber's address off his computer at the video store. He knocks Berber out and releases Anna. Anna grabs all the manuscripts, and they hightail it out of the lab. Unfortunately, they weren't quick enough. Berber had already turned on the Archetype Inducer. While David and Anna are making their getaway, four figures step out of the machine -- the Mummy , the Frankenstein monster , the Wolfman , and Dracula  -- only they are midgets. Dracula is not happy that he has been brought to life as a three foot midget, but Berber assures him that he can change that if he can get his hands on Anna, who is now part of the equation. So the monsters offer to get her for him. Meanwhile, Anna isn't too happy either about the bill that David sent her for his services...$6,200. Anna's supervisor, Miss Christina , isn't happy either because Anna keeps dodging her advances. When Anna once again dodges her advances, Christina stays late at the library in order to make love to the first edition of ""Jane Eyre"" in the Rare Book Reading Room. When she hears noise out on the floor, she goes to investigate and falls prey to Dracula's net. Now it's Berber who isn't happy, because Christina is not Anna, and he must have Anna for the procedure to work. However, Dracula forces him to try it anyway. Berber switches on the machine, Christina disappears then reappears as a Viking then disappears again. True to Berber's word, the procedure didn't work, so the monsters set out again to find Anna. First stop is David's house, where Dracula attempts to wrest Anna's address out of him, but David refuses to comply. When Dracula tries to bite his neck, David flashes the crucifix on his necklace, says, ""Thank God I'm a Catholic,"" and races out the door. The monsters and Berber follow him, assuming that he will lead them to Anna. David leads them to the library. The monsters attempt to capture Anna, but David grabs Berber and threatens to break his neck if they don't leave Anna alone. David pulls out Berber's taser and threatens Dracula, who simply zaps it, causing it to explode. Anna and David are taken back to the lab where Berber again prepares for the procedure. When Dracula asks for assurance that it will work this time, Berber won't guarantee it because Anna is not a virgin. Dracula suggests that they find another woman, a virgin this time, to go through the procedure along with Anna, but Berber says that will unbalance things. The only way to keep everything balanced is to find an opposite to Anna -- a male virgin. After asking David about his virginity, Dracula is assured that he is indeed a virgin, and the preparations continue while David tries to come up with a catch. At the last minute, Anna has an idea. She points out to the monsters that, if they stay in the real world, they will eventually die like all humans do. However, if they return to the pages of the novels from whence they came, they will live on forever as the legends they are. Just as Berber pushes the red button to start the machine working, David and Anna escape from their cuffs. Instead of them being sucked into the machine, Christina the Viking reappears, grabs Berber, and they both disappear again. Anna and David conclude that the machine turned them into archetypes of a Viking and a mad scientist. Having had a little time to ponder, Dracula tells David to press the red button again. They have chosen to return to their own lands as the legends they are rather than to die in the real world, he explains. Before the monsters are sucked back into the pages of their respective novels, Dracula tells Anna that she is wise ""for someone who has not yet lived a single lifetime. But do not fear,"" he adds, ""we will always be with you...in your nightmares."" Epilogue: Anna shows up at David's video store, gives him a check for his services, and informs him that Berber's lab has been torn down. She also gives him a book, the first English language edition of Venus in Furs. David thanks her and admits that he saw the movie. ""1970, directed by Jess Franco , starring Klaus Kinski. Actually, there was an earlier version directed by Larry Buchanan, the guy who did Zontar: The Thing from Venus . Actually, I think there's a '94 version but it's all in Dutch...,"" he drones on. Anna interrupts him with a kiss."

Then men bearing crosses drove the heathens to the fringes of the earth. A mysterious mute Norse warrior only known as One-Eye , is held captive up above in misty highlands by a Chieftain , where he is forced to fight to the death against other captives. While One-Eye is imprisoned, a young boy tends to him regularly, bringing him food and water. One-Eye is shown to have the ability to foresee events in his dreams; a dream of him bathing in a pond leads him to discover an arrowhead on the bottom of a bed of water. Using the arrowhead, he breaks free, slaughters everyone except for The Boy and a warrior whom he lets escape. As One-Eye kills the last of his slavers the man shouts angrily at One-Eye that he will go back to hell. He finds the chieftain and places his head on a nithing pole, a magical rite Norse pagans used to place a curse upon someone.  While leaving the land, One-Eye soon realizes that The Boy is pursuing him. They reach a small group of Crusaders, Christians fresh from killing and enslaving pagans as they get ready to go on a crusade to Jerusalem. The leader of the group, The General , asks One-Eye to join him. He reasons that, live or die, One-Eye may cleanse his soul of sin by committing to the Crusades. The General, who has been told that The Boy has been a slave, asks him what he wants to now do and The Boy tells him he wishes to go home, but he does not know where home is. The General asks The Boy if he knows about One-Eye's origin. The Boy tells him that One-Eye was brought up from hell which, he has been told, lies on the other side of the ocean. It is left untold if he is talking about the Christian hell or hel: the underworld of Norse mythology.  The Crusaders, The Boy, and One-Eye are on a boat destined for Jerusalem. The crew is broken, thirsty and hungry, and with no wind for several days. A thick fog shrouds them constantly, preventing them from determining their direction or location. Lost, the crew begins to believe that the voyage is cursed, which some attribute to the presence of One-Eye's companion, The Boy. Mutiny nearly arises as a crew member who attempts to murder The Boy is killed by One-Eye. Later, sensing a change, One-Eye takes a drink from the water and discovers that the boat is actually in an estuary and no longer at sea. With the fog dissipating, the crew sees the first sight of land off in the distance.  Upon landing, to their surprise, the Holy Land is not the half-dry place they expected the Near East to be. Rather, it resembles a taiga with vast forests full of lakes and mountains. The crew sets out to explore the area, finding no animals to hunt, and no food to eat. Nearly starved, the crew continues until coming across some aboriginal burial sites. One of the crew members  leaves the group to venture on his own. The group searches for him for hours and some blame One-Eye as his killer. The General reasons that there is no proof of One-Eye killing him. Realizing they have not reached Jerusalem, the crew prepares the ship to depart and head home. While on water, the group is taunted by a single arrow, killing one of their men. Terrified, they soon come to believe that they are in Hell.  Upon reaching a nearby shore, the men drink a psychotropic brew given to them by their leader. One-Eye's dreams begin to intensify. He wades to a small island to construct a cairn. Meanwhile, the other men separate experiencing a variety of emotions, including apathy, desperation and despair. Some pray, others wander, others wait. One-Eye and the group are then confronted by a lost crew member who emerges from the forest naked and his skin covered in mud in which runes are drawn. The Lost One says he can hear One-Eye's thoughts, and translates that the warrior is saying they are in Hell. One of the crew members has become completely disillusioned and accuses The General of lying to him. He then declares there is no God and proceeds to attack One-Eye. One-Eye kills him and several other crew members who attack him.  Arrows from the forest continue to taunt and kill those left behind, soon after the band breaks up. As the priest ([[Gary Lewis leaves to follow One-Eye, the General stabs him and declares that he will stay and create a new Jerusalem. The Lost One laughs at him. The wounded priest and the General's son , follow One-Eye to the top of a tall hill. The Priest sits down. After talking to One-Eye, the General's son goes back to his father knowing the man is probably dead and that he too will die. As One-Eye leaves, The Boy looks at The Priest, expecting him to follow. The Priest stays behind, giving the boy a warm smile and knowing the child will be safe with One-Eye. The Priest is mortally wounded, seen with flies buzzing nearby, viewing the valley landscape, when an aura of light surrounds him. One-Eye and The Boy successfully reach the coastline and are soon met by a large tribe of Native American  warriors. One-Eye regards them from the distance then dropping his weapons walks towards them. They beat him to death. As One-Eye dies he recalls the cairn he built and while slowly submerging beneath the water he realizes his fate. The tribe allows The Boy to live and they then venture back into the forest. The Boy  looks off to the coast and enters into a dream sequence which has One-Eye looking back at him.

G.One tricks Ra.One into shooting him without his H.A.R.T. attached, leaving Ra.One helpless; furious, he creates ten copies of himself. Prateek, unable to differentiate the real Ra.One, asks G.One to quote Shekhar: ""If you join the forces of evil, its shadows shall always follow you"". The pair realise that only one of the ten Ra.Ones has a shadow: the original one. G.One shoots and destroys him, absorbs Ra.One's remains and disappears. Six months later, Prateek and Sonia return to London, where the former manages to restore G.One to the real world."

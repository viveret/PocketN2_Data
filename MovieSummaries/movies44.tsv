Dave, an avid comic book fan, is bitter that people do not intervene when a crime is being committed. He purchases a bodysuit and, after making modifications, embarks on a campaign to become a real-life superhero, despite having no superpowers or skills. After his first crime-fighting encounter leads to him getting stabbed and getting run over in a hit and run, leaving him with permanent nerve damage, he gains an enhanced capacity to endure pain, and surgical implants required to repair multiple skeletal fractures give him resistance to further bone-crushing injuries. His effort to conceal the truth, claiming he had had his clothes thrown off after being mugged, leads to rumors that he is gay. His longtime crush, Katie Deauxma  immediately attempts to become his friend, having always wanted a ""gay BFF""; Dave hesitantly goes along with it. After intervening in a gang attack, Dave's actions are recorded by a bystander and put on the internet, turning him into a celebrity. Calling himself ""Kick-Ass"", he sets up a MySpace account so he can be contacted for help. After responding to a request from Katie, he deals with a drug dealer, Rasul, who has been harassing her. Rasul and his thugs quickly overpower him, but he is rescued by eleven-year-old vigilante Hit-Girl , who kills Rasul first, and then kills all of Rasul's thugs and leaves with her father, Big Daddy . They believe he has potential, but warn him to be more careful, and give him a way to contact them if needed. Big Daddy is Damon Macready, a former cop who has a long-standing grudge against crime boss Frank D'Amico  for framing him as a drug dealer, leading to the suicide of his wife. His former partner at the New York Police Department, Marcus Williams , became guardian to his daughter, Mindy. Big Daddy, however, has reclaimed Mindy and is training her to be a skilled crime-fighter, against Marcus' wishes, hoping to take down D'Amico, sabotaging his organization. However, Big Daddy's actions inadvertently made D'Amico target Kick-Ass instead, believing that it was the latter that killed his men. D'Amico's son, Chris , suggests a different approach. He assumes the role of the vigilante ""Red Mist"" in order to befriend Kick-Ass and lure him into a trap. The attempted ambush is undone by Big Daddy, who independently kills D'Amico's men and sets the building on fire. Following his escape from the warehouse fire, Dave decides to quit being Kick-Ass. He confesses the truth to Katie, and she forgives him and becomes his girlfriend. A week later, after finding a number of messages from Red Mist urgently requesting they meet, Dave decides to don his Kick-Ass costume one last time. At the meeting, Red Mist creates a ruse that both he and Kick-Ass have a bounty placed on both of their heads. Believing the story, Kick-Ass calls his allies, unwittingly leading Big Daddy and Hit-Girl into an ambush. Upon arriving at one of Big Daddy's safe houses, Red Mist shoots Hit-Girl out of a window, and D'Amico's men storm the place, capture Big Daddy, taking Kick-Ass with them. D'Amico intends to have his thugs torture and execute his captives in a live Internet broadcast viewed by millions, including Katie and Marcus, who can only watch helplessly. Hit-Girl, having survived the shooting, storms the hideout, killing all of the gangsters; but during the struggle, one thug sets Big Daddy on fire, fatally burning him. He and Hit-Girl share a tearful farewell before he dies. Kick-Ass tries to convince Hit-Girl to quit her dangerous lifestyle, but she plans to finish what her father started, and Kick-Ass agrees to help. Hit-Girl infiltrates D'Amico's headquarters, pretending she lost her parents, kills the lobby guards and makes her way upstairs. Arriving at D'Amico's penthouse, she proceeds to kill every henchman in her path. She runs out of bullets at the end when Kick-Ass arrives on a jet pack fitted with miniguns that Big Daddy had previously acquired, and kills the remaining thugs. Kick-Ass and Hit-Girl then take on D'Amico and his son. While Kick-Ass fights Red Mist in the training room and the two manage to knock each other unconscious, Hit-Girl is overpowered by D'Amico  after a vicious fight and lies helpless as he prepares to kill her. As D'Amico aims his gun, Kick-Ass comes around and, armed with a bazooka that D'Amico's bodyguard had taken from Big Daddy's safehouse, comes to her aid, blasting D'Amico out of the window where he explodes in mid-air. Red Mist revives in time to see Kick-Ass and Hit-Girl leaving on the jet pack, and is powerless to stop them. Mindy and Dave retire from crime fighting to live a more normal life, and Mindy returns to live with Marcus, and enrolls at Dave's school. Dave has been told to look after Mindy, ""not that she needs it"". Dave explains that although he is done with crime fighting, a new ""generation"" of superheroes have been inspired by his endeavor, and the city is safer as a result. Red Mist is shown donning a new mask as he quotes Jack Nicholson as the Joker, ""As a great man once said, 'Wait till they get a load of me'.""<ref name 16 April 2010 | first  Ditzian | title  http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1637258/20100416/story.jhtml |publisherViacom | archiveurl  23 January 2011 }}"

They live a generally peaceful life, except for Caliban who has to work hard with the garden. A few miles away lies the dark island Plutonia, where the greedy capitalists Slug and Slagg rule. Once as green and flourishing as Melonia, Plutonia is now perceived as hell on earth, where children are forced to, under slave conditions, build weapons and tools of war, which Slug and Slagg believe is the way of the future. With Plutonia's resources nearly exhausted, Slug and Slagg turn their gaze on the unexploited Melonia, scheming to take it over with a gigantic drill. The movie begins with one of the child slaves, a boy named Ferdinand, escaping from Plutonia in a box, and ends up on Melonia, where Miranda and Prospero nurse him back to health. Prospero has just finished a magical growth elixir , which Caliban is entrusted. Slug and Slagg kidnap Caliban and bring him to Plutonia. Ferdinand, Miranda, Prospero and some others journey to Plutonia in order to free Caliban, which eventually turns into a quest to free Ferdinand's enslaved friends. Eventually, Miranda helps the children escape by transforming them into birds and transporting them into an old theater, where William the poet is making a less than successful attempt at staging Shakespeare's The Tempest. After breaking out of his prison, the thirsty Caliban thoughtlessly drinks the elixir. Slug and Slagg, encouraged by Caliban's growth, attempt to coax him into working for them, but their rants of superiority by arms falls upon deaf ears. They then attempt to destroy Caliban using the great drill, but he easily lifts it off the ground and plunges it into the floor, causing the island to sink to the bottom of the ocean in a gigantic maelstrom. Slug and Slagg are unable to escape the maelstrom and as they do not appear again, it's safe to assume that they sink to the bottom and drown. The theater almost sinks as well, but is saved by Caliban. Prospero loses his magical powers, but accepts it readily, knowing that everybody's power will replace his magic. He frees Caliban and Ariel from his service, and the movie ends with a singing Ariel flying off into the sunset.

Speedy informs him that he has been sleepwalking, which worries Daffy since ""a guy could get hurt that way."" Speedy offers to stay up for the night in exchange for five pesos, and promises that he will wake Daffy up if he starts sleepwalking again. Back at Daffy's house, Speedy tells him that if he notices Daffy sleepwalking, he'll ring a bell in order to wake him up. Daffy goes to sleep, but Speedy has no intention of staying up for the whole night and ties a tripwire to the bedpost, also connecting it to the bell, so that if Daffy starts sleepwalking again the bell will wake up both Daffy and Speedy. Sure enough, Daffy begins sleepwalking and trips the bell, which wakes Speedy who then starts frantically ringing it himself to make it look like he was on guard. Afterwards, Daffy goes to sleep again, though not before Speedy makes him pay another five pesos for his continued services. As dawn breaks, Daffy starts sleepwalking again, but this time he gets out of bed on the other side and leaves the house the other side of the bed, which fails to make the bell ring. He sleepwalks into a construction site, and ends up at the top of an under-construction skyscraper. In the meantime, Speedy finally wakes up and realizes that Daffy isn't there. Speedy then frantically leaves the house in pursuit. Using his super-speed, Speedy gets to the construction site, and gets to the top of the skyscraper just in time to prevent Daffy from falling down a hole in the girders.

When her flamboyant friend Jane  wins a trip for two to Greece, Shirley uncharacteristically puts herself first and accepts her invitation to join her. Upon their arrival in Mykonos, Jane promptly abandons her companion for a romance with a man she met on the plane before it even took off. When the plane lands, Shirley sets off on her own, with Jane promising to return that night. Jane doesn't surface for several days, but Shirley is fine on her own, exploring the island. Eventually she is ""rescued"" by her fellow Brits Jeanette and Dougie  at lunch one day. During lunch, another British couple begins to disparage Greece as being too Greek. Shirley can't stand more than a few insults before she blasts them all, letting them know that the Greeks are responsible for many modern accomplishments that they take for granted. After dinner , she goes off alone and happens upon a taverna. She then asks the owner to help her fulfill a dream she's had: drinking wine by the sea. The owner, Costas Dimitriades , willingly helps her by moving a small table and chair next to the sea. After realizing that the grass is indeed greener, Shirley is worse off than before. Costas comes by and offers to walk her back to her room. Once there, he invites her out to his brother's boat the next day. When she balks, he promises not to try to seduce her. Convinced that he only wants to cheer her up, she agrees. The next morning, as Shirley is preparing to meet Costas, Jane returns to the room, begging for forgiveness and not giving Shirley a word in edgewise. As Jane goes to change for their day together, Costas shows up and Shirley leaves with him, with Jane trailing behind in disbelief. Shirley then pawns Jane off on the uptight Brits as payback for leaving her alone. Shirley and Costas go out on the boat. Shirley goes skinny-dipping, revealing to the camera that she doesn't want Costas to keep his promise from the day before. After she kisses him, he doesn't. Once Jane hears about what has happened, she believes that Shirley has fallen in love with Costas. However, Shirley reveals to the camera that she's fallen in love with the idea of living. Shirley spends more time with Costas, yet she is despondent about having to leave soon. Once the time comes, Shirley gets as far as the airport before turning back. Once back at the taverna, she finds Costas handing the same line to another tourist as he did with her. However, Shirley isn't upset because she didn't return for him; she wants a job. Once Jane arrives at the airport back in Britain, she drops Shirley's suitcase without a word to Shirley's husband Joe, who is carrying an armful of flowers. He is shocked and embarrassed at being left and calls Shirley any time he can, from a variety of places. He becomes more and more desperate the longer she is away, as she becomes more content with her new life. Finally their son tells Joe to go and get her instead of insisting she come back. Hurt by his son's words, Joe sets off for Greece. Shirley, having received a telegram about Joe's impending arrival, prepares for it. Costas is afraid of a confrontation with Joe, and begs off with a fake excuse. Once Joe arrives at the taverna, he walks by Shirley, not recognising her. She calls him by name and when he turns around, sees, as Shirley puts it, ""not the wife or the mother, but Shirley Valentine"". After gathering himself, she pours him a glass of wine and invites him to sit with her at the table and chairs by the sea."

The character is rather similar to the carnival operator types he would play in Poppy and You Can't Cheat an Honest Man. McGonigle's daughter Betty  is loyal to her father. She tries to discourage a suitor named Wally Livingston , telling him he should follow his father's wishes and go to college instead of trying to become an actor. Wally's wealthy father  arrives in the town where the troupe is scheduled to perform a Victorian melodrama called The Drunkard. One of the players has resigned, and Wally wins the part, affording him a chance to act and also to perform a couple of songs in his strong tenor voice. His father is impressed by his son's talent, and his skepticism about Betty is eased when he learns that she has been trying to get Wally to return to college. The play itself, at 20 minutes the film's centerpiece, is acted in the style of the period. Reaction shots show audience members at a pitch of emotional involvement: an elderly spectator is cautioned to think of his heart; a young sophisticate skeptically asks his pretty date, ""Do you think this is a good play?"" After the play concludes, Fields comes onstage and performs his juggling act. This setpiece affords a rare opportunity to observe Fields's famous vaudeville specialty, as Fields juggles airborne balls and cigar boxes. In this bit, Fields looks relatively fit and trim, in contrast to the plumper look that became part of his trademark in later years. McGonigle learns that the troupe's sponsor is canceling the tour, due to poor advance reports. McGonigle tells Betty and Wally that he has decided to close the show and to seek his fortune in New York City. The bride and groom and his father ride the train back to the Livingston home, and Betty gets a telegram from her father stating that things are going well in the big city. In reality, McGonigle has become a snake-oil salesman. In the film's final scene, he is shown conning a crowd of onlookers into buying a fake ""cure for hoarseness"". Tammany Young, a recurring member of Fields' small cadre of actors, plays his dim-witted assistant, Marmaduke. Jan Duggan plays a wealthy and untalented widow, Cleopatra Pepperday , whom McGonigle exploits to stave off the local sheriff, who is Cleo's boyfriend. Baby LeRoy is her son, Albert, who pesters McGonigle, including squeezing his bulbous nose and dipping his watch in molasses; but McGonigle gets even by taking an opportunity to boot the child in the rear."

Having lost faith in the real relationships that he sees around him, Abhik seeks solace in the virtual world. While navigating through this virtual world, Abhik develops an online relationship with a young woman, without knowing anything about her. She is Brinda - a young, dynamic television journalist. She comes from a conventional middle-class home, and her parents live in Jamshedpur. For both Abhik and Brinda, who do not know each other's real names and whereabouts, this online communication soon becomes an increasingly intense relationship, more real than virtual. While this relationship blossoms within the confines of two computer screens, Abhik gets his six minutes of fame on national television, when he successfully masterminds a raid on a consignment of illegal arms. Brinda telephones him to ask for an on-camera interview, but Abhik declines, stating that did not want to sensationalize the event any further. Ironically the virtual lovers, Abhik and Brinda have an acrimonious first meeting in the real world. It happens at the launch of a controversial mega project of the big-time real estate entrepreneur, Vijay Ketan Mehra. Unaware that she knows Abhik so well on the Internet, Brinda, still smarting from Abhik's refusal, gets into a bitter exchange of words with him. The argument veers to issues like sensationalism and soon enough, it is clear that Brinda and Abhik's real-life interaction has started off on a sour note. Before leaving in a huff, Brinda overhears a piece of conversation between two men about Mehra's project. This gives her a lead to a potentially big scoop. Ranjan and Paromita, an estranged couple, become the bridge between Brinda and Abhik. Ranjan is Abhik's cousin, but he is more of a friend, philosopher and guide. Ranjan is now a stockmarket addict and leads a lonely life after having separated from Paromita a few years ago. Ranjan is as acutely sensitive and perceptive as he is bitter and cynical on the surface. Paromita , is a senior marketing executive with the channel where Brinda works. For Brinda and Abhik, things take a different turn – from hostility to a grudging interest in each other – when they bump into each other at Ranjan's birthday party, which is secretly organized as a surprise by Paro. At the party, Brinda and Abhik get to know each other a little better. The mood of the party turns romantic yet poignant with Paro singing Ranjan's favourite song at his insistence. She has never sung that song ever since she left Ranjan's home. In the virtual world of the Internet, Brinda and Abhik's online chatting continues unabated, even though their identities remain undisclosed. Abhik confides in Ranjan that he is probably falling in love, although he does not know with whom. Ranjan warns Abhik with his usual cynicism and reminds him of the perils and pains that often define love. Behind his sardonic comments Abhik gets a glimpse of Ranjan's sensitivity and loneliness. After hearing his cousin's advice, Abhik leaves feeling confused yet still not convinced enough to stop falling further in love.Paro gets a rather lucrative offer from Mumbai. But she is in two minds between upgrading her career and staying back for lost love. As the crisis deepens in her mind, she seeks Ranjan's advice. Although it is bound to intensify his loneliness, Ranjan encourages her to shift to Mumbai. Paro gets confused by Ranjan's pragmatic, well-meaning advice, as she had hoped and expected him to want her to stay back in the city. Meanwhile, a series of upsetting events, including Paro's talk about moving to Mumbai and her final break up with her boyfriend, weigh Brinda down. She feels torn between opposite poles of love and friendship. The only thing she can find solace is with her virtual friend, who seems to be her only source of comfort. At work, Brinda hits a stumbling block while doing an investigative story on V.K Mehra's El Dorado project. At this point, she turns to Abhik for help. Brinda notices some uncanny similarities between Abhik and her anonymous chat friend, in the way they talk, and in their choice of phrase. Something about Abhik reminds her of her online friend. As she follows the leads given by Abhik, she manages to get an important interview lined up which can give her the proof she needs to wrap up her story. The night before her interview, a particular phone conversation with Abhik strikes her. She gets onto the net, and tells her chat friend that they should meet. But this is a meeting which is not destined to happen as things take an unexpected turn. During reaching office for night shift Brinda died in a massive car accident and the meeting never happens. That's the thing is 'Endless waiting for love'. Paro leaves for Mumbai. The film ends with the song 'Bhindesi Tara'.

His cries for help aren't perceived by anyone except one drunk, who is caught by the police when calling for assistance. Finally, at night, a young couple making love on the pile of tires notice him. They help him to get up and assist him to his home. He is hurt in the leg and understands that he can't take care of himself anymore, so he is put in a retirement home. At the home, Johan is sitting in a wheelchair staring out the window, mumbling for himself about his past to an animated flashback. Johan grew up on the countryside, when the grass was always green. His father was strong, his mother liked to bake. He was also harassed by a boy named Evert, while at the same time being in love with Evert's cute sister. At his confirmation, Evert tackled him so that all the girls' dresses were ruined by the sacramental wine. This made Evert's sister laugh at him, and with his heart broken he decided to run away to Stockholm. Johan started to work as a masonry, and carried bricks and bottles of beer to a foreman who consumed one bottle for ever brick he laid. In his loneliness, Johan fantasized about women, and made his first rousing visit to a brothel. He grew a moustache and visited an amusement park with two friends he had made, Sven and a man from Värmland who he has a hard time remembering the name of.

It turns out to be an emergency signal and the two friends together with Plåt-Niklas and The Parrot set out on an expedition to resque whoever is sending the signal. While crossing a stream, though, Froggy Ball falls down a small waterfall and ends up in a dark cave. While looking for a way out he stumbles upon the Cone People who live there and quickly befriends the Cone King and Queen. In the meantime Charlie Strap has met up with Kottegrön, a young and impulsive female cone, and soon joins Froggy Ball and the others. It turns out that the Cone People are the ones who have been sending the signal, and when elevated up to a tree top Charlie Strap and Froggy Ball see a helicopter landing, with three evil businessmen from the company Tonto-Turbo who are planning to tear down a huge part of the forest. When the businessmen leave, Kottegrön ends up being with them on the helicopter.  Charlie Strap and Froggy Ball hang on to the landing skids, but eventually fall off high up in the air over a lake. Luckily it turns out that Carlie's tailcoat can be used as a parachute, and Froggy Ball even learns how to steer it by pulling the tails so they can land on a steam boat. On the boat Plåt-Niklas and The Parrot succeed to locate them so they can join them again. The boat takes them to Gripsholm Castle, which turns out to be where the businessmen were heading too, as their full plan is to move the old castle to the cleared space in the forest and turn it into a hyper modern luxury hotel, replacing most of its walls and floors with glass. This will be made possible by hacking the authorities' computers with a special program they are keeping on a floppy disk. Kottegrön, who has been hiding in a briefcase, tries to steal the disk but fails. Instead she, Charlie Strap and Froggy Ball end up on the bottom of the castle well, but are soon resqued by Plåt-Niklas who has the ability to fly. In the meantime the men from Tonto-Turbo leave again in their helicopter. Plåt-Niklas calculates that they are heading to the city, before he flies back to the cone forest with Kottegrön. In the city, Charlie Strap and Froggy Ball walk up to Tonto-Turbo's central office and confront them, but are simply laughed at and disregarded. The businessmen then head off to the Nobel party where they have been invited. The two friends, left in the office, discover that the men forgot to bring the floppy disk with them. They try to find out which one of the disks at the office it is that is the real one, and while trying one in the computer the frog ends up inside of a computer game and Charlie has to control him into safety with the joystick. Soon after that, one of the men returns - and takes the right disk with him. Unable to get into the Nobel party, Froggy Ball is ready to give up when a submarine appears. Out of it come Plåt-Niklas and Kottegrön who have returned. Through the kitchen they smuggle themselves into the party by hiding in the dessert - an ice cream parade. When inside Froggy Ball holds a speech where he accuses the men from Tonto-Turbo in public. The atmosphere becomes confused, and the men capture the two friends and decide to get rid of them once and for all. But then suddenly The Fox, who had previously only been seen in a short cameo in the very beginning of the story, arrives and causes disruption. While the men are distracted everybody can escape, and Kottegrön steals the floppy disk. After a wild chase though, the men recapture the disk, but only to see an army of cones arrive and chase them into the water, where also the disk is dropped by The Parrot. Back in the cone forest the frog is awarded a prize from the hands of the cone Minister of Flower Pots and the businessmen are given a new profession - shaving sheep, which they seem to enjoy.

Suddenly, he pushes her underwater, and she begins to drown. While looking up at his face from under the water, she sees the visage of an old woman above her. She then wakes up, and we find out that she has fallen asleep and begun to drown. Her boyfriend Danny  wakes her up, and the two make out. The scene then switches to Zane, who has enlisted the help of dorky nerd Phil  to research his family history. Zane decides to visit his family home, bringing Phil, Rene, Danny, and her two sorority pledges, Julie ""Cow""  and Laura ""Dog"" . The two pledges have been forced to dress up as animals  and are being brought to Zane's family home as an initiation. On the way to the cabin, Zane constantly sees an old woman on the side of the road, culminating in her appearance in the middle of the road, which causes him to almost crash. He decides she is a hallucination, and continues on to his family's land. Lester , the caretaker of the house, has been living in a trailer on the land, and searching for gold. It appears that he has found some, but does not tell anyone when they arrive. The college students marvel at his stuffed oddities, as he has become an amateur taxidermist. He warns the group not to go into the subcellar, or to go outside after dark. Zane does not take his warnings seriously, and they continue on to the house. Settling in, Rene enslaves Julie and Laura and forces Phil to tell how he knows so much about Rene and Zane's family history. Phil goes outside to get a signal on his mobile phone, but is split in half by the ghost with an axe. Thinking Phil is sitting in the car talking on his phone, the five remaining teens decide to learn more about the family history. After that, Rene decides to have a little fun with Julie and Laura by setting them a task; they must run to Lester's caravan and bring back one of his stuffed animals as proof they were there. They must wear one item of clothing and it can't be an overcoat. Julie chooses to wear her pants and Laura chooses to wear her boots, and although Laura accomplishes the task, Julie doesn't because she sprains her ankle. Rene says that she was once given the task but had to go three blocks, down fraternity row, and that she chose to wear a ski mask. Rene decides to give Julie one more task, and that's to take off her clothes, except for her underclothes, and blindfold her. Rene takes Zane's belt and uses it on Julie as a test of trust. Soon, Rene and Laura depart Julie and leave her standing there. Danny decides to go get Phil but finds out that he's dead before he gets his face cut off. When the lights go out, Zane goes out to check the machine to find it's still functioning normally, but the cable was cut. Zane finds Danny's faceless body, as do Rene and Laura. Zane, Rene and Laura dash back inside the house, thinking Lester is behind Danny's murder, but they find Lester dead as well. They try to escape with their car, but its sabotaged. They grab Lester's keys and Laura dashes to Lester's caravan to get his truck. While Zane and Rene are still in the house, Zane gets locked in another room and Rene is knocked unconscious with the spirit scratching the words ""Sins Of The Father"" on her back. Zane finally breaks through and kills the woman, but when barricading themselves in a room, the woman appears and knocks Zane unconscious. Laura returns with Lester's truck and the woman is about to slaughter Laura, but disappears after seeing a tattoo that's similar to the necklace Rene had throughout the movie. Laura escapes and Rene and Zane wake to find themselves in some kind of box. The old woman quickly grabs the necklace and drops the gold ring taken by the caretaker in the beginning of the movie. Rene and Zane scream in fear as the old woman buries them alive."

Kumar takes Vaishali to a country manor in France. She does not know French or English. Kumar already has a French first wife Lucy  living there on the top floor. He deceives both wives. He tells Vaishali that Lucy is a friend, while he tells Lucy that Vaishali is his sister. Eventually, Vaishali figures out his bigamy and does not want to stay with him as his second wife. She does not know of anyone who knows her language and who can help her escape Kumar. Kumar tortures and threatens her to make her act as his mentally deranged sister. He treats her in a very sadistic manner. A desi pickpocket  sees Kumar abusing Vaishali and tells her about an Indian doctor named Shanker  who can help her. In the mean time, Vaishali becomes pregnant, and Kumar is afraid that Lucy will discover his deception, so he tries to force Vaishali to have an unsafe abortion. Dr. Shanker rescues her and also tells Lucy everything about Kumar's bigamy. Lucy ends her marriage. Dr. Shanker brings Vaishali back to India, who moves back in with her brother and mother. No mention is made as to what happened to her pregnancy and no baby is seen or heard. It is presumed that she may have later had an abortion, since she did not want to be connected to her ex-husband Kumar.

Vaishali suffers from hysteria and angrily shuts out Saritha. The story is now told in flashback, when Vaishali's brother reveals to Saritha about her marriage to Kumar , consisting of only 47 days, hence the title of the film. Kumar takes Vaishali to a country manor in France. She does not know French or English. Kumar already has a French first wife Lucy  living there on the top floor. He deceives both wives. He tells Vaishali that Lucy is a friend, while he tells Lucy that Vaishali is his sister. Eventually, Vaishali figures out his bigamy and does not want to stay with him as his second wife. She does not know of anyone who knows her language and who can help her escape Kumar. Kumar tortures and threatens her to make her act as his mentally deranged sister. He treats her in a very sadistic manner. A desi pickpocket  sees Kumar abusing Vaishali and tells her about an Indian doctor named Shanker  who can help her. In the mean time, Vaishali becomes pregnant, and Kumar is afraid that Lucy will discover his deception, so he tries to force Vaishali to have an unsafe abortion. Dr. Shanker rescues her and also tells Lucy everything about Kumar's bigamy. Lucy ends her marriage. Dr. Shanker brings Vaishali back to India, who moves back in with her brother and mother. No mention is made as to what happened to her pregnancy and no baby is seen or heard. It is presumed that she may have later had an abortion, since she did not want to be connected to her ex-husband Kumar. When Saritha asks why Vaishali didn't re-marry, such as to her rescuer Dr. Shanker, Vaishali angrily replies that a woman does not always have to be married.

Conradin, an orphan, lives with his legal guardian and aunt, Augusta. She is a sadistic figure who oppresses and controls him, on the pretext that he might die because of a genetic blood disorder. His only companions are a Houdan hen called Henrietta, which he adores, and a ferret named Sredni Vashtar, which he keeps hidden in a shed at the back of the garden. Conradin reads history books about Actaken Cults, although his aunt has forbidden him to learn history. He imagines that the ferret is a bloodthirsty god, Sredni Vashtar. Inspired by his reading, he makes offerings of bloody entrails and red berries to the ferret. One day, his aunt discovers Conradin's Houdan hen and takes it away. Very distressed, Conradin begs his god Sredni Vashtar to grant him one prayer. Shortly afterwards, his aunt finds the key to the shed where the ferret lives. She goes to the shed, while Conradin waits in the house. The ferret appears in the garden with blood on its muzzle. Distressed cries from members of the household are heard. Conradin makes himself something to eat and sits in his aunt's place, at the head of the table. The film differs from the original story in a few respects. Conradin's cousin, in the original, Mrs. De Ropp, becomes his Aunt Augusta. Also a tutor, who teaches Conradin Latin, is introduced.

2706589In Los Angeles, California, on January 15, 1947, police officers Dwight 'Bucky' Bleichert  and Lee Blanchard , investigate the murder of Elizabeth Short . As he is investigating, Bucky learns that Elizabeth was an aspiring actress, although she had not had any big breaks in her career. However, Elizabeth had become desperate for money and was paid to make a ""stag"" film with a friend of hers, Lorna Mertz. Through questioning a former roommate of Elizabeth, Bucky is told that Elizabeth liked to hang out with ""sisters"" or lesbians. He goes to a lesbian nightclub and meets a woman, Madeleine Linscott , who looks like Elizabeth. She tells him that she knew Elizabeth well, but because she is from a prominent family, she insists that her name be kept out the papers. In exchange for his silence, she promises him sexual favors and the two sleep together. Through his own investigation of the murder, Lee becomes obsessed with the case and trying to track the killer. His obsession leads him to become erratic and slightly abusive towards his longtime girlfriend Katherine 'Kay' Lake , who is also close friends with Bucky. Through his relations with Madeleine, he meets her father, Emmett Linscott, her mother, Ramona, who is addicted to prescription medication, and her sister, Martha. A few days later, after having an argument with Lee about an old case, Lee and Bucky have a fight and Bucky leaves. He later goes to Kay and Lee's home looking for him, only to find him gone. He questions Kay as to where he is and she confesses that there was a tip about a drug deal occurring with a recently released convict, Bobby DeWitt, that Lee had helped send to jail. Bucky goes to the location of the drug deal, and is involved with an altercation with Bobby DeWitt on the main stairs in the atrium of the building. Bobby gets away, and Bucky chases him up the stairs, only to find Bobby shot to death. Bucky looks up to see that it was Lee, standing on the stairs across the lobby, who had murdered Bobby. Bucky sees a shadowed figure holding a rope sneak up behind Lee, and Bucky calls out to warn him. However, the shadowed man is able to wrap his rope around Lee's neck, but Lee fights back until they are both backed up against the railing of the stairs. Bucky is in shock and is unable to help Lee. As Lee continues to struggle, another shadowed figure walks up to Lee and the man with the rope and slits Lee's neck, causing both men to fall over the railing and onto a fountain several floors below, leading to the death of both. While dealing with the grief of losing Lee, Kay and Bucky sleep together and begin dating. Bucky is still intent on solving Elizabeth's murder, along with Lee's, and his search for answers leads him to an old housing site that Madeleine's father helped build. In one of the houses, Bucky sees the set that was used to film the porn movie that Elizabeth was in. Bucky also finds a barn on the property, which is below the Hollywoodland sign and a drawing of a man with a Glasgow smile drawn on the wall with blood. It is also the picture that Madeleine has in her parents' house, and is also the same smile that was carved into Elizabeth's face during her murder. Bucky then accuses Madeleine's father Emmett ([[John Kavanagh  and Madeleine of murdering Elizabeth. However, Madeleine's mother Ramona  reveals that she was the one to kill Elizabeth, one of the reasons being that she looked so much like her Madeleine. A few moments after her confession, Ramona kills herself in front of Bucky, Madeleine, and Emmett. A few days later, Bucky goes to the Linscott's house again, and after speaking with Madeleine's sister, he discovers that it was Madeleine who had murdered Lee, as Lee was trying blackmail her father, as he was desperate for money. Bucky finds Madeleine at a motel, and although she insists that he won't shoot her because he would rather have sex with her, he tells her she is wrong and shoots her dead. Bucky later goes to Kay's house, and when she opens the door he sees a crow chirping by Elizabeth's body on the front lawn, then realizes that it was only a hallucination. Kay tells him to come in and closes the door as the film ends.

10825522Although he aspires to be an artist, middle class Charles Ryder is studying history at the University of Oxford, where he befriends wealthy Lord Sebastian Flyte, a flamboyant homosexual and alcoholic. Sebastian's family, the noble Marchmains, strongly disapprove of both proclivities. When Sebastian takes him home to visit his nanny, Charles is enthralled by the grandeur of the Marchmain family estate, known as Brideshead, and he is entranced by its residents, including the devout Catholic Lady Marchmain and her other children, Sebastian's elder brother Bridey and his younger sisters Julia and Cordelia. When Lord Marchmain invites Sebastian and Julia to visit him and his mistress Cara in Venice, Lady Marchmain encourages Charles to accompany them in the hope he can be a positive influence on her son. Increasingly interested in Julia, Charles surreptitiously kisses her in a dark alley, unaware Sebastian is watching from the opposite side of the canal. Jealous of his attention to his sibling, Sebastian ends their friendship. On their return to England, Lady Marchmain makes it clear Charles cannot marry her daughter since he professes to be an atheist. Sebastian's allowance is rescinded by his mother, who is concerned about his increasing alcoholism. During a visit to Brideshead, Ryder gives Sebastian money, which he uses to purchase alcohol. When he arrives drunk and improperly dressed at a ball celebrating Julia's engagement to Canadian Rex Mottram, Lady Marchmain blames Charles and tells him he no longer is welcome at Brideshead. Sebastian flees to Morocco where, at the request of the now terminally ill Lady Marchmain, Charles finds him hospitalised. His plan to bring him home is disrupted when the doctor warns him Sebastian is too ill to travel. Years later, Charles - now married and a successful painter - reunites with Julia on an ocean liner en route to England from New York. They realize they are still in love and decide to leave their respective spouses and live together in Italy.

Rex agrees to the proposal in exchange for two of Charles' paintings, an arrangement that shocks and angers Julia, who feels like bartered goods. Without warning, a dying Lord Marchmain and Cara arrive at Brideshead so he can spend his final days in his former home. On his deathbed Lord Marchmain, hitherto an atheist, regains his faith and dies a reconciled Catholic. Deeply affected by her father's transformation, Julia decides she cannot relinquish her faith to marry Charles, and the two part. Several years later, during World War II, Charles - now a disillusioned army captain - finds himself once again at Brideshead, which has been requisitioned by the army for a military base. A corporal tells him Julia is serving in the reserves and her elder brother was killed during The Blitz. In the movie's final scene, Charles visits the family chapel, where he finds a single lit candle. He dips his hand in holy water and is about to snuff out the candle between his fingers, but he changes his mind and leaves the flame burning.

Ho spots Mark during one of his shifts; in contrast to Mark's letters, he realizes in horror that Mark has been reduced to an errand boy and janitor for Shing . During an emotional reunion, Mark asks Ho to return to his underworld lifestyle to take revenge on Shing and reclaim their positions in the organization, but Ho refuses. Ho seeks Kit out and attempts to reconcile with his brother , but is rebuffed by Kit, who sees Ho as nothing but an criminal who is responsible for their father's death. Additionally, Kit is resentful that his familial tie to Ho is preventing him from advancement in the department. In an effort to prove himself to his superiors and further distance himself from the stigma of his brother's criminal past, Kit becomes obsessed with bringing down Shing's criminal group, despite Ho's warnings to stay away from the dangerous case. Shing finds Ho and presses him to come back to his organization, offering to reinstate Mark if he returns. Ho flatly refuses. Consequently, Shing begins harassing and threatening Ho in order to get him to return, including attacking his co-workers at the taxi company, and having Mark beaten severely.

Ho and Mark steal incriminating evidence from the counterfeiting business and use it to ransom Shing in exchange for money and an escape boat. However, Ho has given the evidence to Kit's girlfriend to hand to the police. Using Shing as a hostage, Ho and Mark take the money to a pier, intending to escape in the boat. It is revealed that it was Shing who betrayed Ho three years ago in Taiwan. Meanwhile, acting on his earlier information, Kit arrives on the scene intending to make an arrest but is captured by Shing's men. Even though he is free to escape, Ho decides to return to save Kit and asks Mark to leave on his own. Ho returns and offers to exchange Shing for Kit, but the trade explodes into a wild shootout. Ho and Kit are wounded and pinned down, but saved by Mark, who turned the boat around out of loyalty to Ho. After killing many of Shing's men, Mark berates Kit, telling him that Ho's actions had atoned for whatever wrongdoings he had done in the past. Mark is in turn killed by Shing. As the police approach, Shing mocks Ho , stating that his money and power will ensure his swift release. Kit, finally seeing eye to eye with his brother, hands Ho a loaded revolver, with which Ho kills Shing. Immediately afterwards, Ho handcuffs himself to Kit, expressing his desire for redemption and his admiration that Kit always walked the right path. Kit smiles tearfully. Now reconciled, the brothers walk together towards the gathered crowd of police.
1221565Gynecologist Dr. Alex Hesse  has a nightmare about urinating infants in a library. In the real world, he and his colleague Dr. Larry Arbogast  have invented a fertility drug, ""Expectane"", that is supposed to reduce the chances of a woman's body rejecting an embryo and thus prevent a miscarriage. Unfortunately, they are not allowed to test it on women since the Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved the drug; so Hesse and Arbogast move forward in their research. In response, Hesse breaks into the laboratory and locks himself in. The head of the review board, Noah Banes, informs Arbogast that while the FDA has denied their team the right of human experimentation, the team has managed to receive a donation by Dr. Diana Reddin  from the ovum cryogenics department. When Hesse questions the chances of a woman taking an unapproved drug during pregnancy, Arbogast reveals that there is no need to identify the gender of the experiment and convinces Hesse to impregnate himself, using an ovum codenamed ""Junior"". That night, Hesse has another nightmare in which his potential offspring has his own face pasted onto it. That day, he complains to Arbogast that his nipples are hurting him. Later, the normally aloof Hesse inexplicably lightens up and chats incessantly about walks, massages, and naps. Reddin tells Hesse that being a woman is not as great as it sounds, citing the menstrual cycles which do not stop until menopause, while Arbogast warns Hesse of a disease that is turning men into strudels. Meanwhile, Arbogast's pregnant ex-wife wants him to be the doctor delivering her baby. Hesse begins to wonder what it would be like to be a father and watches some television commercials to have himself a good sobbing. He later begins overeating, with Arbogast's ex-wife noting his practice of ""mixing cuisines"". It is revealed that the ""Junior"" ovum is actually from Reddin's own body, making her the mother of Hesse's child. Banes wants to take credit for the experiment despite having no role in it. Arbogast disguises Hesse as a woman and hides him in a retreat for expecting mothers outside the city, passing off his masculine appearance as past anabolic steroid use. Eventually, Hesse goes into labor  and gives birth via caesarean section to a baby girl naming her Junior. Arbogast delivers his ex-wife's child and the two reconcile to raise their new son as their own. Before the credits, it shows the two families on a beach on vacation celebrating the birthdays of Junior and Jake , we discover that Reddin is pregnant and when the credits are rolling, they are all playing in the sea.

12607320In 1660, Charles Stuart , deposed as king of England by Oliver Cromwell and the Roundheads, is in exile in the Netherlands with a few loyalists, awaiting the right opportunity to return. Whilst bartering in a local marketplace, he meets Katie , a Dutch farm owner and flower seller. When unrest in England presents both opportunity and danger, Charles's chief advisor, Sir Edward Hyde , recommends he hide somewhere, neither too close for Roundhead assassins to find him, nor too far for news to reach him of further developments. Charles, without revealing his royal identity, persuades Katie to take him on as a farm hand. The two soon fall in love. During his stay, Charles encounters an actor named Dick Pinner  who is posing as him; the imposter stays at Katie's inn. Shortly afterward, there arrives another guest, Countess Anbella de Courteuil , an old lover of Charles's and an emissary from King Louis of France. She presents Charles with a gift from Louis, a music box. Knowing that Katie owes 3000 guilders to her cousin, Jan , Charles has the music box sold and pays off the debt without her knowledge. Katie becomes jealous of Anbella and dismisses Charles. However, when she learns of his generosity from a gracious, departing Anbella, she takes him back. Meanwhile, English Colonel Ingram  has been given the mission of assassinating the king. He tracks Charles to his hiding place. Charles escapes from Ingram's men, but they follow Katie and trap him in a windmill. After a swordfight, he kills Ingram, and his followers come to the rescue. Sir Edward informs him that Parliament has offered him back his throne. To take the crown, however, Charles has to leave Katie; Charles resists the idea, but Sir Edward reminds him of his duty, and Katie of what he can do for his people, and the two star-crossed lovers sadly part. The film's original ending, preferred by Ophüls, was a bit longer than the one shown in the United States. The shorter version ends with Charles leaving for England, while the longer has a further scene in which two courtiers casually discuss a plaque that is erected to his stay.
2578654Soe Hok Gie grew up in a lower-middle class Chinese Indonesian family in Jakarta. In his early teens, young Gie had developed a fascination in concepts and idealisms advocated by world class intellectuals. Combined with a fighter's passion, faithfulness to friends, and a heart filled with genuine care for others and for his country, young Gie grew to become intolerant with injustice, and dreamt of an Indonesia that is truly founded on justice, equality, and righteousness. This passion was frequently misunderstood by others. Even Soe's best friends, Tan Tjin Han and Herman Lantang posed the question ""What is all this fighting for?"" which Soe would calmly respond with his awareness that freedom has a price tag that must be paid. Soe's motto, as written on the movie poster, is translated as ""It is better to be singled out than to surrender to hypocrisy"". Soe's teen and college years was spent under the regime of Indonesia's founding father Sukarno, which was characterised with conflict between the military and the Indonesian Communist Party. Soe and his friends insisted that they were politically neutral; and as much as Soe has respect for Sukarno as Indonesia's founding father, Soe detested Sukarno's dictatorship which caused the poor and the oppressed to suffer. Soe was well aware of the social inequality, power abuse, and corruption under the government of Sukarno, and courageously spoke out against it in discussion groups, student unions, and wrote sharp criticisms in the media. Soe also abhorred the fact that too many students appeared to others as advocates of positive change, who in fact were just taking advantage of the political situation to make personal gain. This attracted much sympathy as well as opposition. Many interest groups sought Soe to support their campaigns, while many enemies of Soe jump at any opportunity to intimidate him. Tan, Soe's childhood friend, had always deeply admired Soe's prudence and courage but lacked that fighter's spirit himself. In their twenties, the boys were reunited again for a short time. Soe finds out that Tan had become seduced and deeply involved with the PKI but was ignorant as to what this implied or what consequences awaited. Soe urges Tan to relinquish his ties with the PKI and hide out, but Tan did not listen. Soe and his friends spend their leisure time hiking and enjoy nature with the Nature-Loving Students of the University of Indonesia . Other things they enjoyed doing included watching and analysing movies, attending traditional Indonesian performing arts, and hanging out at parties.
1749535{{Plot}} Los Angeles detectives Graham Waters  and his partner Ria  approach a crime scene investigation. Ria and Kim Lee, an Asian woman in another car, get into an argument about right-of-way and soon are exchanging racial insults. Waters exits the car to check out the scene. One day prior, Farhad , a Persian shop owner, and his daughter, Dorri , argue with each other in front of a gun store owner as Farhad tries to buy a revolver. The shop keeper grows impatient and orders an infuriated Farhad outside while making a racist comment. Dorri defiantly finishes the gun purchase, which she had opposed. The purchase entitles the buyer to one box of ammunition. She selects a red box. In another part of town, Rick Cabot , the local district attorney, and his wife, Jean , are carjacked as they are about to enter their Lincoln Navigator, by Anthony  and Peter . Later, at the Cabot house, Hispanic locksmith Daniel Ruiz  is changing their locks when he overhears Jean complaining about having been carjacked earlier by two black men and now having to endure a heavily tattooed Hispanic with a shaved head changing their locks, because she is sure he is going to leave and give copies of the new keys to ""his other gang members."" Detectives Waters and Ria next arrive at the scene of a shooting between two drivers. The surviving shooter is a white male, identified as an undercover police officer. The dead shooter, a black male, is revealed also to be an undercover police officer. There is a large amount of cash found in the black officer's trunk. This is the third time the white officer has shot and killed a black man. LAPD officer John Ryan  and his partner, Tom Hanson , begin their evening patrol. They pull over a Navigator similar to the one carjacked earlier, despite discrepancies in the descriptions of the carjackers and in the license plate numbers. They order the couple, TV director Cameron Thayer  and his wife Christine , to exit. Cameron is cooperative, but Christine has had a few drinks and is argumentative. This annoys Ryan, who sexually molests Christine under the pretense of administering a pat-down; intimidated, Cameron says nothing. The couple is released without a citation. Once home, Christine becomes enraged that Cameron did nothing while she was being violated. Cameron insists that what he did was correct and storms out. Arriving home from work long after dark, Daniel finds his young daughter, Lara, hiding under her bed after hearing a gunshot outside. To comfort her, Daniel gives her an ""invisible impenetrable cloak,"" which makes her feel safe enough to fall asleep in her bed. In the carjacked SUV, Anthony and Peter, arguing and distracted, hit something while passing a parked white van. Stopping, they discover that they have run over an Asian man, now trapped under the SUV. They argue about what to do with him, finally dumping him in front of a hospital and driving away. The next day, at the LAPD station, Hanson talks to his superior, Lt. Dixon , about switching partners. Dixon, a black man, claims that Hanson's charge of Ryan as a racist could cost both Hanson and Dixon their jobs. Dixon suggests a transfer to a one-man car and mockingly tells Hanson that he should justify it by claiming to have uncontrollable flatulence. Ryan visits Shaniqua Johnson , a ""managed care"" insurance representative with whom he argued earlier. Apologizing for insulting her previously, he explains that his father was previously diagnosed with a bladder infection but he fears the diagnosis is incorrect and that it may be prostate cancer. Ryan wants him to see a different doctor, but Shaniqua icily informs him that the health plan won't cover it. Daniel is seen replacing a lock at Farhad's shop and tries to explain to him that the door frame is shattered and not secure and needs to be replaced. Farhad, whose English is limited, misunderstands and accuses Daniel of cheating him and refuses to pay. The next morning, Farhad discovers the store has been looted, wrecked and tagged with graffiti. His insurance company does not cover the damage, calling it a case of negligence, as he had been advised to replace the door and did not. Farhad looks for and finds Daniel's full name on the discarded invoice and vows revenge. Detective Waters visits his mother, a some-time hard drug abuser. She asks him to find his missing younger brother; he promises and takes notice that there is almost no food in the apartment as he is leaving. In the studio where Cameron works, a white producer, Fred , suggests that a black actor isn't acting ""black"" enough, as he was using proper grammar. Cameron had been satisfied with the take just completed, but Fred strongly suggests that another take be done, with the black actor speaking more ""black."" Cameron initially pushes back but, threatened with his job, he concedes. Ryan comes across a car accident and as he crawls into the overturned vehicle, he finds Christine, who is trapped. Upon recognizing Ryan, Christine becomes hysterical, screaming for him to leave her alone and refusing his help, but gasoline is leaking from the tank and running downhill towards another wreck, which has already caught fire. He calms her down, and with the assistance of his partner and spectators, Ryan pulls Christine out just as her car bursts into flames. A confused but grateful Christine is taken away by EMTs. Anthony and Peter attempt to carjack Cameron. Cameron has reached his limit of being pushed around, and he resists the attempt. Peter asks Anthony to shoot Cameron even though he had earlier claimed that he would never rob another black man but Anthony does not. As police officers arrive, Cameron jumps back in the car and drives away, with Anthony continuing to hold a gun on him. A car chase ensues; one of the police responders to the chase is Tom Hanson, who recognizes the vehicle as the one he and Ryan pulled over the night before. Cameron drives to a dead end, grabs Anthony's gun, and gets out of the car, all the while yelling insults at the officers. Just before he pulls out the gun, Hanson convinces him to stop aggravating the situation and just go home. Hanson vouches for Cameron to the other officers, telling them that Cameron has no prior history of breaking the law and promises to give him a ""harsh warning."" All depart. Cameron tells Anthony that as a black man he is embarrassed for him and gives back the gun as he drops Anthony at a bus stop. Using the White Pages of the phone book, Farhad locates Daniel's home address and travels there with his gun. As Daniel's wife Elizabeth  watches in horror, Farhad shoots at Daniel at point-blank range -- just as Daniel's daughter Lara jumps into his arms to protect her father with the ""invisible cloak."" It takes the grief-stricken parents a moment to realize that Lara is miraculously unharmed; the red box of ammunition that Dorri had selected contained blanks, rendering Farhad's gun harmless. Farhad later tells his daughter that he believes that the little girl was his angel, saving him from committing a terrible crime. Peter, who is hitchhiking, is picked up by Hanson. They awkwardly try to bridge the gap between their cultures. Peter sees that Hanson has a small statuette of Saint Christopher, which he also has. He begins to laugh as he realizes that there is no difference between the two of them, but Hanson thinks that he is being racist. Peter then pulls his statuette out of his pocket, but Hanson thinks it is a gun and shoots and kills Peter. Hanson dumps the body and then torches his own car in another part of town. Peter is revealed to be Waters' missing brother. Waters and his mother meet up at the morgue, and Waters promises to find who is responsible. His mother tells him not to bother, as she blames him for his brother's death. Anthony returns to the white van owned by the Asian man that they had run over earlier. Finding the keys still hanging from the door lock, he drives the van away. Kim Lee  arrives at a hospital looking for her husband Choi Jin Gui, the man Anthony and Peter ran over. Conscious and coherent, he tells her to go and immediately cash a check that he has in his wallet. Anthony has driven the white van to a chop shop he frequents, and as they inspect the van, a number of Asian immigrants are discovered to be chained and locked in the back of the van, revealing that Choi was, in fact, involved in human trafficking. Anthony is offered $500 for each person in the van. The last scene of the film shows the white van being parked in Chinatown, where Anthony walks to the back, opens the van, and sets the Asians free. He tells the uncomprehending passengers that ""this is America,"" and he gives $40 to one of the men, telling him to buy everyone some ""chop suey"" to eat. As Anthony drives away, he passes a minor crash, which turns out to involve Shaniqua. The film closes as Shaniqua and the other driver, who rear-ended her car, hurl racial insults at one another.

28084941A group of people in a California desert are gathered to watch a ""film."" A sheriff, Chad, points out that many moments in cinema happen for ""no reason,"" that life is full of this ""no reason,"" and that this film  is an homage to ""no reason."" An accountant then passes out binoculars to the group and rides off on a bicycle. The spectators then start looking through their binoculars into the distance, waiting for the ""film"" to start. Throughout the film, this group of people is returned to in order to gauge their reactions to what has taken place so far. In the late 90's, somewhere in the California desert, a tire suddenly comes to life and embarks on a killing spree. At first, it learns how to stand upright and then how to roll. It comes across a plastic water bottle and after hesitating, crushes it. It then comes across a scorpion and crushes it. It then comes across a glass beer bottle but is unable to crush it by rolling over it. It then starts to vibrate intensely and psychokinetically causes the bottle to fracture. It then induces a tin can, a rabbit, and a crow to explode. The tire  then sees a woman drive by and attempts to use its powers on her. However, it only succeeds in making her car stall. As the tire begins to roll towards her stalled car, a truck comes by and runs the tire over. This breaks the connection, allowing the woman's car to start again, and she continues on her way.

However, when the tire destroys the mannequin's head the dynamite does not explode. Enraged, Chad shoots and kills the tire with a shotgun. After Chad leaves, the tire is suddenly reincarnated as a small tricycle. After killing the last audience member , the tricycle recruits several tires and rolls to Hollywood, where the film concludes.
358684A clan of bandits, led by the incompetent Abis Mal, return to their hideout, only to have the brunt of their loot taken by Aladdin and Abu. Aladdin distributes the treasure amongst the poor of Agrabah - with the exception of a jewel flower, which Aladdin gives to Jasmine. Meanwhile, in the desert, Iago manages to dig himself and Jafar's genie lamp out of the sand, where they were exiled by the Genie. Jafar orders Iago to release him, but Iago rebels against Jafar and throws the lamp into a nearby well. He returns to Agrabah, hoping to gain favor with Aladdin, in order to return to the palace. When he encounters Aladdin, his claim of being a slave under hypnosis does not fare well and is pursued. Aladdin runs into Abis Mal and his bandits, but is inadvertently rescued by Iago. Aladdin returns to the palace and jails Iago, promising to allow a fair trial. He and Jasmine are greeted by the Genie, who has returned from seeing the world and is content with staying with his friends. At a special dinner held in Aladdin's honor, the Sultan announces that he wants to make Aladdin his new grand vizier. Trying to draw on the good mood, Aladdin attempts to persuade the Sultan to forgive Iago, but Iago inadvertently ruins the dinner when Rajah chases him into the room. The Sultan and Jasmine are furious at Aladdin, and Jasmine leaves the room heartbroken that Aladdin did not trust even her about this. With Iago's help, though, Jasmine eventually reconciles with Aladdin. While Abis Mal is washing himself at a well, he finds Jafar's lamp and when it is rubbed, Jafar appears as an abominable genie. Although bound by the laws of obedience, Jafar manipulates his master into wasting his first two wishes, but forms an alliance to the end of exacting revenge upon Aladdin. The pair travel to Agrabah, where Jafar reveals himself to Iago and coerces him into complying with his schemes. The next day, Aladdin and the Sultan depart to have a discussion about Iago's fate, while Jafar confronts the Genie and Abu in the Palace gardens and imprisons them. When Aladdin makes good progress with his discussions with the sultan, he is ambushed by Abis Mal, who is supported by Jafar's sorcery. The Sultan is kidnapped and Aladdin thrown into the raging river. Jafar frames Aladdin for the alleged murder of the sultan by leaving fake evidence and disguises himself as Jasmine to implicate Aladdin. Aladdin is thrown into the dungeon, to be executed by beheading come morning. In the dungeon, Iago chooses to side with Aladdin's friends by releasing the Genie to save Aladdin. Once everyone is freed, Aladdin decides to destroy Jafar, which could only occur by destroying his lamp. Jafar and Abis Mal celebrate Aladdin's death, but Jafar demands to be set free. Abis Mal hesitates, being suspicious of Jafar's motives. Aladdin attempts to steal the lamp, but is discovered and is blown out of the throne room and into the palace garden by Jafar. Aladdin, Jasmine, the Genie, Abu and Carpet engage Jafar in combat, but even when bound by the rules of the Genie, he easily outmatches them, using his tremendous powers to stop them from obtaining the lamp. His indiscriminate use of power opens a fissure in the ground which is filled with magma. Thoroughly trapped, Aladdin, Jasmine, the Genie, and Abu face certain death when suddenly Iago reappears and grabs the lamp. Jafar blasts him, leaving him for dead, but Iago manages to recover and uses his last ounce of strength to kick the lamp into the magma. The lamp is destroyed, along with Jafar. Iago recovers from his injuries, since a genie cannot kill. Aladdin announces to the Sultan that he is not yet ready to become a grand vizier, because he first wants to see the world. Jasmine declares that she will join him, but Iago objects to this and continues to rant as the film ends.

The protagonist is Jack McAuliffe , an idealistic and naive ""true believer"" who was recruited from Yale by his crew coach. Jack begins his career stationed in Berlin to work with Harvey Torriti , who is codenamed ""the Sorcerer."" Torriti takes Jack under his wing, and the two keep in touch even after Jack's career takes him from Berlin. A string of failed missions from Berlin to the Bay of Pigs Invasion forces Jack to conclude that the CIA has been severely penetrated by a KGB mole. The miniseries centers on the efforts of Jack and Harvey, along with the increasingly paranoid counterintelligence chief James Angleton , to expose and destroy the mole. Angleton becomes so paranoid, according to some of his staff, that he is forced to retire when he argues that evidence apparently clearing a suspected mole was actually incriminating evidence because it was too easily discovered. But at the end of the movie Angleton is proven right about the mole. At his farewell of the CIA he also mentions some other top KGB-agents in the world, the West German Chancellor Willy Brandt, US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and the Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme. Reruns of the first episode, immediately after it premiered on 5 August 2007, were heavily edited by the TNT network, due to commercial breaks that were not included with the first run.

24067673Anxious to help boost the career of her aspiring actress sister Eileen, reporter Ruth Sherwood of the Columbus Courier writes a rave review about her performance in a local play before it opens. When Eileen is replaced on opening night and the newspaper mistakenly runs the inaccurate review, Ruth is fired. Grandma Sherwood urges Ruth to move to New York City and Eileen decides to go with her. Relying solely on $100 given to them by their father Walter for financial support, the girls are forced to rent a dingy basement studio apartment in a Greenwich Village building owned by Mr. Appopolous. Their first day there is disturbed by workmen blasting to build a subway tunnel, passing drunkards harassing them through their windows, and Officer Lonigan, who warns them to stop causing disturbances. The following day, Eileen meets reporter Chic Clark at the Wallace Theatrical Production office, while Ruth seeks employment at Manhatter, where she has an argument with magazine owner Ralph Craven and leaves in a huff. Editor Robert Baker finds the manuscript she accidentally left behind in an envelope bearing her home address, and he decides to deliver it to her. Meanwhile, Ruth arrives home to discover Eileen has invited drugstore clerk Frank Lippincott to dinner. When an inebriated man searching for previous tenant Effie Shelton starts creating trouble, Eileen asks their neighbor, football player Wreck Loomis, to throw him out. Wreck asks if he can stay with the girls while his mother-in-law Mrs. Wade visits because she still does not know her daughter Helen is married. Frank arrives for dinner, followed in quick succession by Chic, Wreck, a man carrying the unconscious Effie, and Robert, who tells Ruth he wants to discuss her manuscript. They go to a nearby restaurant, where he encourages her to write about her eccentric life.

23616834The cartoon opens with a town of Hicksville preparing to welcome Miss Glory. In a nearby hotel, a bellhop, Abner, is anxiously awaiting her arrival, and has prepared for it, but falls asleep while waiting. As he ""sleeps"", he enters a dream sequence whereupon the hotel ends up morphing into the Cosmopolitan Hotel, an upscale big city hotel, with Abner morphing into a bellboy at the same. A man arrives and asks the now grown-up bellboy to deliver a message to Miss Glory, who is staying at that hotel. At this point, a band begins singing, with Abner the bellboy joining in singing ""Page Miss Glory"" . The distinct pronunciation in how the bellboy says ""Glory"" as ""Glore-EE"" is loosely based upon the bellboy character in the Philip Morris cigarette advertisements on radio and later television who always called out for ""Phil-ip More-Iss"" as he made his way through a hotel. That character was played by Johnny Roventini for nearly 40 years. The bellboy eventually ""meets"" someone who he thinks is Miss Glory, but makes the mistake of standing on the train of her dress, ripping it off just as she crosses behind a potted plant. This woman then takes two large leaves off the same plant and begins performing a fan dance, oblivious to the fact that others are watching her dancing for a while. Eventually, the presence of ""Miss Glory"" is announced over the hotel's PA system, with everyone in the hotel apparently recognizing who Miss Glory is. Abner, in his rush to try to see her, is unable to get into any elevator for a while everyone else rushes, and eventually the bellboy brings back one of the elevators by turning its arrow, only for the elevator operator to then refuse to take him up. While ""Miss Glory"" is performing in the upper floors of the hotel , the boy is trying to figure out how to work the elevator, but ends up ""knocked"" out of the building and in front of a streetcar, which actually turns out to be the local hotel manager in Hicksville awakening Abner from his dream sequence to tell him that Miss Glory has indeed arrived—who turns out to be a young prepubescent girl, with Abner taken aback.

As he is investigating, Bucky learns that Elizabeth was an aspiring actress, although she had not had any big breaks in her career. However, Elizabeth had become desperate for money and was paid to make a ""stag"" film with a friend of hers, Lorna Mertz. Through questioning a former roommate of Elizabeth, Bucky is told that Elizabeth liked to hang out with ""sisters"" or lesbians. He goes to a lesbian nightclub and meets a woman, Madeleine Linscott , who looks like Elizabeth. She tells him that she knew Elizabeth well, but because she is from a prominent family, she insists that her name be kept out the papers. In exchange for his silence, she promises him sexual favors and the two sleep together. Through his own investigation of the murder, Lee becomes obsessed with the case and trying to track the killer. His obsession leads him to become erratic and slightly abusive towards his longtime girlfriend Katherine 'Kay' Lake , who is also close friends with Bucky. Through his relations with Madeleine, he meets her father, Emmett Linscott, her mother, Ramona, who is addicted to prescription medication, and her sister, Martha. A few days later, after having an argument with Lee about an old case, Lee and Bucky have a fight and Bucky leaves. He later goes to Kay and Lee's home looking for him, only to find him gone. He questions Kay as to where he is and she confesses that there was a tip about a drug deal occurring with a recently released convict, Bobby DeWitt, that Lee had helped send to jail. Bucky goes to the location of the drug deal, and is involved with an altercation with Bobby DeWitt on the main stairs in the atrium of the building. Bobby gets away, and Bucky chases him up the stairs, only to find Bobby shot to death. Bucky looks up to see that it was Lee, standing on the stairs across the lobby, who had murdered Bobby. Bucky sees a shadowed figure holding a rope sneak up behind Lee, and Bucky calls out to warn him. However, the shadowed man is able to wrap his rope around Lee's neck, but Lee fights back until they are both backed up against the railing of the stairs. Bucky is in shock and is unable to help Lee. As Lee continues to struggle, another shadowed figure walks up to Lee and the man with the rope and slits Lee's neck, causing both men to fall over the railing and onto a fountain several floors below, leading to the death of both. While dealing with the grief of losing Lee, Kay and Bucky sleep together and begin dating. Bucky is still intent on solving Elizabeth's murder, along with Lee's, and his search for answers leads him to an old housing site that Madeleine's father helped build. In one of the houses, Bucky sees the set that was used to film the porn movie that Elizabeth was in. Bucky also finds a barn on the property, which is below the Hollywoodland sign and a drawing of a man with a Glasgow smile drawn on the wall with blood. It is also the picture that Madeleine has in her parents' house, and is also the same smile that was carved into Elizabeth's face during her murder. Bucky then accuses Madeleine's father Emmett ([[John Kavanagh  and Madeleine of murdering Elizabeth. However, Madeleine's mother Ramona  reveals that she was the one to kill Elizabeth, one of the reasons being that she looked so much like her Madeleine. A few moments after her confession, Ramona kills herself in front of Bucky, Madeleine, and Emmett. A few days later, Bucky goes to the Linscott's house again, and after speaking with Madeleine's sister, he discovers that it was Madeleine who had murdered Lee, as Lee was trying blackmail her father, as he was desperate for money. Bucky finds Madeleine at a motel, and although she insists that he won't shoot her because he would rather have sex with her, he tells her she is wrong and shoots her dead. Bucky later goes to Kay's house, and when she opens the door he sees a crow chirping by Elizabeth's body on the front lawn, then realizes that it was only a hallucination. Kay tells him to come in and closes the door as the film ends.

10825522Although he aspires to be an artist, middle class Charles Ryder is studying history at the University of Oxford, where he befriends wealthy Lord Sebastian Flyte, a flamboyant homosexual and alcoholic. Sebastian's family, the noble Marchmains, strongly disapprove of both proclivities. When Sebastian takes him home to visit his nanny, Charles is enthralled by the grandeur of the Marchmain family estate, known as Brideshead, and he is entranced by its residents, including the devout Catholic Lady Marchmain and her other children, Sebastian's elder brother Bridey and his younger sisters Julia and Cordelia. When Lord Marchmain invites Sebastian and Julia to visit him and his mistress Cara in Venice, Lady Marchmain encourages Charles to accompany them in the hope he can be a positive influence on her son.

1221565Gynecologist Dr. Alex Hesse  has a nightmare about urinating infants in a library. In the real world, he and his colleague Dr. Larry Arbogast  have invented a fertility drug, ""Expectane"", that is supposed to reduce the chances of a woman's body rejecting an embryo and thus prevent a miscarriage. Unfortunately, they are not allowed to test it on women since the Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved the drug; so Hesse and Arbogast move forward in their research.

12607320In 1660, Charles Stuart , deposed as king of England by Oliver Cromwell and the Roundheads, is in exile in the Netherlands with a few loyalists, awaiting the right opportunity to return. Whilst bartering in a local marketplace, he meets Katie , a Dutch farm owner and flower seller. When unrest in England presents both opportunity and danger, Charles's chief advisor, Sir Edward Hyde , recommends he hide somewhere, neither too close for Roundhead assassins to find him, nor too far for news to reach him of further developments. Charles, without revealing his royal identity, persuades Katie to take him on as a farm hand. The two soon fall in love. During his stay, Charles encounters an actor named Dick Pinner  who is posing as him; the imposter stays at Katie's inn. Shortly afterward, there arrives another guest, Countess Anbella de Courteuil , an old lover of Charles's and an emissary from King Louis of France. She presents Charles with a gift from Louis, a music box. Knowing that Katie owes 3000 guilders to her cousin, Jan , Charles has the music box sold and pays off the debt without her knowledge. Katie becomes jealous of Anbella and dismisses Charles. However, when she learns of his generosity from a gracious, departing Anbella, she takes him back. Meanwhile, English Colonel Ingram  has been given the mission of assassinating the king. He tracks Charles to his hiding place. Charles escapes from Ingram's men, but they follow Katie and trap him in a windmill. After a swordfight, he kills Ingram, and his followers come to the rescue. Sir Edward informs him that Parliament has offered him back his throne. To take the crown, however, Charles has to leave Katie; Charles resists the idea, but Sir Edward reminds him of his duty, and Katie of what he can do for his people, and the two star-crossed lovers sadly part. The film's original ending, preferred by Ophüls, was a bit longer than the one shown in the United States. The shorter version ends with Charles leaving for England, while the longer has a further scene in which two courtiers casually discuss a plaque that is erected to his stay.
2578654Soe Hok Gie grew up in a lower-middle class Chinese Indonesian family in Jakarta. In his early teens, young Gie had developed a fascination in concepts and idealisms advocated by world class intellectuals. Combined with a fighter's passion, faithfulness to friends, and a heart filled with genuine care for others and for his country, young Gie grew to become intolerant with injustice, and dreamt of an Indonesia that is truly founded on justice, equality, and righteousness. This passion was frequently misunderstood by others. Even Soe's best friends, Tan Tjin Han and Herman Lantang posed the question ""What is all this fighting for?"" which Soe would calmly respond with his awareness that freedom has a price tag that must be paid. Soe's motto, as written on the movie poster, is translated as ""It is better to be singled out than to surrender to hypocrisy"". Soe's teen and college years was spent under the regime of Indonesia's founding father Sukarno, which was characterised with conflict between the military and the Indonesian Communist Party. Soe and his friends insisted that they were politically neutral; and as much as Soe has respect for Sukarno as Indonesia's founding father, Soe detested Sukarno's dictatorship which caused the poor and the oppressed to suffer. Soe was well aware of the social inequality, power abuse, and corruption under the government of Sukarno, and courageously spoke out against it in discussion groups, student unions, and wrote sharp criticisms in the media. Soe also abhorred the fact that too many students appeared to others as advocates of positive change, who in fact were just taking advantage of the political situation to make personal gain. This attracted much sympathy as well as opposition. Many interest groups sought Soe to support their campaigns, while many enemies of Soe jump at any opportunity to intimidate him. Tan, Soe's childhood friend, had always deeply admired Soe's prudence and courage but lacked that fighter's spirit himself. In their twenties, the boys were reunited again for a short time. Soe finds out that Tan had become seduced and deeply involved with the PKI but was ignorant as to what this implied or what consequences awaited. Soe urges Tan to relinquish his ties with the PKI and hide out, but Tan did not listen. Soe and his friends spend their leisure time hiking and enjoy nature with the Nature-Loving Students of the University of Indonesia . Other things they enjoyed doing included watching and analysing movies, attending traditional Indonesian performing arts, and hanging out at parties.
1749535{{Plot}} Los Angeles detectives Graham Waters  and his partner Ria  approach a crime scene investigation. Ria and Kim Lee, an Asian woman in another car, get into an argument about right-of-way and soon are exchanging racial insults. Waters exits the car to check out the scene. One day prior, Farhad , a Persian shop owner, and his daughter, Dorri , argue with each other in front of a gun store owner as Farhad tries to buy a revolver. The shop keeper grows impatient and orders an infuriated Farhad outside while making a racist comment. Dorri defiantly finishes the gun purchase, which she had opposed. The purchase entitles the buyer to one box of ammunition. She selects a red box. In another part of town, Rick Cabot , the local district attorney, and his wife, Jean , are carjacked as they are about to enter their Lincoln Navigator, by Anthony  and Peter . Later, at the Cabot house, Hispanic locksmith Daniel Ruiz  is changing their locks when he overhears Jean complaining about having been carjacked earlier by two black men and now having to endure a heavily tattooed Hispanic with a shaved head changing their locks, because she is sure he is going to leave and give copies of the new keys to ""his other gang members."" Detectives Waters and Ria next arrive at the scene of a shooting between two drivers. The surviving shooter is a white male, identified as an undercover police officer. The dead shooter, a black male, is revealed also to be an undercover police officer. There is a large amount of cash found in the black officer's trunk. This is the third time the white officer has shot and killed a black man. LAPD officer John Ryan  and his partner, Tom Hanson , begin their evening patrol. They pull over a Navigator similar to the one carjacked earlier, despite discrepancies in the descriptions of the carjackers and in the license plate numbers. They order the couple, TV director Cameron Thayer  and his wife Christine , to exit. Cameron is cooperative, but Christine has had a few drinks and is argumentative. This annoys Ryan, who sexually molests Christine under the pretense of administering a pat-down; intimidated, Cameron says nothing. The couple is released without a citation. Once home, Christine becomes enraged that Cameron did nothing while she was being violated. Cameron insists that what he did was correct and storms out. Arriving home from work long after dark, Daniel finds his young daughter, Lara, hiding under her bed after hearing a gunshot outside. To comfort her, Daniel gives her an ""invisible impenetrable cloak,"" which makes her feel safe enough to fall asleep in her bed. In the carjacked SUV, Anthony and Peter, arguing and distracted, hit something while passing a parked white van. Stopping, they discover that they have run over an Asian man, now trapped under the SUV. They argue about what to do with him, finally dumping him in front of a hospital and driving away. The next day, at the LAPD station, Hanson talks to his superior, Lt. Dixon , about switching partners. Dixon, a black man, claims that Hanson's charge of Ryan as a racist could cost both Hanson and Dixon their jobs. Dixon suggests a transfer to a one-man car and mockingly tells Hanson that he should justify it by claiming to have uncontrollable flatulence. Ryan visits Shaniqua Johnson , a ""managed care"" insurance representative with whom he argued earlier. Apologizing for insulting her previously, he explains that his father was previously diagnosed with a bladder infection but he fears the diagnosis is incorrect and that it may be prostate cancer. Ryan wants him to see a different doctor, but Shaniqua icily informs him that the health plan won't cover it. Daniel is seen replacing a lock at Farhad's shop and tries to explain to him that the door frame is shattered and not secure and needs to be replaced. Farhad, whose English is limited, misunderstands and accuses Daniel of cheating him and refuses to pay. The next morning, Farhad discovers the store has been looted, wrecked and tagged with graffiti. His insurance company does not cover the damage, calling it a case of negligence, as he had been advised to replace the door and did not. Farhad looks for and finds Daniel's full name on the discarded invoice and vows revenge. Detective Waters visits his mother, a some-time hard drug abuser. She asks him to find his missing younger brother; he promises and takes notice that there is almost no food in the apartment as he is leaving. In the studio where Cameron works, a white producer, Fred , suggests that a black actor isn't acting ""black"" enough, as he was using proper grammar. Cameron had been satisfied with the take just completed, but Fred strongly suggests that another take be done, with the black actor speaking more ""black."" Cameron initially pushes back but, threatened with his job, he concedes. Ryan comes across a car accident and as he crawls into the overturned vehicle, he finds Christine, who is trapped. Upon recognizing Ryan, Christine becomes hysterical, screaming for him to leave her alone and refusing his help, but gasoline is leaking from the tank and running downhill towards another wreck, which has already caught fire. He calms her down, and with the assistance of his partner and spectators, Ryan pulls Christine out just as her car bursts into flames. A confused but grateful Christine is taken away by EMTs. Anthony and Peter attempt to carjack Cameron. Cameron has reached his limit of being pushed around, and he resists the attempt. Peter asks Anthony to shoot Cameron even though he had earlier claimed that he would never rob another black man but Anthony does not. As police officers arrive, Cameron jumps back in the car and drives away, with Anthony continuing to hold a gun on him. A car chase ensues; one of the police responders to the chase is Tom Hanson, who recognizes the vehicle as the one he and Ryan pulled over the night before. Cameron drives to a dead end, grabs Anthony's gun, and gets out of the car, all the while yelling insults at the officers. Just before he pulls out the gun, Hanson convinces him to stop aggravating the situation and just go home. Hanson vouches for Cameron to the other officers, telling them that Cameron has no prior history of breaking the law and promises to give him a ""harsh warning."" All depart. Cameron tells Anthony that as a black man he is embarrassed for him and gives back the gun as he drops Anthony at a bus stop. Using the White Pages of the phone book, Farhad locates Daniel's home address and travels there with his gun. As Daniel's wife Elizabeth  watches in horror, Farhad shoots at Daniel at point-blank range -- just as Daniel's daughter Lara jumps into his arms to protect her father with the ""invisible cloak."" It takes the grief-stricken parents a moment to realize that Lara is miraculously unharmed; the red box of ammunition that Dorri had selected contained blanks, rendering Farhad's gun harmless. Farhad later tells his daughter that he believes that the little girl was his angel, saving him from committing a terrible crime. Peter, who is hitchhiking, is picked up by Hanson. They awkwardly try to bridge the gap between their cultures. Peter sees that Hanson has a small statuette of Saint Christopher, which he also has. He begins to laugh as he realizes that there is no difference between the two of them, but Hanson thinks that he is being racist. Peter then pulls his statuette out of his pocket, but Hanson thinks it is a gun and shoots and kills Peter. Hanson dumps the body and then torches his own car in another part of town. Peter is revealed to be Waters' missing brother. Waters and his mother meet up at the morgue, and Waters promises to find who is responsible. His mother tells him not to bother, as she blames him for his brother's death. Anthony returns to the white van owned by the Asian man that they had run over earlier. Finding the keys still hanging from the door lock, he drives the van away. Kim Lee  arrives at a hospital looking for her husband Choi Jin Gui, the man Anthony and Peter ran over. Conscious and coherent, he tells her to go and immediately cash a check that he has in his wallet. Anthony has driven the white van to a chop shop he frequents, and as they inspect the van, a number of Asian immigrants are discovered to be chained and locked in the back of the van, revealing that Choi was, in fact, involved in human trafficking. Anthony is offered $500 for each person in the van. The last scene of the film shows the white van being parked in Chinatown, where Anthony walks to the back, opens the van, and sets the Asians free. He tells the uncomprehending passengers that ""this is America,"" and he gives $40 to one of the men, telling him to buy everyone some ""chop suey"" to eat. As Anthony drives away, he passes a minor crash, which turns out to involve Shaniqua. The film closes as Shaniqua and the other driver, who rear-ended her car, hurl racial insults at one another.

28084941A group of people in a California desert are gathered to watch a ""film."" A sheriff, Chad, points out that many moments in cinema happen for ""no reason,"" that life is full of this ""no reason,"" and that this film  is an homage to ""no reason."" An accountant then passes out binoculars to the group and rides off on a bicycle. The spectators then start looking through their binoculars into the distance, waiting for the ""film"" to start. Throughout the film, this group of people is returned to in order to gauge their reactions to what has taken place so far. In the late 90's, somewhere in the California desert, a tire suddenly comes to life and embarks on a killing spree. At first, it learns how to stand upright and then how to roll. It comes across a plastic water bottle and after hesitating, crushes it. It then comes across a scorpion and crushes it. It then comes across a glass beer bottle but is unable to crush it by rolling over it. It then starts to vibrate intensely and psychokinetically causes the bottle to fracture. It then induces a tin can, a rabbit, and a crow to explode. The tire  then sees a woman drive by and attempts to use its powers on her. However, it only succeeds in making her car stall. As the tire begins to roll towards her stalled car, a truck comes by and runs the tire over. This breaks the connection, allowing the woman's car to start again, and she continues on her way. The tire finds the man driving the truck which ran him over. Using its psychokinetic powers, the tire blows up the man's head. Settling into an obscure desert town, the tire comes across the woman in the car.

The accountant tries to end the movie early by feeding the audience a poisoned turkey, but one of them, a man in a wheelchair, does not partake and survives. Chad witnesses the tire kill the motel owner , and leads the cops on a ""tire-hunt"". Meanwhile, the accountant tries to poison the man in the wheelchair with more food, but ends up eating it himself and dying. As the tire is running from the police, it comes across a group of people burning a large pile of tires. As a result of this, the tire embarks on a large killing spree. The cops find the tire watching an auto racing program in a house, having killed the occupants. Chad rigs a mannequin  with dynamite, intending for the tire to blow the mannequin's head up, thereby detonating the dynamite and destroying itself. However, when the tire destroys the mannequin's head the dynamite does not explode. Enraged, Chad shoots and kills the tire with a shotgun. After Chad leaves, the tire is suddenly reincarnated as a small tricycle. After killing the last audience member , the tricycle recruits several tires and rolls to Hollywood, where the film concludes.
358684A clan of bandits, led by the incompetent Abis Mal, return to their hideout, only to have the brunt of their loot taken by Aladdin and Abu. Aladdin distributes the treasure amongst the poor of Agrabah - with the exception of a jewel flower, which Aladdin gives to Jasmine. Meanwhile, in the desert, Iago manages to dig himself and Jafar's genie lamp out of the sand, where they were exiled by the Genie. Jafar orders Iago to release him, but Iago rebels against Jafar and throws the lamp into a nearby well. He returns to Agrabah, hoping to gain favor with Aladdin, in order to return to the palace. When he encounters Aladdin, his claim of being a slave under hypnosis does not fare well and is pursued. Aladdin runs into Abis Mal and his bandits, but is inadvertently rescued by Iago. Aladdin returns to the palace and jails Iago, promising to allow a fair trial. He and Jasmine are greeted by the Genie, who has returned from seeing the world and is content with staying with his friends. At a special dinner held in Aladdin's honor, the Sultan announces that he wants to make Aladdin his new grand vizier. Trying to draw on the good mood, Aladdin attempts to persuade the Sultan to forgive Iago, but Iago inadvertently ruins the dinner when Rajah chases him into the room. The Sultan and Jasmine are furious at Aladdin, and Jasmine leaves the room heartbroken that Aladdin did not trust even her about this. With Iago's help, though, Jasmine eventually reconciles with Aladdin. While Abis Mal is washing himself at a well, he finds Jafar's lamp and when it is rubbed, Jafar appears as an abominable genie. Although bound by the laws of obedience, Jafar manipulates his master into wasting his first two wishes, but forms an alliance to the end of exacting revenge upon Aladdin. The pair travel to Agrabah, where Jafar reveals himself to Iago and coerces him into complying with his schemes. The next day, Aladdin and the Sultan depart to have a discussion about Iago's fate, while Jafar confronts the Genie and Abu in the Palace gardens and imprisons them. When Aladdin makes good progress with his discussions with the sultan, he is ambushed by Abis Mal, who is supported by Jafar's sorcery. The Sultan is kidnapped and Aladdin thrown into the raging river. Jafar frames Aladdin for the alleged murder of the sultan by leaving fake evidence and disguises himself as Jasmine to implicate Aladdin. Aladdin is thrown into the dungeon, to be executed by beheading come morning. In the dungeon, Iago chooses to side with Aladdin's friends by releasing the Genie to save Aladdin. Once everyone is freed, Aladdin decides to destroy Jafar, which could only occur by destroying his lamp. Jafar and Abis Mal celebrate Aladdin's death, but Jafar demands to be set free. Abis Mal hesitates, being suspicious of Jafar's motives. Aladdin attempts to steal the lamp, but is discovered and is blown out of the throne room and into the palace garden by Jafar. Aladdin, Jasmine, the Genie, Abu and Carpet engage Jafar in combat, but even when bound by the rules of the Genie, he easily outmatches them, using his tremendous powers to stop them from obtaining the lamp. His indiscriminate use of power opens a fissure in the ground which is filled with magma. Thoroughly trapped, Aladdin, Jasmine, the Genie, and Abu face certain death when suddenly Iago reappears and grabs the lamp. Jafar blasts him, leaving him for dead, but Iago manages to recover and uses his last ounce of strength to kick the lamp into the magma. The lamp is destroyed, along with Jafar. Iago recovers from his injuries, since a genie cannot kill. Aladdin announces to the Sultan that he is not yet ready to become a grand vizier, because he first wants to see the world. Jasmine declares that she will join him, but Iago objects to this and continues to rant as the film ends.

7548287The Company is an American fiction miniseries that follows the Cold War intelligence battle between the CIA and the KGB from the end of World War II to the fall of the Soviet Union. The protagonist is Jack McAuliffe , an idealistic and naive ""true believer"" who was recruited from Yale by his crew coach. Jack begins his career stationed in Berlin to work with Harvey Torriti , who is codenamed ""the Sorcerer."" Torriti takes Jack under his wing, and the two keep in touch even after Jack's career takes him from Berlin. A string of failed missions from Berlin to the Bay of Pigs Invasion forces Jack to conclude that the CIA has been severely penetrated by a KGB mole. The miniseries centers on the efforts of Jack and Harvey, along with the increasingly paranoid counterintelligence chief James Angleton , to expose and destroy the mole. Angleton becomes so paranoid, according to some of his staff, that he is forced to retire when he argues that evidence apparently clearing a suspected mole was actually incriminating evidence because it was too easily discovered. But at the end of the movie Angleton is proven right about the mole. At his farewell of the CIA he also mentions some other top KGB-agents in the world, the West German Chancellor Willy Brandt, US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and the Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme. Reruns of the first episode, immediately after it premiered on 5 August 2007, were heavily edited by the TNT network, due to commercial breaks that were not included with the first run.

24067673Anxious to help boost the career of her aspiring actress sister Eileen, reporter Ruth Sherwood of the Columbus Courier writes a rave review about her performance in a local play before it opens. When Eileen is replaced on opening night and the newspaper mistakenly runs the inaccurate review, Ruth is fired. Grandma Sherwood urges Ruth to move to New York City and Eileen decides to go with her. Relying solely on $100 given to them by their father Walter for financial support, the girls are forced to rent a dingy basement studio apartment in a Greenwich Village building owned by Mr. Appopolous. Their first day there is disturbed by workmen blasting to build a subway tunnel, passing drunkards harassing them through their windows, and Officer Lonigan, who warns them to stop causing disturbances. The following day, Eileen meets reporter Chic Clark at the Wallace Theatrical Production office, while Ruth seeks employment at Manhatter, where she has an argument with magazine owner Ralph Craven and leaves in a huff. Editor Robert Baker finds the manuscript she accidentally left behind in an envelope bearing her home address, and he decides to deliver it to her. Meanwhile, Ruth arrives home to discover Eileen has invited drugstore clerk Frank Lippincott to dinner. When an inebriated man searching for previous tenant Effie Shelton starts creating trouble, Eileen asks their neighbor, football player Wreck Loomis, to throw him out. Wreck asks if he can stay with the girls while his mother-in-law Mrs. Wade visits because she still does not know her daughter Helen is married. Frank arrives for dinner, followed in quick succession by Chic, Wreck, a man carrying the unconscious Effie, and Robert, who tells Ruth he wants to discuss her manuscript. They go to a nearby restaurant, where he encourages her to write about her eccentric life. He is delighted with the story she submits, but Ralph rejects it, prompting Robert to announce he is quitting. Back at the Sherwood apartment, Effie inadvertently reveals Helen and Wreck are married to Mrs. Wade, who is upset by the news. Ruth receives a call from Chic's editor asking her to go to Brooklyn to cover the arrival of the Portuguese Merchant Marine fleet and, delighted with the assignment, she rushes off. Unbeknownst to her, it actually was Chic who called, hoping his ruse would allow him to spend time with Eileen alone. Robert arrives, rescues Eileen from Chic's unwanted advances, and invites her and Ruth to dinner to celebrate his quitting his job. Robert leaves, and Ruth arrives with the Portuguese Merchant Marines in hot pursuit. The sisters form a Conga line to lure the sailors outside, resulting in a wild party in the street, and Eileen is arrested for disturbing the peace. The following morning, Grandma and Walter Sherwood unexpectedly arrive at the apartment. While Ruth tries to conceal Eileen's predicament from them, Wreck and Helen announce they have re-married to appease Mrs. Wade, Helen casually mentions Wreck has been living with the girls, Eileen and the Merchant Marines arrive, and their commander presents her with a medal for spending the night in jail. Horrified by this seemingly endless parade of odd characters, Mr. Sherwood insists the sisters return home immediately. While Ruth is packing, Robert arrives with a check for $250 as payment for her story, which has been published in the latest issue of Manhatter. Overjoyed, Ruth signs a six-month lease and tells her father she wants to stay in New York. Ralph offers Ruth a contract for her stories, and she agrees on the condition he will introduce Eileen to a few theatre producers. As they leave the apartment to celebrate, a trio of construction workers  drill through the floor from the new subway tunnel below.

23616834The cartoon opens with a town of Hicksville preparing to welcome Miss Glory. In a nearby hotel, a bellhop, Abner, is anxiously awaiting her arrival, and has prepared for it, but falls asleep while waiting. As he ""sleeps"", he enters a dream sequence whereupon the hotel ends up morphing into the Cosmopolitan Hotel, an upscale big city hotel, with Abner morphing into a bellboy at the same. A man arrives and asks the now grown-up bellboy to deliver a message to Miss Glory, who is staying at that hotel. At this point, a band begins singing, with Abner the bellboy joining in singing ""Page Miss Glory"" . The distinct pronunciation in how the bellboy says ""Glory"" as ""Glore-EE"" is loosely based upon the bellboy character in the Philip Morris cigarette advertisements on radio and later television who always called out for ""Phil-ip More-Iss"" as he made his way through a hotel. That character was played by Johnny Roventini for nearly 40 years. The bellboy eventually ""meets"" someone who he thinks is Miss Glory, but makes the mistake of standing on the train of her dress, ripping it off just as she crosses behind a potted plant. This woman then takes two large leaves off the same plant and begins performing a fan dance, oblivious to the fact that others are watching her dancing for a while. Eventually, the presence of ""Miss Glory"" is announced over the hotel's PA system, with everyone in the hotel apparently recognizing who Miss Glory is.

Wilhelm Furtwängler  is conducting Beethoven's 5th Symphony when yet another Allied bomb raid stops the performance. A minister in Hitler's government comes to Furtwängler's dressing room to advise him that he should go abroad, and escape the war. The film then jumps to some time after the Allied victory, and we see US General Wallace  task Major Steve Arnold  with ""getting"" Furtwängler at his denazification hearing: ""Find Wilhelm Furtwängler guilty. He represents everything that was rotten in Germany"".From film audio, 6 minutes into the film. Arnold gets an office with Lt. David Wills , a German-American Jew, and Emmaline Straube , daughter of an executed member of the German resistance. Arnold questions several musicians, many of whom know Emmaline's father and say that Furtwängler refused to give Hitler the Nazi salute. Arnold begins interrogating Furtwängler, asking why he didn't leave Germany in 1933 like so many other musicians? Why he played for Hitler's birthday? Why he played at a Nazi rally? And why his recording of Bruckner's 7th Symphony was used on the radio after Hitler's death? Arnold gets a second violinist to tell him about Furtwängler's womanizing and the conductor's professional jealousy of Herbert von Karajan. In a sub plot, Arnold is assisted by a young Jewish lieutenant from the Big Red One. The young officer begins to have sympathy for the conductor as well as for the young German girl who works as a clerk in their office. This causes friction between Arnold and his job investigating former suspected Nazis. In a voice-over, Arnold explains that Furtwängler was exonerated at the later hearings but boasts his questioning ""winged"" him. The film closes with actual footage of the real Furtwängler shaking hands with Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels after a concert. A close-up then shows the conductor surreptitiously wiping his hands with a cloth after touching the Nazi."

Ben is told that he has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer in its fourth and final stage. With a ten percent chance of survival and less than two years to live, the doctor recommends that he go into treatment immediately to give himself the best odds. Soon after leaving his doctor's office, he encounters an elderly man selling his 1973 Norton Commando motorcycle from out of his garage in a back alleyway. Ben is offered a test drive, but explains that he is not in the market for a motorcycle. The narrator notes that his fiancée, Samantha Pierce , despises motorcycles. Nevertheless, he inevitably takes up the offer and upon returning from his test drive, buys the motorcycle. Finishing a Tim Hortons coffee, he rolls up the cup's rim, as part of the fast-food chain's popular yearly promotional contest, to a message that reads ""Go West Young Man"". After celebrating his father's 60th birthday with his family, he breaks the news of his cancer to Samantha, as well as his desire to take a two-day vacation riding his newly purchased motorcycle. She implores Ben to reconsider a vacation, reasoning that the longer he waits to go into treatment, the worse his chances for survival are. Unwilling to ""become a patient"", possibly for the remainder of his expectedly short lifetime, he asks Samantha to come with him. Ben ultimately sets out from Toronto by himself. Reviewing the contents of his packed motorcycle, he takes out of a folder a children's book he had written about a mythical creature his father had told him stories of as a child called Grumps. His father had explained that children who manage to find the elusive Grumps are granted enormous capacities, which Ben later interprets as he grows up as meaning and purpose. Beginning his road trip, he does not, however, make it far before beginning to question the trip's worth in comparison to the potential value of immediately receiving treatment. He begins to make his way back to Toronto when he is encountered by two young men asking him for the closest Canadian Tire. The two friends explain to Ben that they are in the midst of a bet in which someone has challenged them to bicycle across Canada to Vancouver with no more than four hundred dollars for a case of beer. Inspired once more by a sense of adventure, Ben reconsiders his return home and again sets off westward. Early on in his road trip, Ben has a conversation with a man  staying in the same hotel who was also diagnosed with cancer earlier in his lifetime and overcame it. They begin talking about the man's wife and family when Ben asks how he knows he supposes one knows they are in love, alluding to his fiancée, to which the man replies that if one has to ask, they're not. Continuing on the road and without an itinerary, Ben makes stops at various landmarks, including giant novelty lawn chairs, paperclips and tee-pees, taking pictures along the way. Passing through Arborg, Manitoba, while stopped at an ice rink, Ben is caught off guard by the Stanley Cup sitting on a pedestal at centre ice with nobody around. Ben walks onto the rink and begins reading the inscriptions on the historic ice hockey trophy, when an Anaheim Ducks hockey player  skates onto the ice.  Having won the Stanley Cup with the Ducks the previous year, he is entitled to a day with the trophy. After being allowed to kiss the Stanley Cup, Ben watches as the Ducks player skates around with the trophy alone on the ice. Still in the Canadian Prairies, Ben's motorcycle breaks down on a road driving through Saskatchewan and, abandoning it, starts down the highway on foot. He cannot help but think that this would not have happened had he not visited the worlds largest prairie camel in Glenboro, Manitoba. He encounters a dead dog and, by way of the collar tag, contacts the unknowing owner, who picks Ben up, along with his motorcycle and the dog. The middle-aged, female owner takes him back to her ranch, where she inspects the motorcycle, revealing only minor problems. The two begin talking and she divulges to Ben that she is unmarried with a son who she rarely sees because he is working in Fort McMurray, AB and a four-year-old grand-daughter she has only seen once. After she takes Ben on a horseback ride to a beautiful panoramic view, she repairs his motorcycle and Ben continues on his way. The narrator reveals that after meeting Ben, inspired by their conversation, the lady travels to visit her son to Fort McMurray and despite missing him, she coincidentally meets the ""love of her life"" who asks her ""can you tell me where Dawson Street is?"" As his road trip extends well past his initially planned two-day vacation, Ben makes it to scenic Banff National Park in Alberta. Staying in the presidential suite of a local hotel, he goes through numerous voice messages on his cell phone from his fiancée and parents, begging him to come home. Ben calls Samantha who tells him that she will come to see him and will book a plane for the next morning. Later that day, Ben encounters a backpacker  exploring the backcountry with her dog and spends the night at her campsite. Conversing around a campfire, Ben reflects on his aspirations to be a writer and his failing to publish his first novel. They make love in her tent and Ben blissfully wakes up the next morning. Unbeknownst to Ben, Samantha had managed to catch a flight immediately and spent the night waiting in the hotel lobby. When Ben finally returns to the hotel, he tells her about the previous night. As the two begin walking away from the hotel, Samantha tells Ben that although she is upset and hurt, she would rather focus on the matter of Ben's cancer. She continues to question Ben's motives for leaving and, in the midst of the arguing, Ben reveals that he has not loved Samantha completely. Forbidding Ben to follow her, she takes off. Left behind in Banff, Ben pushes into British Columbia. Unable to sleep in his motel, he finds a pub. After some time, he stumbles out onto the street, vomiting. Regaining his composure, he is met by a panorama of the northern lights across the horizon and proceeds to call his mother. Ben makes his way down to Vancouver and takes a ferry to Vancouver Island where he drives to Tofino on the west coast of the island. Sitting in a diner, he struggles to find the appetite to eat his meal. In the meantime, a truck backs into Ben's motorcycle outside the diner, rendering it undriveable. From there, he heads for a beach frequented by surfers with his own rented surfboard and wetsuit. Looking out towards the Pacific Ocean, a couple approaches Ben and asks him to take their photo. They tell him that he lives in ""one of the most beautiful countries in the world."" Setting out on his surfboard, Ben does not, however, get up to ride a wave, but rather continues swimming further west, aimlessly. Finally, he stops and, sitting upright on his surfboard, witnesses a humpback whale breaking out of the water. Awe-struck, Ben remembers that his father would tell him as a child that it was not known what Grumps actually looked like, but that those who searched for Grumps knew who it was him when he was found. Concluding that he had, in fact, found Grumps, Ben returns home. Lying in bed with Samantha, they talk about his chances of overcoming his cancer and their inevitable breakup. He takes a cab to his parents' home. Exiting the taxi, he is met by his mother, father and sister waiting for him on the front steps, anticipating his return. The final scene reveals the movie's narrator  who is recording the final chapter for an audio book. The camera pans to the title of the book as ""One Week"" by Ben Tyler. The same book appears as a bestseller in a bookshop window, a silhouette of Ben and his motorcycle on its cover."

Kalpana’s destiny is followed from different perspective and a tale of human predicament is built around her. The films narrative unfolds with the anniversary function of 1999 Super Cyclone that devastated coastal Orissa. This was one of the severest cyclones of the last century. It had caused absolute havoc, leaving thousands dead and many more thousands homeless and destitute. The worst affected was the Bengali Hindu refugee settlement. Aids and relief came pouring in. So also came NGOs, media persons, politicians, and vested-interest groups. With so much external influence the local value system got affected, corruption and amoral practices became rampant.Dipankar, a TV Journalist from Bangladesh, is engaged in documenting the cyclone anniversary and the status of the post-cyclone survivors. With the help of an NGO group he covers the programme, and hears a great deal about Kalpana - the much publicised cyclone widow. Dipankar takes a keen interest on her and wants to do a special feature. The genesis of Kalpana’s ordeal is rooted in history. Like others in that locality her father a forced migrant from East Bengal during the partition, struggled all his life to establish his identity, even though he was a citizen of his adopted homeland. Kalpana born and brought up in coastal Orissa, India, was leading a harmonious life with her fisherman husband. As they were dreaming to add more colours into their life, the infamous super cyclone of October 1999 strikes. It leaves all her family member dead. Kalpana miraculously survives. And with the support of her childhood friend Akshaya she limps back to a life now full of emptiness. The links with her past being snapped off, Kalpana feels alienated in her own native place. A sense of dispossession engulfs her.Kalpana tired with her own struggle and very much bitter at the meaningless publicity made out of her, firmly refuses Dipankar for an interview. Disappointed, he returns to his own country without the story he wanted to do on Kalpana. Kalpana lives an isolated life with an uncertain future. She does small job with the support of local NGO and fights to safeguard her dignity from the lusts of society. Kalpana’s life is limited to ceaseless follow up with the Govt. officials for the death compensation package. Dipankara makes a repeat visit without his camera unit and he just wants to meet Kalpana. He is fascinated with her innocence, beauty and determination. He shares with her lot of things about himself, about his people and the life out there in Dhaka. He also learns about Kalpana and wants to put an end to her suffering.It becomes difficult on Kalpana’s part to reconcile in settling down with a person she hardly knows. Yet again, she is fed up with this place with bleak prospect. The frustration of the never ending follow-up for compensation money, the anguish of being treated as women of loose virtue by village youths, and the illicit advances by Rupa’s husband makes Kalpana insecured. Rupa, also believes how difficult it is for a single woman, especially a young and good looking widow to cope up with her present situation. She insists upon Kalpana to settle down with Dipankar in Bangladesh - the land of her forefathers. A brief stay in Kolkata prior to crossing the border becomes a revealing moment in Kalpana’s life. She realises she will be a misfit in the far off urban setting of Dhaka and would suffer further alienation. The memories of her homeland, of her childhood, of all that she had and all that she lost will haunt her for the rest of her life.

Weeks prior, Tsukasa announced to the world that he was engaged to Tsukushi. He released an embarrassing picture of her eating noodles, angering her. As a result of the announcement, Tsukushi's family become targets of media attention. Soon after, Tsukushi’s parents formally met with Kaede Dōmyōji , Tsukasa’s mother, to discuss the wedding. Kaede presented Tsukushi with a tiara which grants endless love to the owner and her partner. At the Hotel Volver, the couple are about to kiss when a man crashes through the window and seizes the tiara. Tsukasa pursues the thief with Tsukushi far behind, but the thief manages to escape. Tsukushi and Tsukasa return to their room, where they notice that the window has been fixed. The staff claim they heard no disturbance, even though Tsukasa and the thief have created chaos throughout the hotel.

They check into a motel before going to a casino, a location where Nishida told them the thief might be. They meet Shigeru Okawahara , who reveals that she is seeing Kazu Kaburagi , the heir of a large company that owns the hotel where the tiara was stolen. Tsukasa questions Kaburagi; he says that he was told to pretend nothing happened at the Hotel- in return for his cooperation, five million USD was deposited into his account. Kaburagi claims he does not know the thief. Back at the motel, Akira calls Tsukasa and informs him that the tiara will go on the black market in Hong Kong. Tsukushi and Tsukasa then plan to head there before Kaburagi arrives, saying that he heard about the auction. He gives them the five million to help them get the tiara back. Tsukushi and Tsukasa gamble the money at the roulette table in order to pay Kuburagi back. As the wheel is spinning, the two notice the thief and Tsukasa chases him by jumping over the table, causing the ball to land next to the winning space. The thief gets away and Tsukushi is thrown out of the casino for refusing to hand over the money. Outside, she reunites with Tsukasa and the rest of F4, who Tsukasa has called.

A dead man lies next to him. As he stumbles around in the limited light, cold, and darkness, he comes upon a dilapidated area with damaged pieces of technology all around him. While he is trying to get a damaged panel to work, suddenly, digital phantoms appear and inform him of a paradise known as Eden Log. They play a generic welcome message for the workers, where Tolbiac learns that workers are volunteers making sacrifices with the hope of gaining citizenship, presumably for the society above ground, and that Eden Log can offer a passport. Tolbiac passes through the main entryway, but remembers nothing, even after examining several crude maps and some damaged equipment. A second message plays, reasserting the fairness of the worker's contract, though the details lack context. The workers will enter the ""cycle,"" and by working below can contribute to the world above through a fair exchange. Their job is described as ""looking after the plant,"" and they are promised that if they do so, the plant will ""look after them."" The worker's message reiterates that the worker's only reward is found in their drive to become part of the new society. With no memory of recent events, or even his own name, Tolbiac begins scrounging for supplies and looking for a way out. After recovering some clothes and a harness with mounted lights, he sets out for an exit. After some wandering, he comes upon a bearded man who seems pinned against a wall by the same plant-like vines that protrude from the technology and along the tunnels. The man, clearly in great pain and mentally addled from the experience, only identifies himself as the ""architect"" and reveals that the plant-like vines have invaded his body and are slowly taking over. As Tolbiac approaches, the man warns him away to keep him from danger but also because something about Tolbiac makes the vines more aggressive. Just as Tolbiac is about to leave completely, he hears a loud, growling noise that seems to be approaching. The architect warns Tolbiac that the noise is ""your end"" and that he should kill himself immediately. When Tolbiac refuses, the architect warns him to run, but Tolbiac cannot as the noise has grown so loud that he loses consciousness. When Tolbiac wakes up, he is in a new, yet still unfamiliar area with no sign of the Architect. As he crawls through a passage to find an exit, he quickly finds himself enclosed in a cube on a conveyor. The machinery stops suddenly, colliding Tolbiac's cube with the one ahead of him, and through the translucent glass, he sees a dead body in the next cube. Panicked, Tolbiac frees himself by swinging the cube off the hinge and crashing to the floor beneath, though this knocks him unconscious again. This time, he finds himself on a slightly better-lit area with his first major landmark indicating that he is on Level -4. While exploring, he finds a dead technician with his hand in a palm-recognition device. After tinkering with the technology, Tolbiac activates the last recording. In it, the dead scientist apparently had an argument with the Eden Log personnel above where he refused to open up access to the ""rezo"" to security. It becomes clear that the levels of the plantation are sharply divided and massive. What becomes clear is that due to deteriorating and increasingly dangerous conditions in the plant, a large worker's revolt was in progress, and the dead technician was instrumental in cutting off security  from the lower ones. The revolting workers demanded to know the condition of the former workers allowed to join the society on the surface, which the company refused. Prior to the security forces breaking into the lab, the technician reveals that there is a record of this information, and unless Eden Log complies, they will release it to the society above. The recording ends with the security forces breaking in and requesting additional orders on containing the situation from their superiors. Their orders were to find the architect, secure the remaining technician on Level -3 to prevent any further broadcasts, and recover the data from the labs. Tolbiac checks the dead technician's palm activation device, but the system does not recognize him. Nevertheless, he pulls the data chip out of the device and proceeds to try finding an exit. After some maneuvering in the tunnels, Tolbiac comes up to Level -3. While avoiding the security forces, he overhears their discussion as they search for the remaining technician and the architect. The security forces have also chained up what looks like a mutated human, and they hint that a significant amount of the worker population have also changed into mutants. During a brief scuffle with the security forces, Tolbiac makes a break for the tunnels and fights off their chained mutant, climbing up a narrow passage to Level -2. On Level -2, Tolbiac hears a strange, ambient music playing in a chamber surrounding a well-lit, but small, laboratory. Suddenly ambushed on all sides by the mutants in the dark, he is rescued by a figure in a protective suit  who uses a bright light and loud noise to fend off the mutants. Unfortunately, the light and noise are equally painful to Tolbiac. Capturing him, she uses a gas to knock him out. When he wakes up, she reveals that she is the only remaining Botanist on Level -2, who has survived by remaining isolated and careful. She initially believes Tolbiac to be infected, and progressing in mutation, because he refuses to speak. Once he does, she explains that the ""rezo"" is the term used in the plant to describe the area in which the workers operate as well as the workers themselves. Eden Log has been using a central living plant, to harvest power. The workers are part of this because the plant's sap has energetic properties, giving the workers unusual stamina and strength. However, the more sap that they've taken from the plant, the more toxic and hostile it became. The mutants are the workers who had been corrupted by this sap, and the botanist is both confused and amazed that Tolbiac, an apparent worker, has somehow managed to escape its effects. Seeing his confusion, she conducts a brief test to learn more about him. She connects him to the plant with a simple exam in mind, if he is healthy, the plant will try to infect him , and they'll both know that he is infection-free. Better still, the botanist hopes to find out what the plant wants from the humans. During the transfusion, something goes wrong, and Tolbiac seems to be able to force something back into the plant, causing the seemingly sterile plant to sprout and become lush with growth and fruit. Surprised and scared, the Botanist disconnects him from the plant. Shortly after, the mutants begin an assault against the botanist's lab, and Tolbiac is tricked and abandoned as bait. When one of the mutants manages to get inside, Tolbiac manages to tie it up and escape. Outside, he catches up with the botanist and fights off several mutants attacking her with increased primal rage. Having established dominance, the remaining mutants back away long enough for the two to run to a working elevator. Inside, Tolbiac is overcome by primal urges for the first time, having flashbacks of his blackout with the Architect and realizes that he had killed him. In this state, he feels part of his humanity slip away in a roar, only to calm down. He then begins to act on the lust he feels for the botanist, first acting tenderly, then brutally as he makes sexual advances on her. When they finish, Tolbiac realizes that his mental flashes during sex that depicted him brutally raping the botanist were not just in his head. While they had started with attraction, in his fugue state he raped her. Under control of himself again, Tolbiac weakly tries to tell her that he was not himself, and she reluctantly goes with him when the elevator breaks down. Together, the two traverse several tunnels, though they remain wary of one another. Eventually, they stumble upon the location of the hidden technician on Level -2, who managed to halt his mutation at the cost of his life. Like the Architect, he underwent a critical merging with the plant in order to keep himself alive. He reveals with more detail what the botanist suspected. In addition, he confirms the ugly truth: the plant workers are never sent to the surface, they are simply exploited by Eden Log. More creatures attack, but Tolbiac manages to fight them off and protect the botanist. The two then approach the exit level, Level -1, which is where the sap is collected. Here, Tolbiac realizes fully that the term ""plant"" is a double meaning as the whole facility is, in fact, a power plant which uses a biological plant as its power supply. The two proceed upward quickly through the sap collector, since the tree , are above it. Tolbiac and the Botanist suddenly find themselves in the middle of a skirmish between mutants, who are following them from below, and the security forces who are descending. The Botanist spots the cubes which convey humans up to the tree and, without explanation, runs away from Tolbiac towards the underground levels. When he catches up to her, she states her recent revelation to the disoriented Tolbiac; the technicians discovered that the workers, who became ill and infected from using the sap in the rezo, were sent to the surface in cubes to be ""cured"" by the tree, but this was a lie because the energy in the sap was actually being taken from the humans in the cubes. Immediately after, she begins convulsing and hearing a noise that Tolbiac does not, and he realizes that he has been infected all along . When he raped her, he passed the contamination onto her. He apologizes, but she is too heartbroken to have come so close and survived so long to be infected now. She savagely attacks Tolbiac, but runs away before he is similarly overcome with the infection's rage. Before she breaks for the tunnels, she tosses him a final data chip with recordings from before the rebellion. Proceeding upward, Tolbiac emerges in a chamber that for the first time, he recognizes. Dodging another scuffle of security forces and mutants, he sneaks into the surveillance room and begins watching the compiled data clips and piecing all the information together. For the first time, he sees all the messages on full screens and can make out all the details. While watching all the clips, Tolbiac slowly realizes what his true identity is. He was the former captain of the guard, trusted with the full secrets of Eden Log, and asked to quell the rebellion and keep the information from getting out. With another guard, the two descended to the lowest levels where Tolbiac became contaminated and, in a rage, had killed his companion. Instead of mutating, he awoke with no memory, which is where his journey began. When he realizes this, the computer simultaneously confirms his identity as Captain Tolbiac and his completely successful mission of having killed the architect, recovered all the lost data of the technicians, and having put down the mutants, which the guards have just accomplished working under the orders he issued before going underground. As the guards burst into the surveillance office, they immediately stop and recognize him as Captain Tolbiac. On the surface, Tolbiac is saluted by Eden Log for a successful mission and for protecting the company's secrets as he stands in front of an animated board depicting the full process of the power harvesting procedure. Workers are sent to the lowest levels, given sap to energize them, then work until they are depleted or dead as their energy is harvested to power the city above. Once they succumb, their bodies are placed in the cubes and used to feed the tree, providing the sap for future workers. Realizing the destruction of the tree's life cycle, and now comprehending what the plant was communicating, Tolbiac knows that the Eden Log tree's cycle needs to return to a natural process rather than feeding off of humans, though human beings will no longer be able to use the tree's life cycle to power their cities. Using his authority, he walks into the tree's main chamber and plugs himself in. Like before in the botanists lab, he causes the tree to demonstrate explosive growth, which destroys the power plant and causes a full blackout. The tree's growth overruns the city where it covers everything in a lush green coating. In the final scene, the perspective focuses directly on Tolbiac's face as a single tear falls from his eye."

The Cook family is visited by their distant cousin, psychologist Mariah Johnston . A contemporary of Justin and Kerry's parents, Mariah is about to receive an award for her years of community work, particularly in the area of civil rights. Having been born after the Civil Rights Movement, Justin and Kerry never experienced Jim Crow segregation, and the two fail to appreciate the stories about the era that Mariah and their parents recount at dinner. While Justin and Kerry sleep that night, they are mysteriously transported to a small town in Georgia in the early 1960s. While there, the siblings participate in a sit-in at a segregated lunch counter. The protest is staged by a group of local teenagers and young adults—including their cousin Mariah. The siblings are horrified by the hostility and racism of local White residents, and inspired by the strength displayed by Mariah and the others as the group is harassed during the sit-in. When they awaken the following morning, the siblings find themselves back in the 1980s. No one is aware of their journey to the past except Justin and Kerry themselves . As the Cook family watches Mariah accept her award later that day, Justin and Kerry do so with a greater appreciation for Mariah, the Civil Rights Movement, and the history of African Americans in general.

A fact he keeps secret from his father, a washed-up wrestler under the name of Tonina Jackson. Tonino has had some recent popularity in the ring, only due to Fernando bribing other wrestlers to lose. Fernando is also secretly moonlighting as the masked luchador Huracán Ramírez to further help with the household expenses. He is assisted by his somewhat dim-witted friend, Pichí, who doubles as his trainer and his stand-in for any situation in which Fernando and Huracán might have to be seen at the same time. Tonino has a growing resentment against Huracán's popularity and is further aggravated when he refuses to face him in the ring. After a night of partying, Fernando's father discovers his secret job as a lounge singer. Unimpressed with his new career path and disappointed he ended his schooling, he demands Fernando to leave his household. Tonina is later dissuaded by his younger daughter, who explains Fernando has been helping with finances for some time and without his spare income, the family would have been unable to survive. Meanwhile, the local wrestling promoter discovers Fernando has been setting up his father's matches. The promoter promises not to expose him as long as further bribes do not occur. In a following match against the wrestler Bello Califa, a drunken Pichí is mistaken for Huracán Ramírez. Pichí manages to defeat the flamboyant Bello Califa and after much confusion, both Fernando's sisters discover the true identity of Huracán. In the next day's match, Fernando wrestles against El Médico Asesino, only to be interrupted by an angry Totina. Despite being unwilling to fight against his father, Fernando relents. After their impromptu match comes to an end, Totina develops a great respect for Huracán Ramírez and decides to form an alliance with him. Meanwhile, Gloria, a fellow lounge singer and Fernando's former flame, feels dejected when her love for Fernando goes on unrequited. She is later enraged to learn that he has a new girlfriend, Laura, Pichí's older sister. A broken-hearted Gloria seeks revenge against her former lover, and after discovering his secret identity of Huracán Ramírez, plots to kill him by enlisting the aid of rival luchadors Frank ""El Carnicero"" Bucher, El Médico Asesino, Camilo ""Bulldog"" Pérez. The plan is to kidnap Fernando's father, who will thereby be unable to attend the night's tag-team match, and be replaced with Bulldog. During the course of the match, Bulldog will turn against Huracán, and the three luchadors will beat him to death. Their plan is foiled however, as Pichí quickly alerts Fernando who arrives just in time as Huracán to free his father, but his leg is badly injured in the process. Totina leaves for the match, only for Huracán to be replaced last minute by Bulldog, a reversal of Gloria's original plan. Fernando manages to rush to the wrestling stadium in time to fend off his father's attackers, but in his wounded state is easily overpowered by them. In an illegal move, one of the luchadors unmasks Fernando, revealing his true identity to his father. At this, both father and son are put in a blind rage, in which they both are able to defeat their attackers at the thunderous applause of fans."

Michael is curious to learn what happened to Anne, which leads Walter to reminisce of the summer of 1939, at the Keyes estate in Norfolk. On the day of Alexander's birthday, Anne has prepared a table in the garden to celebrate. Anne's friend, the outspoken MP Hector  and lover, the reserved Lawrence  are present for the festivities. When Alexander arrives that night, he also brings a guest, the quiet government employee, Joseph Balcombe, . During dinner, Hector rants about Britain's lack of action against Nazi Germany, noting that while his view is unpopular, he feels that it needs to be said. It is later revealed that he has been one of those calling out for a new prime minister. The next day, while looking for a missing cat, Anne finds her in one of the property's sheds, which had been off-limits due to them containing Alexander's manuscript papers. She finds gramophone records labelled ""Foxtrot,"" which upon listening, actually contain recorded meetings and telephone conversations. Alexander reveals that he has allowed Balcombe to store government documents in the shed. Two weeks later, Anne is notified that Hector has been found dead, of an apparent suicide. Anne wonders if Balcombe had anything to do with Hector's death. Alexander brushes off the idea, but does offer to ask Balcombe to remove the records from the shed, something he promises to do the next day during a picnic. While there, the picnic-goers take off for a walk, including Aunt Elizabeth , leaving Anne to watch over baby Oliver. Anne awakens to find Oliver and his pushchair missing. She follows his cries to no avail, and when the family returns, they search, too, until they find him in his pushchair on a lane. Anne vehemently denies moving the baby, but the incident plants roots of doubt about Anne's word. Balcombe removes the records that night, but Anne has secretly kept two of them. The family then returns to London because Parliament has been recalled. While there, Anne listens to the records. One contains a recording of a distressed Hector pleading with Balcombe to cease calling him and also his parents. However, the maid bursts into the room, which causes the gramophone to fall, and the record to break into pieces. On September 1, Anne gives a second record to her fellow actor and friend, Gilbert , who is subsequently found dead from an apparent suicide. Anne travels back to Norfolk to keep Aunt Elizabeth company, where she listens to the second recording. On it, she recognizes Balcombe's voice, along with another, her brother, Ralph. Ralph is heard suggesting the name ""thin man dancing"" for a covert operation. The name he suggested is a reference to a childhood toy with which the siblings played. This confirmed to Anne that Ralph is not to be trusted. At a party in London, Anne attempts to tell Lawrence of Ralph's involvement, but he already knows. Lawrence convinces Anne to bring him the recording at a rendezvous at a suburban veterinary surgery. After Anne finds Lawrence's body in a shed filled with euthanised pets, she is drugged by her father and taken prisoner in Aunt Elizabeth's house which is close to St Paul's Cathedral. Balcombe pays her a visit, and brings with him the second recording, which was intercepted by him. He informs her that the recording had been made for her father, and that was why they were stored at the house in Norfolk. He also informs her that their house in London is being used for series of pro-appeasement meetings which her father is chairing. Alexander later admits to her that he believes that Britain will be completely destroyed unless it secures a peace treaty with Germany, and that nothing should disturb that. Alexander tells her that she is the only member of the family that does not share his beliefs, which is why they are keeping her locked away and sedated. After some time, Maud unlocks the door to release her while the rest of the family is at the park. She goes past them, and when they act as though nothing wrong had happened, Anne runs away. Back in the present, Walter tells Michael that Anne died in Canada 20 years ago, and that he was just doing what his family and Balcombe had wanted. It is then revealed that Balcombe convinced Walter to move Oliver's pushchair into the lane. Michael asks Oliver and Walter to accompany him to meet his mother. They travel to the same park where Anne had last seen her family. A woman, Michael's mother, wheels an elderly woman towards them. That elderly woman is revealed to be Anne, and Michael tells them that that he knew the truth all along but wanted to hear it from them."

While there, the picnic-goers take off for a walk, including Aunt Elizabeth , leaving Anne to watch over baby Oliver. Anne awakens to find Oliver and his pushchair missing. She follows his cries to no avail, and when the family returns, they search, too, until they find him in his pushchair on a lane. Anne vehemently denies moving the baby, but the incident plants roots of doubt about Anne's word. Balcombe removes the records that night, but Anne has secretly kept two of them. The family then returns to London because Parliament has been recalled. While there, Anne listens to the records. One contains a recording of a distressed Hector pleading with Balcombe to cease calling him and also his parents. However, the maid bursts into the room, which causes the gramophone to fall, and the record to break into pieces. On September 1, Anne gives a second record to her fellow actor and friend, Gilbert , who is subsequently found dead from an apparent suicide. Anne travels back to Norfolk to keep Aunt Elizabeth company, where she listens to the second recording. On it, she recognizes Balcombe's voice, along with another, her brother, Ralph. Ralph is heard suggesting the name ""thin man dancing"" for a covert operation. The name he suggested is a reference to a childhood toy with which the siblings played. This confirmed to Anne that Ralph is not to be trusted. At a party in London, Anne attempts to tell Lawrence of Ralph's involvement, but he already knows. Lawrence convinces Anne to bring him the recording at a rendezvous at a suburban veterinary surgery. After Anne finds Lawrence's body in a shed filled with euthanised pets, she is drugged by her father and taken prisoner in Aunt Elizabeth's house which is close to St Paul's Cathedral. Balcombe pays her a visit, and brings with him the second recording, which was intercepted by him. He informs her that the recording had been made for her father, and that was why they were stored at the house in Norfolk. He also informs her that their house in London is being used for series of pro-appeasement meetings which her father is chairing.

This scene leads into the flashback. An unnamed man  is shown strategically placing a travel bag within a train in the Chennai Central railway station and in a shopping mall. He proceeds to place another bag, under the false pretense of lodging an FIR, in the toilet of a police station located in Anna Salai, Chennai. He then arrives on the rooftop of a building under construction and sets up his base of operations, equipped with various modern technology gadgets and instruments. He calls up Maraar and informs him that 5 bombs have been placed in different locations throughout Chennai, which are programmed to explode simultaneously within four hours. The common man demands that he would like to negotiate with a senior Government official. Maraar seeks the services of the Chief Secretary([[Lakshmi  to act as the negotiator. Maraar also alerts his team involved in intelligence research and surveillance, tapping all the available resources in gathering preliminary information and tracing the location of the caller. Meanwhile, the caller tips off television news reporter Natasha Rajkumar , telling her to reach Anna Salai police station immediately as it is going to be ""the most important day of her life"". Maraar initially suspects the anonymous caller to be bluffing, but his doubts are dispelled as the caller, to prove his seriousness and the police force's helplessness, reveals that a bomb has been planted in the Anna Salai police station. When the bomb disposal squad find the bomb, there is only 3 minutes left. The common man calls Maraar and tells him the instructions to deactivate the bomb. Based on these, the bomb is defused. Natasha reaches the scene on the caller's instructions and reports about the situation. There is intense debate between Maraar and the Chief Secretary on who would act as the negotiator with the common man. The chief minister does not want to get into this and the Chief Secretary also does not want to take upon the responsibility. Hence, Maraar himself takes on the role of the negotiator with the common man. The common man demands the release of four terrorists, Abdullah, Inayadullah, Ahamadullah and Karamchand Lala, who have been involved in and arrested for many of the major terrorist attacks and activities that have happened in the country during the previous decade. Maraar cleverly uses Natasha to fake a report on live television that four terrorists are being relocated to an undisclosed common site, turning the caller's tool back onto him. Maraar's men find out that the caller is using advanced software to automatically switch the numbers and locations of his mobile phone SIM card every minute, rendering their manpower and the obsolete equipments useless and prompting them to employ the services of a young hacker, who turns out to be an IIT dropout. In the meantime, Maraar is also able to obtain a facial composite of the caller with help of the police officer to whom the caller had approached to lodge the fake FIR during the earlier scenes of the film; but much of the time passes without any concrete results on the identity or the location of the caller. Ultimately, Maraar agrees with the caller's demand and puts two of his best men, Arif Khan  and Sethuraman , in charge of handing over the four terrorists at the Sozhavaram airstrip. Once there, the caller confirms the identity of all the four men via a conference call with Arif and Maraar, and then asks Arif and Sethu to unlock their handcuffs and leave them alone at a particular spot. Sethu orders his men to do as told but at the last moment, Arif decides not to hand over Abdullah to ensure all the information regarding the locations of the bombs can be forced out from the caller. Sethu argues with Arif and demands he do as ordered but Arif forcefully grabs the terrorist and starts walking away. As they leave behind the remaining three, the caller, unaware of the ongoing fiasco, uses a cell phone placed in a rigged jeep at the spot to detonate an explosion in which all the three terrorists perish. Arif relays this information to Maraar, which is confirmed by the anonymous caller as he reveals that he is just a ""stupid common man"", not belonging to any terrorist outfit, and his plan was not to free the terrorists but to kill them, avenging all the terrorist attacks they had helped carry out in Coimbatore and other major cities of India, thus ""cleaning the roach-infested house"". Maraar tries to reason with him and tries to find out his religion, the justification for this action, any personal incidents that prompted him to take such an action etc. The common man narrates an incident of how a Muslim woman was being tortured and molested by communal people. The common man also says that he can take actions for the sufferings meted out to people from other communities too. The caller threatens to blow up the remaining bombs across the city unless Arif and Sethu kill Abdullah. The Chief Secretary ([[Lakshmi  tells Maraar that the Chief Minister has to know about the Current Situation but Maraar disagrees and tells her that he'll face the consequences, and orders Arif to kill the terrorist. As Natasha reports the scene on television, the young hacker traces the caller's location but refuses to reveal it saying that the caller was actually ""brainy"", and compared to him, the hacker was only one among the billions. But Maraar looks in the hacker's computer, discovers the location and leaves abruptly towards the site. The caller calls up Maraar, as he is on the way, for a final time to further reveal that he had not planted any other bomb in the city. At this point, Maraar surprisingly declares he already knew there were no more bombs which makes it clear that his decision to kill the last terrorist wasn't taken in fear but in confidence. Maraar reaches the caller's location just as the latter is leaving the place, having destroyed all his gadgets and equipments, leaving behind no evidence. The two meet briefly when Maraar, identifying the anonymous caller on the basis of the face sketch, offers the man a ride home and introduces himself. Both shake hands, when Maraar's voice-over cuts back as he says the man told him his real name but his name doesn't have any significance. The film ends on an idealistic note, with Maraar admitting that they all knew the common man was disturbed because of the insecure environment and the incompetence of the governing authorities but he never imagined him to go to such lengths and have the guts to do something like that. He also repeats that the facts of this incident cannot be found in any written record but only in the memories of those who actually witnessed it, and acknowledges that although the incidence has ambiguous moral significance, he personally feels that whatever happened, happened for the best."

Nawaz Ali hails from Lahore in Pakistan and Ranvir Singh Grewal belongs to a village, Jakopur, in Punjab, India. About 20 years ago, both of them migrated to Sydney, Australia, in search of work, where they met and became the best of friends. Gradually, their hard work paid off. Ranvir opened an Indian restaurant, which became a runaway success. Nawaz Ali opened a shop opposite Ranvir’s restaurant. It did well and he could manage to lead a comfortable life but he was not as successful as Ranvir. Nawaz Ali was very grounded in his culture and values and this helped him to remain level-headed and not get carried away by the comforts of life in Australia. He never lost sight of what was morally and ethically right and stood by his Asian values. On the other hand, Ranvir got carried away by his success. He felt that he was superior to the other Indians and Asians who were not as successful. He found merit in all things associated with the white folks – their lifestyle, their values and culture, their behaviour and mannerisms – and looked down upon his Indian upbringing and values. He had no more use for ethics and morality. He became very conscious of his money, status and reputation. The difference in outlook and behaviour drive the two friends apart until they reach a point where Ranvir stops talking to Nawaz. However, Nawaz still cares for his friend and tries to keep their friendship alive. As the film opens, Ranvir and Nawaz are well settled in Australia with their respective families. Nawaz has one son, Amaan Ali and Ranvir has a son, Yuvraj, and a daughter, Meet. Amaan and Yuvraj are roughly the same age and best buddies since childhood, despite the rift between their fathers. However, the difference in the thinkings of the two fathers is reflected in the personalities of their sons. Amaan is a sensible, level-headed young man. He is strongly grounded in and comfortable with his Asian identity. However, he is contemporary in his outlook. He does a fine balance of sticking to his values even as he adapts to the society around him and its mores and traditions. Yuvraj is the exact opposite of Amaan. Due to Ranvir’s indulgent attitude, Yuvraj grows up to be a rich, spoilt brat. He also feels closer to the white folks than to the Asians around him. He has no idea of Indian culture or values, no ethics and no morals. He loves women, booze, drugs... Yuvraj’s sister, Meet, is quite like him in her values, upbringing and behaviour. She is going steady with a white young man but is not sure how her father will react to this development. However, she also has a special relationship with Amaan. Nothing is said but she instictively feels that she can always depend on his help, that he will always be there for her. Amaan too feels an instinctive pull towards her but waits for the right time to tell her of his love for her. Ranvir feels that the people in his village look down upon him because they feel that he is not a good son, since his father, Sardar Joginder Singh, lives here all alone. Sardarji wants to stay in Punjab, till his last breath. Ranvir cons Sardarji into going with him. In Australia, however, things are very different. The cost of living is high and labour is expensive. Ranvir enlists Sardarji’s help for his restaurant. Gradually, Sardarji’s status becomes no more than that of a paid servant. One night, at a party, Yuvraj meets Mahi. Mahi has come from Punjab to Sydney for her studies. She is a modern day young Indian woman, contemporary but with a solid foundation in Indian values and culture. She is beautiful, sexy, intelligent and confident. As they fall in love, she tries to reform him and for some time, it seems as though he will sort his life out. But old habits die hard. Yuvraj gradually falls back into his old ways and Mahi is unable to stop him. Will Ranvir ever see Nawaz’s point of view and will they ever be friends again? Will Sardarji remain a prisoner to his son’s whims or will he rebel against him and return to Punjab? Will Yuvraj ever understand ethics and morality? Will Mahi return to Yuvraj? Will Ranvir accept a white boyfriend for Meet? And Amaan, who loves Meet – will he ever tell her about his love? As Virsa answers these and other questions, it makes a strong statement about remaining true to one’s values, culture and upbringing even as we constantly adapt and adjust to the society around us. It explores ways of addressing the identity conflicts of immigrant Asians in Western societies so that the succeeding generations can benefit from the best facets of both the cultures.

Kojūrō is a kindly master, but his character totally changes when he consumes alcohol. On the road, they encounter many different people: a traveling singer with her child, a father taking his daughter Otane to be sold into prostitution, a pilgrim, a policeman searching for a notorious thief, and Tōzaburō, the suspicious man the officer has his eyes on. Genpachi, the spear carrier, is also followed by an orphaned boy named Jirō who wants to be a samurai. When Kojūrō and Genpachi inadvertently capture the thief—who was the pilgrim in disguise—Kojūrō is disgusted when the authorities praise him and not his servant, even though Genpachi probably contributed more. He is also upset that he does not have the money to save Otane from being sold. In the end it is Tōzaburō who saves Otane, using the money he saved to rescue his own daughter, but decided to use for Otane after finding out his daughter had died. Depressed, Kojūrō takes Genta out drinking, despite the protests of the latter. When a band of boisterous samurai complain of Kojūrō drinking with someone of lower birth, Kojūrō gets upset. The samurai pull their swords and kill both the servant and his master. Genpachi arrives too late, but in a fury kills all the samurai with the spear. Authorities do not charge him with a crime, so he heads home carrying the ashes of Kojūrō and Genta. When Jirō tries to follow him, he shoos him off, telling him never to become a samurai.

As they spend the night drinking and hanging out, a light appears overhead. Jean is the first to notice something wrong when she videotapes a UFO overhead. At first her friends do not believe her and are not convinced about the tape. That night while they are sitting around the campfire the aliens attack. Four flee for their lives, Jean still clutching the camera, but cannot escape and they are suddenly abducted by a UFO. They wake up in a cell on the ship. Jean uses the camera's night vision to explore the alien glyphs and passages. They eventually rounded up and pushed into a room where they are tied down and vivisected. Jean awakens in a hospital, suffering from terrible flashbacks. That night a shadowy figure sneaks into her room and staples something into the back of her neck, causing the flashbacks to stop and leaving Jean with no memory of the abduction. Jean is questioned by a staff psychiatrist, Dr. Booker, who reveals that she is in a special facility for UFO abductees. She has to remain there until they are certain that she can resume a normal life. The military attache, Commander Shakti, wants her lobotomized. Jean breaks into another wing of the hospital to find her friends and discovers that part of the hospital is reserved for mutants, the insane and the lobotomized. She sees a woman having her skull drilled. Jean is then captured by Shakti and given electric shock therapy until she is unconscious. When she wakes up, Shakti interrogates her and then sends her to an execution room. Jean lobotomizes the nurse instead and disguises the nurse as herself, by covering her with gore. She wanders around the basement, looking for a way out through the vents, until she finds an empty storage room. She explores the area, eventually finding her things in a box labelled with her name. She also finds her video camera with the tape missing, but still with its memory stick. She replays the video and is shocked to see the entire abduction on tape. She escapes the storage room, killing a guard on the way. She also sees and tapes a scientist tending alien larvae in a lab and a scientist masturbating the aliens' genitals to extract sperm. Jean breaks into a worker's locker room and disguises herself. There she runs into her doctor Thomas. She finds out the aliens have escaped and are infecting the facility. When the infected are killed alien larva cracks out of their skulls and escape. Jean and Thomas try to save her friends but they are a mess and Todd barely remembers Jean. Jean just gets them to safety when Todd turns on them. Thomas shows Jean the way out and reveals that the hospital is actually part of the alien ship. Todd kills Britney and Thomas and an alien larva bursts out of Thomas' head just as he dies. Jean is captured by an adult alien, but she shoots it in the throat. Later, Jean finds herself in another lab, looking at a series of human clones of her and her friends. Shakti explains that Jean died in the abduction and she was a clone. Jean, furiously kills her clone by pulling out its umbilical cord. Dr. Brooks fakes removing jean's memory suppression chip, used to keep her memory erased before returning her home.

Now he runs a small boutique hotel with his girlfriend, Miranda . Every evening he plays the piano at a local restaurant to inattentive customers; all this has left him highly unsatisfied, and he has always wanted to do something big in life. So one day he decides to host a gala concert dedicated to a native son and noted composer, Valentin Lucinsky, whose widow Veronica  still resides in a grand villa in the village. At first Larry manages to convince Veronica to allow the concert to be held at the local amphitheatre, where famous pianist Narcisco Ortega  would play her late great spouse's music, 'chosen by her'. Though soon things start to go awry, as his long lost daughter Frankie  arrives out of the blue, looking for him, another social-climber, Sebastian Burrows , latches on to the project convincing Veronica to give it to him and Larry's girlfriend grows suspicious of his relationship with the composer's former muse, Helena , who leads a secluded life on the island. As the movie progresses several sub plots reveal a variety of estrangements between various key characters, and gradually they are healed amidst the rising melodrama surrounding the concert.Four Last Songs Film.comFour Last Songs - Details Yahoo!

21464156	/m/05f9m2n	Pitões, aldeia do Barroso				{}	{}	"{""/m/0jtdp"": ""Documentary""}"	 Sheltered from the cold winds which blow across the mountains, on a green valley of the Barroso chain, in Trás-os-Montes, Pitões da Júnias is one of the last Portuguese villages keeping in activity a system of mutual help, of communal management and exploration of collective patrimony: the village council, the bread oven, the shepherd, the cattle fields, the “ox of the people”. In this old community, built on granite rocks, live people who have ever lived there and others: old emigrants from everywhere in the world, who built their lives abroad but decided to spend their last days in the place where they were born. Here they left friends, children and grand-children, with whom they enjoy spending their time telling stories and talking about life. Besides, there are literate children in the village now, playing the game, sliding timidly into the story. To survive is to know how to face violence, how to live with it: how to kill and flay a lamb, for instance, or how to live with another kind of violence, more eloquent: a giant’s fight, the kind of fight we see between the village bulls. It is impressing. It explains the open smile of the ambassador of the US, who came here as a simple visitor. From one situation to another, from shot to shot, a portrait of everyday life is drawn, of unique and secular moments, still older than the faces of the men who live in this place: vulnerable, threatened in their wealth, vanishing in the mirror. Living people, they live in a fainting world, where time flows softly away, like the slow waters of the river. Just their portrait will be left. .

Unbeknownst to her, the boss has speculated in the commodity market, and lost not only his money and that of his wealthy wife, but also some of the firm's funds too. His wife would like to quietly divorce him to marry her politician friend, but the husband asks her for money to avoid a scandal. When Mary changes her mind and asks for the restitution of her savings, her boss refuses and mistreats her. That causes a confrontation between Jimmy and Mary's boss, and they fight. Meanwhile, also the politician and an honest accountant of the firm, who discovered his superior's misdeeds but kept silent fearing to lose his job, decide to confront Mary's boss. During the fight, he takes a gun from a drawer, and menaces them all. He trips and falls through a window to his death. The witnesses decide to declare it was a suicide and go on with their lives.

Evangeline Broussard prepares to hang herself from her balcony when she is stopped by a man trying to reassure her that he is truly Louis and that she shouldn't hang herself. Evangeline calls him a liar, then jumps, hanging herself and also causing her head to rip off and bounce down the stairs. Louis stares over the balcony as his eyes switch to a demonic shade of orange. Modern day, Maddi  is preparing to go to a party held by Angela . Along with her friends, Lily  and Suzanne , Maddie arrives at the party. She realizes her ex-boyfriend, Colin  is there, dealing drugs as he has been threatened by his drug lord to sell enough drugs at Angela's party to pay double what he normally gets or die. Also there is Lily's ex-boyfriend Dex  and his friend Jason . As the party progresses, Angela prompts everyone to go wild, as she must make money off the party or she will have to live on the streets. Lily and Dex eventually reunite in an upstairs bedroom, while Suzanne becomes incredibly drunk. While Maddie is hanging out with Jason, she goes to the toilet only to have a hand grab her through the mirror. As she attempts to show Suzanne, they pass it off as an elaborate trick placed by Angela. Soon after, the police break up the party, stating Angela neglected to get a party permit and that it doesn't qualify as a private party since she was charging admission. Panicked, Colin stuffs his drugs into a grate to hide it from the police, before leaving. Maddie, Lily, Dex and Jason leave with the rest of the partiers, leaving an upset Angela alone in the house. After a while, the group return, unable to find Suzanne, who reveals herself to have passed out. Colin also returns for his drugs and, with Angela, goes into the basement to find them. When the pair instead find a hidden door, Angela remarks that the house is full of hidden rooms, including a tunnel that leads to the next estate over. They enter the room and find six skeletons. Joined by the rest of the group, Angela assumes that the skeletons are the remains of the missing party guests of Evangeline Broussard. Angela discovers a gold tooth in one of the skeletons, but when she tries to take it the skeleton bites her hand. As they all head upstairs, Angela starts to feel woozy, and Colin attempts to leave the house, only to discover that the gate is locked and can't be opened even with the keys to the house. While everyone plans to wait the night out, Suzanne details how Evangeline supposedly practiced black magic in the hopes that she would attract the attentions of Louis, only to have that magic go wrong during a séance. The only person found alive was the maid, who was found in her room scribbling spells on her walls, having been driven insane by the previous night's events. Angela slowly succumbs to the skeleton bite, and enters a bathroom where she turns into a demon. She returns to the group, who partake in a game of spin the bottle. Eventually, Angela infects Dex by kissing him. Lily angrily leads Dex into a nearby room, where the pair have sex. Dex and Lily begin to have doggy style sex, when suddenly Dex transforms into a demon. He pulls his penis out of Lily's vagina and presses it against her anus. She doesn't seem to mind and doesn't turn to see his transformation. With a grunt Dex suddenly shoves his penis fully into Lily's anus, causing her to cry out and then suddenly become a demon. Meanwhile, Angela attempts to seduce the others. Maddie and Colin leave to find another exit, closely followed by Jason who flees when Angela attempts to seduce him. They are unable to find another exit and begin to head back to the house. Angela succeeds in luring Suzanne into a surrounding room where she proceeds to dance with her, eventually showing herself as a demon, before ripping off Suzanne's breasts and face, turning her into a demon. Upon returning to the mansion, Jason goes to the bathroom where he comes upon Lily acting strangely, only to then witness her pressing her lipstick into her breast then voiding it out through her vagina accompanied by prolific amounts of blood. He warns the others who do not believe him until a demonic Suzanne attacks them. Jason stabs her, yet there is little effect. Escaping, they run into the demonic Angela who stops them from leaving the house. They decide to leave through the house's escape tunnel. On their way, they arm themselves with a gun and a rusty metal bar. While in the tunnel, they discover the tunnel has caved in, before being attacked by Lily and Dex. They manage to fend off the demons, however Jason succumbs to a severe injury on his leg. The survivors run into an upstairs room and tend to Jason's injury. They realize that not only are they in the maid's room but that the symbols remained on the walls under a layer of plaster. They also discover that the demons are attempting to take over seven human hosts to be freed upon the earth, having been thrown out of hell for trying to usurp Satan's rule. They also discover that the demons tricked Evangeline into hosting the party so they could take over the guests and that the demons can't take over a dead body, which is why Evangeline hung herself. They also find out that the demons don't like rust, finding that they can use it as a weapon. As the boys fall asleep, Angela taunts Maddie, however she is unable to enter the room due to the spells. Suddenly the walls begin pouring with blood, washing off the spells. The trio attempt to re-draw them onto the walls as the demons hands puncture through the walls. They manage to defeat the demons by re-drawing the spells, however are lured out of the room by the demons who fake daylight in the windows. They realize it is not daylight, before the demons attack them. Maddie and Colin rush back to the room, however Jason is caught and disemboweled by Angela, turning him into a demon. As Maddie grieves her friends, Colin is attacked by Dex in the attached bathroom, allowing the pair to realize the bathroom is not protected by the spell.

Even at the time of his niece Princess Zeila's upcoming thirteenth birthday, the people were happier still. However, the tyrant Sheikh Jafar, and his shadow of a magician, Burk, have other plans, in order to take over Oman's kingdom. After a lovely performance by Princess Zeila and her snake charmer friend Amin, a messenger attempts to give a proclamation, written by Oman's information minister, Tonko, to the princes from the three cities across the river. However, before the messenger could get any further, Burk turns him into stone. Later, after Amin charms a few snakes, his Magpie, Calina, attempts to steal one of Amin's bells after breaking her promise while working on a tambourine. He not only attended Princess Zeila's next performance at the palace; he applied the music for it. After the performance, Jafar, who also attended, attempts to propose to Zeila, but Caliph Oman's ministers, Tonko, Zirko, and Zizibe, think otherwise, even Amin, who later overhears that Burk has put an infatuation spell on Jafar's ring, making anyone who wears it fall in love with him. Later that night, Amin and Calina try to keep hidden from sight at Jafar's palace, stealing the magic ring. Jafar had informed Burk of the magpie's thievery, and Burk announces his plan to his master. Back at Oman's palace, Amin tells the ministers that he will bring the ring to them, and that they would give the ring to the ugliest woman they could find. The following morning, Zeila was at the palace singing. Amin tries to warn Zeila about Jafar's plan, that is, until Burk kidnaps him. A trial is held in favor of Amin's absence, and his mother is heartbroken. Calina, restless that Amin has not returned, sets out to find him. After Burk takes the ring away from Amin, Calina arrives and attempts to take the ring back. However, Burk throws Calina at a wall and fatally wounds her. The ministers attempt to find Amin's trail, but take a break at a crystal stream and drink the water there. However, Burk places a spell on the water, turning the old ministers into babies. The woman who gathers water there cradles them, singing a lullaby to them. Vowing not to let Calina die in vein, Amin tears off part of a sleeping Burk's cloak, trying his best not to wake him up, and flies out of the palace. The magician wakes up and is informed about his cloak, and takes off after Amin. The two engage in an air duel, and after Burk takes the torn part of his cloak back, Amin falls into a stream. Burk attempts to find Amin, but with no luck. Amin comes out of the river, only to find that Zeila had become infatuated with Jafar and is wearing the magic ring. Heartbroken, he calls to his old beggar friend Fatima, who gives him Aladdin's lamp as a parting gift. Amin rubs the lamp, and a genie comes out. Amin wishes to see his mother, but first, the genie takes them both to Jafar's palace to face Burk one last time. With Burk defeated, the messenger has returned to life, the magic ring disintegrated, and the ministers are old men again. The genie has also resurrected Calina, making Amin happy. Back at Oman's palace, Zeila admits that she loves Amin to Jafar, who is about to have his guard take Zeila as prisoner. Amin arrives in time to save Zeila, and, with a little help from the genie, he uses his snake charmer's flute to lure Jafar and his guard to dance into the river. With Zeila and Amin together again, peace is restored in Baghdad. The city rejoiced upon celebrating the marriage of Princess Zeila and Amin. As the narrator of the story puts it, love triumphed over hate, right over wrong, and good over evil.

Their love for each other is palpable as they lie in bed treasuring their 6 month old daughter Quincey. Miranda fantasizes about the speech she plans to make when, one day in their future, she will give this tiny infant away at her wedding. Tragically, when Quincey is 3, Miranda is killed in a car accident and Rawdon is left alone, unmoored, to continue life without the love of his life. Fortunately Rawdon still has Quincey. Staying as strong as he can he takes her to the roof of a skyscraper and explains that Mommy is now an angel. It is up here that for the first time they see a vision of Miranda as an angel. Rawdon continues to see visions of her. Initially these visions help him—at home she gives him advice about parenting; in Portugal she softens his hardness; when he hides in the closet to isolate himself she snaps some sense into him and insists that Rawdon keep her mother, father and brother—Quincey's Grandparents  and Uncle Jack  – firmly in Quincey's life. Rawdon explains these visions to his therapist Paula  as she helps him with the long grieving process and over a period of years, with Quincey growing before our eyes, Rawdon tries to move on with his life. He tries to date other women. Disastrously. He falls instantly in love with Sam  who ends up becoming his good friend and a surrogate Aunt to Quincey. He dates other including Kimberly  who Quincey wisely suggests is far better suited to her Uncle Jack. And she is right. When Jack and Kimberly get married, Rawdon is their best man. All the while Miranda's metaphysical presence is with him. He goes from needing her, to blaming her, being angry at her. But for a long, long time he won't let her go away. Part of him wants her to stay alive in his imagination forever and gradually this presence that helped him initially eventually becomes an impediment to his moving on in life. In contrast to her Dad's stagnation, Quincey is growing up fast , and in no time she is dating, stealing cars, trying to set her Dad up with her best friend's divorced Moms, going off to University and falling in love with a Frenchman named Philippe. It is not until Rawdon finally plucks up the courage to ask out somebody who might just be right for him that he finally, tearfully, asks Miranda to leave him. This is ultimately a coming of age story. We watch Quincey literally come of age whilst her father, emotionally, comes of age. He eventually gives up the now stultifying memory of his dead wife and arrives at a new beginning. The end of this story is also the beginning of another where Rawdon, surrounded by the people he loves—but without Miranda—finds himself giving Quincey away at her wedding to Philippe. And here he makes the speech that Miranda made in bed with him and Quincey so many years before.

In spite of this apparent direct path to success, Di Giorgio soon discovers that she does not fit the mold that Hollywood wants to place her in and she finds herself at a creative and personal cross road of being true to herself or being pigeon holed by an industry that tries to tell her who she is and who she should be. A major Hollywood executive tells her “I get you- you’re a young kid raised in the ghetto, you have a fire in your belly from all the hard times you have seen”, when in fact Maija went to boarding school in Greenwich Connecticut. The only ghetto Maija had ever seen was watching repeats of “GoodTimes”. Maija chooses to walk away from it all and start over. In a desperate attempt to salvage both career and sanity, Maija sets out to show the world just how twisted and masochistic her world of standup comedy really is. Maija who asks her soon to be boyfriend, Kenny Simmons who is determined to help Maija but also see himself back in a producer position, and he immediately begins to line up huge star talent and takes claim to the credits of producer, by his none stop attack on getting talent. Setting off this couple's tailspin journey, is a confrontation with Jerry Seinfeld on location of the star’s own project. This escapade results in a New York Post front-page headline and death threats forcing the camera toting couple to leave the city. Forging ahead with a dysfunctional crew, they crisscross the country, Maija in search of some answers and Kenny in search of fame and fortune. They convince a surprising birth of industry legends to sit down for the most revealing and awkward interviews of their careers. Maija and Kenny manage to record an eclectic borage of insightful, and yet sometimes absurd and irrelevant opinions. George Carlin, Chevy Chase, Phyllis Diller, Kevin James, Lewis Black, Rita Rudner, Ray Romano, Paul Mooney, and Richard Pryor are among a long list of celebrity comics harassed into being a part of this project. - When Kenny’s obsession with fame takes over Maija’s film and personal quest, she is forced to fight back or risk losing everything. Maija DiGiorgio’s is a familiar story of the tumultuous search for true identity. She shows us the emotional pain from which humor is born and the powerful role it plays in uplifting us and keeping us sane. In the wake of life’s greatest tragedies, the human spirit is transformed, and Maija has recorded the raw reality of its course.

Here Dilip meets Rananjay Singh “Ransa” , a prince who despises the ideologies of his father and the aristocracy. Ransa's straightforward and fearless personality has quite an effect on the mild-mannered Dilip. Shortly, Dilip visits the university hostel where he is ragged by a gang of university thugs, led by Jadwal . They strip him and lock him in a room with Anuja , a young lecturer in the same university. Both Dilip and Anuja are released naked. Dilip's brother tells him to ignore the event and that things were the same in his days, effectively stating that the society as a whole hasn’t changed much since his time. But Ransa disagrees and tells Dilip that they should avenge this act. Initially, Dilip is reluctant but finally gives in and goes along with Ransa, after Ransa provokes him to give the thugs a taste of their own medicine. But the tables are turned and both Dilip and Ransa are beaten and are ragged and thrown out of the hostel. Ransa meets Dukey Bana , a local figure who is trying to gather support for the Rajputana separatist movement, who allows them to proceed with the plan to injure Jadwal. Ransa and Dilip ambush Jadwal, but the other thugs corner them in a cinema hall. Dukey Bana interferes and rescues them. Dukey Bana then convinces Ransa to in the General Secretary Elections at the university. Running against Ransa is his father's out-of-wedlock daughter, Kiran . Ransa is kidnapped by his father's out-of-wedlock son Karan , who asks him to withdraw from the elections. Ransa mocks him and Karan kills him. Taking advantage of the situation, Dukey Bana makes Dilip to take Ransa's place in the election. The chances of Dilip winning are minimal, so Dukey Bana bribes the electoral panel to rig the count in Dilip's favour. Dilip wins the election to become the general secretary. Kiran then seduces Dilip and convinces him to allow her to become the cultural secretary. Dukey Bana then starts using the funds for the Rajputana separatist movement. When Dilip finds out about this he goes to confront Dukey Bana about the funds. Bana lets Dilip know about the movement and tells him that the funds are being used for it. Dilip is not convinced and tries to reason with Bana. A frustrated Bana takes him to his country estate where his thugs have killed Jadwal and shows him the body to intimidate him. Anuja, is thrown out of the hostel and moves in with Dilip. Kiran gets pregnant and is angry with Dilip for being careless about it. She gets an abortion and leaves Dilip. Anuja tries to make Dilip understand that Kiran has no interest in leading a married life and leaves him. A frustrated Dilip resigns from his post and Kiran steps in. She then tries to seduce Dukey Bana, but she fails when Bhati , Dukey's second-in-command, comes looking for Dukey. In a private meeting, an irate Dukey threatens Karan and Kiran by telling them that the only reason they're alive is because of their links to the local king. Dilip, blinded by his love for Kiran, becomes violent and aggressive. Anuja also decides to leave him. Meanwhile Dilip finds out about Kiran from Bana's mistress, Madhuri . He grabs a gun, goes to Bana's house and shoots him. While dying, Bana tells him that Kiran used Dilip to get to him. At the same time, Karan reveals to his group of thugs that once Dukey Bana is out of the way, the Rajputana movement will have no choice but to choose Karan as its new leader and therefore legitimize his royal status. They conclude that to get rid of Dukey, they must first eliminate Bhati. Dilip wants to hear the truth from Kiran, so he tells Bhati to get her on the phone. Kiran refuses to answer, so Bhati goes off to find her and is killed by Karan's thugs. Dilip comes to meet Kiran who tells him that all she wanted to was use him to become general secretary. Dilip rejects her explanation and almost shoots her but gets shot by thugs. Despite his injuries, Dilip walks back to his house and dies there. The film ends with Karan as the head of the Rajputana movement, while Kiran sheds a tear as one of the loyal faithful. Parallel to the plot there is an interesting character of Dukey Bana's brother Prithvi Bana played by Piyush Mishra. He wears bizarre dress and seems as psychic, though talks very satirically and often abused and slapped by Dukey banna for this. It is told in flashback that he was once a guitarist in his young days. Along with him there is a person characterized as Ardhanarishvara, who is killed by Dukey Bana mistakenly when Dukey Bana was outraged with his brother and aims to shoot him and misses.

Jayakrishnan wants to be Ashokan's bodyguard, but Ashokan does not need a bodyguard. Later, Jayakrishnan approaches Ashokan with a recommendation from someone he cannot refuse. He achieves his luck after saving Ashokan from danger. Jayakrishnan thus becomes the bodyguard of Ashokan's only daughter Ammu . Jayakrishnan follows Ammu to her college as her bodyguard. Ammu and her friend Sethulakshmi  gets irritated with him following them all day. Jayakrishnan takes his role as bodyguard very seriously and follows the two girls around constantly. In an attempt to get rid of him, Ammu and Sethulakshmi make up a ""fake lover"" hoping to distract Jayakrishnan from his duties as a bodyguard. It works! Jayakrishnan falls in love with ""PRIVATE NUMBER"", and is constantly looking for this girl. He has no idea that his lover is Ammu. Ammu, as a joke, calls Jayakrishnan and speaks badly about Ammu. Jayakrishnan gets a little angry and disagrees with her. He believes Ammu is a good-hearted person. That's when the viewer is able to tell Ammu is really falling in love with Jayakrishnan. This is no joke anymore. Ammu, later tells Jayakrishnan to run away with her and meet her at a railroad station. Jayakrishnan agrees, not knowing that the girl is Ammu. Ashokan finds out and he believes that Jayakrishnan and Ammu are planning to run away together. In order to save Jayakrishnan's life, Ammu lies that it's not her. That Jayakrishnan is meeting another girl at the station. Ashokan lets Jayakrishnan go, but tells others to kill Jayakrishnan if a girl does not show up. Terrified, Ammu sends her friend, Sethulakshmi, to the station and tells her to tell Jayakrishnan that Ammu is the lover and she won't be able to make it to the station. Sethulakshmi, seeing Jayakrishnan, falls in love, and admits that she is the lover, not Ammu. Ammu calls her twice, but Sethulakshmi throws the cellphone out, trying to erase Ammu out of their love life completely. Years later, after Jayakrishnan and Sethulakshmi's marriage, she bore a son. Before her death, she leaves a diary for her son telling the whole story between the phone calls and his father and Ammu. The son later goes to Ammu's house with Jayakrishnan to visit Ashokan. Jayakrishnan is shocked Ammu isn't married. The son asks Ammu to become his mother and Jayakrishnan is shocked and angry at his son for saying something so blunt and rude. But Ashokan begs Jayakrishnan to take Ammu as his wife. So they go onto the train together but the son runs and throws the diary into a trashcan nearby. Jayakrishnan finds the diary and realizes that his real lover, the girl who's waited for him for so many years faithfully, was Ammu. And they live happily ever after."

Though hesitant, the old lady takes them to their rooms. Marty and Jenny argue in their bedroom, while Chrissy goes down the hallway to take a bath since the plumbing in their rooms is obsolete. While in the bathtub, Chrissy is attacked by one of the old woman's sons, and held underwater until she becomes unconscious. A restless Jenny goes to check on Chrissy, but the candle-lit bathroom is empty; Jenny then runs into the old woman, and they speak for a few minutes about the hotel and her sons; she says ambiguously that she's ""getting too old for it"". Marty then stumbles upon the conversation, and they part ways. Meanwhile, Chrissy's attacker carries her to the basement of the hotel, where he slits her throat and then leaves her body in a igloo-like freezer. Marty and Jenny retire to their rooms, and Jenny awakens in the middle of the night. She leaves her room again, and hears the old woman talking to someone downstairs. She walks to the end of the hallway to the stairwell, and peers down to see the old lady talking to her son, saying, ""It's done, isn't it?"". The next morning, Marty goes outside to the snowmobiles to try and start them, but they still fail to turn on. Jenny gets dressed and goes downstairs, where Marty is arguing with the old woman in the kitchen — Chrissy is nowhere to be seen, and he suspects the snowmobiles have been tampered with. Marty goes outside the hotel to an old shed to look for tools, while Jenny stays in the kitchen with the old woman. The woman offers Jenny tea, which she accepts. Over tea, Jenny inquires about Chrissy's disappearance, but the old woman is evasive. Jenny returns to the front lounge room of the hotel, where she grows tired and begins to fall unconscious; it seems she has been drugged. She awakens in the basement, where she finds a book on Native American folklore, which explains that a windigo is often ""kept"" by an old woman who had the power passed on to her from another. In the basement, she finds the freezer where Chrissy's body was priorly left; she opens it, revealing a growling, beast-like man—it is revealed that he is the old woman's second son, a human Windigo. The other son comes down to the basement with a chainsaw, and chases Jenny throughout the hotel, up into the attic. Jenny exits through a window onto a small balcony; she manages to push the man over, where he is impaled on an iron fence below. Jenny finds Marty outside, who appears to be possessed and is rambling to himself. He wanders off into the woods, and Jenny returns to the hotel. Meanwhile, the storekeeper from the beginning of the film arrives at the hotel in search of the trio; almost immediately after entering, he is stabbed to death by the old woman. Jenny re-enters the hotel, where she finds the old woman's son's body, which has been dragged into the foyer. She finds a shotgun in a storage room, and is confronted by the knife-wielding old woman, who claims she is Jenny's dead mother. Jenny shoots her in the chest, killing her. After shooting the woman, Jenny seems to be overtaken by something; she goes to the basement and visits the windigo in the freezer, saying, ""It's all right, Jenny will look after you now."" She goes outside and finds Marty's lifeless body, but has no reaction to it; ""I'll come back for you, Marty"", she says, sweetly. The film ends with Jenny sitting in a lounge chair in front of the fire that night; the old woman's voice says in her head, ""You've done good. You'll be fine... I'll look after you, you know I will. It'll be like it always was. You'll see""."

She hits a bad bump driving home drunk on a dark road. Later, hearing noises in the garage, she finds a bleeding man, mangled and impaled on her jeep's bumper. Not calling 911, she tries to help, but he suddenly attacks. Panicked, she hits him with a golf club. After, she buries his body in a shallow grave in the woods off Clover Rd. The next day, Mary covers up the crime ; she scrubs off the blood but doesn't get the dent fixed . Mary starts coming apart. Irrational, she crashes on a tree to camouflage the small dent with a bigger. Later the news reveals the missing man is kindergarten teacher Timothy Emser , bipolar and unstable when he vanished. Strange things occur in Mary's house, making her feel toyed with by someone unseen; she descends into paranoia. It transpires that Rick , her boyfriend, gets involved in the cover up and goes to retrieve incriminatory evidence  off the corpse, but is killed, replaced in Emser's grave. It becomes clear Emser survived. Unhinged, he returns to make Mary live through the same nightmare she inflicted on him. He stalks Mary many ways. The parrots squawk strange phrases, which alert Mary. At one point, she falls down the stairs, impaling a screw driver in her thigh. Emser surprise attacks, biting and stabbing her, and she passes out. In a reversal, when Mary revives, Emser has strapped her to the bumper with electric cords and Christmas lights and takes her on a sadistic, all-night ""revenge drive"". Along the way, after a struggle, Emser kills a gas attendant  by pumping petrol down his throat. Emser parks back at his own house, leaving Mary trapped in his garage, as she did to him. He reunites with his worried family, but is ever more delusional, violent. Soon, Emser murders his wife Jane when she accidentally stumbles on and tries to untie Mary. It transpires that Emser goes to bury Mary in the woods with Rick's body, after detaching her and the bumper using a blowtorch and welding mask. However, in the grave, Mary is able to maim his eye with a plug from the cords and escapes in the jeep. When Emser blocks her path, Mary revs up and intentionally hits her tormentor several times. She speeds off in the dark. Next morning, Mary wakes on the roadside, numb and battered, and drives to a local auto shop. There, the mechanic and passersby ultimately discover, and pull out, Emser's body from under the jeep, where it got snagged. Seeing this, Mary has a mental breakdown, saying ""I don't think I need that bumper anymore"", laughing as the police sirens close in on her. The film ends moving closer to Emser's bloodied face on the pavement in the early rain, and it appears to be left uncertain whether he is actually dead or not. Throughout the narrative, a radio DJ called Eddie the Spaz is periodically heard, hosting a weekend music marathon, the ""Spazathon"", which bookends the film. The film is loosely inspired by an urban legend.{{cite web}}"

A long tracking shot follows his release from the stockade as the music becomes the Dies Irae and the screen credits roll. When the United States gets involved in the war, Gifford's National Guard unit is called to active service with the United States Army. Gifford's father-in-law is the Colonel ([[Robert Keith  commanding his regiment. Despite Gifford's wealth and commanding position in civilian life, he is not a commissioned officer but a platoon sergeant. As opposed to his callous treatment of sharecroppers viewed in flashback, Gifford becomes friends with three privates in his platoon whose company he prefers over those of his own rank. Though capably leading his platoon earns him a Silver Star medal for valour, Gifford outwardly shows signs of fear, battle fatigue, and neurosis. These weaknesses intensify when his father-in-law is killed. When a frightened lieutenant machine guns his three friends out of panic and inexperience, Gifford attempts to beat him to death with his rifle butt. Gifford is subdued, reduced in rank to private, and imprisoned. Gifford is summoned by Lt. Colonel Miles . Because he had earned a Silver Star, he is given a choice of being sentenced to the United States Disciplinary Barracks in Leavenworth or transferred to George Company, a de facto punishment company assigned to a dangerous area of the front lines. Gifford chooses the punishment company, which is commanded by Captain Grimes, a former First Sergeant . Captain Grimes insists everyone call him ""Waco"", wears no rank insignia and forbids military salutes lest he become a target for snipers. Everyone in George Company hates Waco except for some pre-war regular army comrades-in-arms , who act as Waco's personal bodyguards. Impressed by Gifford's combat record, Waco offers him a membership in his private circle as a radio operator. This ends when Gifford beats up Homeier for making remarks about his wife's photograph. Waco burns the photograph and exiles him to a forward platoon on outpost duty under the leadership of a lieutenant called Little Joe . Gifford forms a friendship with former sharecropper Willie Crawford . Gifford is sent back to company HQ with reports for Waco from Little Joe. Upon returning to the company Gifford is later tasked by Waco with leading a small six man patrol to check a town near the front lines. It is a dangerous assignment but Gifford executes it well. The patrol finds the town abandoned. Gifford takes a small sign off the front door of the town's church. The sign names the church and the town. While returning to their unit Gifford and his men spot a platoon strength Japanese Imperial Army unit armed with mortars heading back towards the hills near George Company's Headquarters. Gifford reports his findings to Waco. Waco accuses Gifford of not going to the town but hiding in the hills. Gifford tosses the sign from the town's church on Waco's desk. Then the headquarters receives a heavy artillery barrage from the Japanese mortars that Gifford warned Waco about. After the attack Waco apologizes to Gifford and commends him for his leadership on the patrol. Waco is then shot and killed by a Japanese sniper for returning a salute from some of his soldiers. Gifford leads several soldiers back up to Little Joe's platoon as reinforcements. They beat off several enemy attacks. Eventually after the last attack Gifford and Crawford are the sole survivors. With Crawford wounded in the leg, Crawford orders Gifford make it through the lines alone to warn the Company of an impending large attack. At first Gifford refuses to leave Crawford behind, but Crawford insists, pointing a pistol at Gifford and saying its an order. Gifford fights his way through Japanese soldiers to make his way back to the Company but he is wounded along the way. Upon reaching the company he finds that most of the Battalion has come up to begin a new offensive. Gifford warns them about the Japanese units that massing in the hills. He demands that help be sent to rescue Crawford. Just at that moment a patrol comes in with Crawford on a stretcher. Crawford and Gifford are told because of their wounds they are being shipped home. Gifford tells Crawford that he wants Crawford to live with him and his family at his mansion back home and he can have a job at Gifford's company."

An unenthusiastic Alex reluctantly agrees to tag along after a death-threatening situation in which Harper  and Alex were almost hit by a coming subway. Justin saves the two for a chance to be praised at using magic to save Alex once again after Alex does something wrong. Once in the Caribbean, the family meets a boy working at the hotel that Alex instantly develops a crush on. The family then visits a street fair, where they meet a street magician and former wizard   named Archie who wants to turn his girlfriend, Giselle, from a parrot back into a human by finding the Stone of Dreams, which has the power to grant any wish or reverse any spell. Jerry considers it crazy since many wizards have gone on the quest and never returned. Later, after Alex was about to use a spell on her mother to convince her to let Alex hang out with the boy from the hotel, she gets caught, grounded and forbidden to use magic for two months. After a heated argument with Theresa, Alex, in a fit of rage, wishes that her parents had never met. The smuggled full-wizard wand and spell book, which Alex was holding at the time, grants her wish. As a result, Jerry and Theresa do not remember Justin, Alex, Max, and they don't know each other. Alex, Max and Justin attempt to get a spell-book from Jerry by levitating it out of his pocket, but he catches it. Jerry is shown to still have his powers, since he never gave them up to marry Theresa. Jerry has a more carefree attitude with magic due to this change. Justin asks him ""hypothetically"" what would happen if a wizard wished that her parents never met. Jerry explains how they would gradually forget their past, and then disappear forever. He says it would take a miracle to fix it, whereupon Justin mentions the Stone of Dreams , which Jerry says would work too. Justin and Alex set off to find the Stone of Dreams, guided by Archie. Along the way, Justin and Alex face many obstacles such as getting across a wide canyon, escaping death from quicksand, and getting across a narrow ledge. Meanwhile, Max stays at the resort to keep his parents from meeting other people. Over the course of the day, Max begins losing his memory. Realizing that something is wrong, Max asks Jerry to help him find Alex and Justin, and Jerry agrees after some persuasion. They are joined by Theresa, who believes them to simply be treasure hunting, but nonetheless proves useful, as she is the only one of them who can speak Spanish. Eventually, Alex and Justin succeed in finding the Stone of Dreams, but Giselle steals the stone. The kids tell Theresa and Jerry their story. Theresa doesn't believe them because she thinks she would never forget her own children. While trying to figure out how to reverse the spell without the stone of dreams, Jerry mentions that if one of the kids was a full wizard, they might be able to cast a spell to reverse it. While preparing to begin the full-wizard contest, Max finally loses all memory of who he is and gets sucked into the vortex of non-existence. Theresa remembers him slightly, and realizes that they were telling the truth. Realizing they must work quickly, Alex and Justin are transported to an ancient battlefield, where the contest will be held. Jerry explains that they will only be allowed to use spells involving the four elements . The winner will become a full wizard, and the loser gets nothing while losing their powers forever. Alex and Justin engage in what turns out to be an intense battle, and Alex narrowly wins. In trying to come up with a spell to fix everything, she turns to Justin for help. However, Justin has lost all his memory . Alex tells him that even though they pick on each other, she looks up to him and begs Justin not leave her here alone. Justin tells her that he'd never leave her and that even though he doesn't know her, he believes her, and wants to help, but he cannot and is sucked into the same vortex that Max was. Meanwhile Theresa is back at the resort and sees that Giselle has returned to human form with the Stone of Dreams hanging by her neck. She wanted to leave Archie now that she was in human form. Archie manages to get the stone from Giselle, turns her back into a parrot, and gives the stone to Theresa. Theresa then wishes to be where Alex, Justin and Jerry are, at which point she is transported to the same battlefield and gives Alex the stone. Jerry tells Alex she can wish for her brothers to reappear and still keep her full wizard powers. However, Alex wishes that everything go back to the way it was before, and time rewinds back to the beginning of the argument between Alex and Theresa that started all the trouble, which is quickly stopped when Alex apologizes and accepts her punishments with grace. While Theresa and Jerry remember nothing about the ordeal, Alex, Justin, and Max do. Their parents are astonished by the change in the kids' attitude."

As a result, Jerry and Theresa do not remember Justin, Alex, Max, and they don't know each other. Alex, Max and Justin attempt to get a spell-book from Jerry by levitating it out of his pocket, but he catches it. Jerry is shown to still have his powers, since he never gave them up to marry Theresa. Jerry has a more carefree attitude with magic due to this change. Justin asks him ""hypothetically"" what would happen if a wizard wished that her parents never met. Jerry explains how they would gradually forget their past, and then disappear forever. He says it would take a miracle to fix it, whereupon Justin mentions the Stone of Dreams , which Jerry says would work too. Justin and Alex set off to find the Stone of Dreams, guided by Archie. Along the way, Justin and Alex face many obstacles such as getting across a wide canyon, escaping death from quicksand, and getting across a narrow ledge. Meanwhile, Max stays at the resort to keep his parents from meeting other people. Over the course of the day, Max begins losing his memory. Realizing that something is wrong, Max asks Jerry to help him find Alex and Justin, and Jerry agrees after some persuasion. They are joined by Theresa, who believes them to simply be treasure hunting, but nonetheless proves useful, as she is the only one of them who can speak Spanish. Eventually, Alex and Justin succeed in finding the Stone of Dreams, but Giselle steals the stone. The kids tell Theresa and Jerry their story. Theresa doesn't believe them because she thinks she would never forget her own children. While trying to figure out how to reverse the spell without the stone of dreams, Jerry mentions that if one of the kids was a full wizard, they might be able to cast a spell to reverse it. While preparing to begin the full-wizard contest, Max finally loses all memory of who he is and gets sucked into the vortex of non-existence. Theresa remembers him slightly, and realizes that they were telling the truth. Realizing they must work quickly, Alex and Justin are transported to an ancient battlefield, where the contest will be held. Jerry explains that they will only be allowed to use spells involving the four elements . The winner will become a full wizard, and the loser gets nothing while losing their powers forever. Alex and Justin engage in what turns out to be an intense battle, and Alex narrowly wins. In trying to come up with a spell to fix everything, she turns to Justin for help. However, Justin has lost all his memory . Alex tells him that even though they pick on each other, she looks up to him and begs Justin not leave her here alone. Justin tells her that he'd never leave her and that even though he doesn't know her, he believes her, and wants to help, but he cannot and is sucked into the same vortex that Max was. Meanwhile Theresa is back at the resort and sees that Giselle has returned to human form with the Stone of Dreams hanging by her neck. She wanted to leave Archie now that she was in human form. Archie manages to get the stone from Giselle, turns her back into a parrot, and gives the stone to Theresa. Theresa then wishes to be where Alex, Justin and Jerry are, at which point she is transported to the same battlefield and gives Alex the stone. Jerry tells Alex she can wish for her brothers to reappear and still keep her full wizard powers. However, Alex wishes that everything go back to the way it was before, and time rewinds back to the beginning of the argument between Alex and Theresa that started all the trouble, which is quickly stopped when Alex apologizes and accepts her punishments with grace. While Theresa and Jerry remember nothing about the ordeal, Alex, Justin, and Max do. Their parents are astonished by the change in the kids' attitude."

However, he fails to sell anything to anyone. But after hearing a radio report declaring that the mirthless buzzsaw tycoon J.P. Cubish is offering a one million dollar reward to anyone who can make him laugh  before he passes on, Daffy promptly sets off for the millionaire's home with dollar signs in his eyes. Upon arriving at Cubish's mansion, Daffy finds that the butler  is not willing to let him in. Daffy tries several ways to get inside , all of which end in failure . Daffy finally sneaks into the house by hiding in a package designed to look like a bottle of champagne . Daffy runs for his life as the butler tries to kill him with an axe and the duck tries to escape via a dumb waiter. Daffy narrowly avoids a cannon blast which destroys the dumb waiter and climbs further, only to confront the butler . As the incensed butler swears he'll get rid of Daffy permanently, the wily duck starts interrogating the butler ala Humphrey Bogart , accusing him of not wanting Cubish to return to his good health . He proceeds to accuse the astounded butler of attempted murder , eventually asiding to the audience, ""Phew! What's Humphrey Bogart got that I ain't got?"". Having frightened the butler into incoherence, Daffy tricks him into fleeing the house in disguise, so as not to be arrested.  At last, Daffy makes it to Cubish's bedroom, but before he can even unpack his novelty items, he slips and falls on a tray of food, covering himself in cake.

The victim, Paul Pelikan, drowns before he can be rescued. People in the Bella Donna's home port of Gibraltar suspect that the Skipper deliberately pushed Paul overboard because he'd had an affair with the Skipper's wife Mona . Though nothing is proven, Mona believes the Skipper did in fact throw Paul overboard and leaves him. Heartbroken, the Skipper spends most of his time at the local bars getting drunk and swearing he will sail again, though the townspeople don't take his claim seriously. Meanwhile, two English girls Su  and Lou  are barely making a living singing at local clubs. Though fast friends, there seems to be tension between the two. They put on a show at the California Bar that night, singing an English language version of Porque te vas . The Skipper is present for the performance and falls hard for the two, especially after Lou performs an impromptu striptease at the end. After spending the night with the two girls, the Skipper agrees to their request to sail them to Barbados. Though the voyage will take four weeks, all seems to be well at the start. The Skipper does express some concern in his ship's log about how close the two girls are, then injects himself with a syringe. As time passes, Su flirts with the Skipper, but becomes upset when her advances are ignored. As tensions further mount, Su snoops through the Skipper's quarters and finds the syringe and his log book. She tells Lou that she thinks the Skipper is a drug addict and a murderer, then confronts the Skipper at dinner later. He responds by throwing Su overboard. Angry, Su hides what she thinks are the Skipper's narcotics but is in fact insulin. Soon, the Skipper falls into a diabetic coma. A desperate Lou eventually finds the inuslin and injects the Skipper, saving his life. A grateful Skipper later confesses his love for Lou. Lou responds ""What about Su?"" The Skipper replies ""What about Su?"" Su then walks in on them having sex. Su is heartbroken and starts crying. Lou, feeling guilty, tries to comfort Su. Things seem to have smoothed over at the end, when the girls reprise their act, singing ""You're Leaving Me"" again. Without warning, Lou shoots the Skipper with a spear gun, killing him almost instantly. In terror, Su flees below deck. Lou takes a moment to draw a heart and arrow in the Skipper's pooling blood before going to the galley to make a cup of tea. She seems oddly calm while Su is quaking in terror over what's happened. Lou tries to calm Su down but ends up smothering her with a pillow. An end title states that the Bella Donna was later found adrift, with no one aboard."

According to the narrator, there is no known cure and very few survivors left fighting ""Against the Dark"". The first few scenes are used to establish the main characters, with Seagal playing a tough guy in charge of a group of vampire hunters. The survivors in the hospital are shown to be scared, isolated and untrusting. As the characters work their way through the hospital, they drift apart numerous times, often getting lost and attacked. . To make matters worse for the survivors, a massive army base is planning to sterilize the area at dawn. The survivors explain that there is only one functioning exit from the hospital  and they have to get to this exit before the emergency power runs out and they are shut inside. To make matters worse many of the stairways and elevators are blocked off, forcing them to make their way level by level, finding a way to the next one down to gain the exit. Meanwhile, Cross  tries to prevent Lt. Waters  from unleashing a bombing raid on the hospital. Some survivors and a hunter are killed and one is infected as they make their way out of the hospital. A survivor is captured by a human to be fed on by his infected daughter, but is rescued by Tao . As the humans make their way out a horde of infected chase them. As they exit the hospital just in time before the power fails the vampires become trapped inside. The surviving humans then run as jet planes bomb the forsaken hospital."

19715The film opens at a school where a boy is picking on another boy. We see Gracie Hart as a child who beats up the bully and tries to help the victim , who instead criticizes her by saying he disliked her because he did not want a girl to help him. She promptly punches the boy in the nose and sulks in the playground. We go forward in time to when Gracie Hart  is working for the Federal Bureau of Investigation with Eric Matthews  as a Special Agent. She is on a mission when she does not follow orders from her superior and tries to stop their target from choking. Because of her actions, one of her squad gets shot, and she is put on a desk job. The bureau receives a threat against the 75th annual Miss United States beauty pageant in San Antonio, Texas, from notorious domestic terrorist ""The Citizen"". Eric is elected to lead the mission to stop the attack. A computer search identifies Hart as the female FBI agent best qualified to go undercover as a contestant, although she pays little attention to her femininity. Beauty pageant coach Victor Melling , whose reputation was ruined after his last contestant criticized his methods, teaches the tomboyish Hart how to dress, walk, and act like a contestant. She is unused to such behavior, however, and sees the pageant and its participants as ""outdated and antifeminist"". Representing New Jersey as ""Gracie Lou Freebush"", Hart impresses the audience by playing the glass harp and demonstrating self-defense techniques during the talent competition. She unexpectedly becomes friends with Frasier and the other contestants. Several suspects exist, including competition director and former pageant winner Kathy Morningside ; her unpleasant assistant Frank Tobin ; veteran emcee Stan Fields  who, like Morningside, is being replaced with a younger person; and Rhode Island's Cheryl Frasier , possibly a radical animal rights activist. The Citizen is caught elsewhere, but Hart is beginning to suspect Kathy Morningside and is worried about the safety of the girls. She gives up her badge and gun and continues the investigation alone. Matthews, after failing to support Hart, is about to leave for the bureau when he works out that Hart's suspicions were correct, and returns to help her. Hart surprises everyone, including herself, by becoming runner-up to Frasier. The agents discover that Morningside and Tobin&mdash;secretly her son&mdash;impersonated Citizen due to her old grudge against the contest, and are attempting to murder Frasier with a bomb in the title tiara.

With nowhere to go she stays with Boota.  The villagers objects that he can't keep her home like that: He should either marry her or leave her in a camp, where people bound for Pakistan live. Boota decides that, since he is far older, he should leave her at the camp. He is about to send her off with a man bound for the camp and who is prepared to marry her there. Zainab, who has learned about the sacrifice he made for her and is touched by his simplicity, asks Boota if he is so poor that he cannot even feed her two rotis per day to keep her alive. Boota Singh and Zainab fall in love and get married. Boota's life transforms overnight. Then they have a baby girl.

In Boota's absence police forcibly dump Zainab into a truck bound for a refugee camp . And then Zainab is sent to her parents' village: Barki. Boota sells all his land and goes along with his child to Pakistan illegally. He is quickly arrested and brought before a judge who is quite willing to free him if his wife owns up.

Still youthful and attractive, she gives in to the wiles of one of the men in the neighbourhood, Lalit Ramji , and starts living with him. She has a daughter, Afsara  by him, and the three are portrayed as a happy family unit. One day, Lalit disappears without explanation, and from then on, the lives of the abandoned mother and daughter go steadily downward.

One of the poignant themes in the movie is Afsara's relationship with her father, to whose illusory love she hangs on with a childlike and, in the end, horribly unjustified faith. Learning that Lalit is now a successful politician, Afsara persuades her mother to travel to New Delhi to meet him as she is sure her father will rescue them from their terrible condition. Rejected, the mother returns, and having lost all hope and faith in human goodness, takes to drink. Soon after, she dies leaving her daughter aged 16 all alone.

Minutes later, residents report a ""meteor"" flying pasat the city and landing somewhere in the distant hills. Jack Weber, head of the Alpha Force, calls in Lieutenant Sean Lambert, the sole survivor of the first Alpha mission four years ago in Mexico. Lambert's entire team was killed while trying to capture a single specimen of extraterrestrial life. Now Weber wants Lambert to take a new team of interceptors into Russia to capture this new alien specimen. Lambert and the Alpha Force fly to Grozny. The new team consists of science officer Dawn DeSilva and Special Ops soldiers Bjorn Hatch, Nathan McAllister and Adriana Sikes. They find the wreckage of the alien spacecrafts outside a Russian nuclear plant. Holes blasted in the razor fencing and thick concrete walls suggest the alien is inside. The Alpha Force enters the nuclear plant and seal off the exits, creating a trap for the alien. But then, one by one, the team is killed off by a creature that possesses a laser weapon, can change its appearance, and can also regenerate itself completely from a single piece of alien tissue. Additionally, the alien has found a way to explode all the uranium fuel rods in the nuclear plant to create a lethal radiation cloud over Europe that will quickly spread and cover the rest of the world. Lambert and the remaining Alpha Force have 60 minutes to save themselves, and the Earth, from nuclear doom."

One day, as she's out for some physiotherapy treatment, he messes up her house while searching for a book about angels that he has lent her but that she has not read. Frightening the neighbors, he is taken by the police to a hospital, where an angry Jane briefly visits. The following night, Joey escapes from his room and comes back to his friend's house in order to tidy it as she sleeps. While he cleans everything up, he finds a letter from her young son inviting her to his upcoming communion in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where he lives with his adoptive family. Later on, as she has woken up, he asks her if he can spend the night on the couch. In the morning, the police knock on Jane's door and ask her if the escapee is in her house. She hesitates but eventually tells them that he's left. Decided not to go back to the psychiatric hospital nor to prison, Joey then begs Jane to join him on a planned trip to New Orleans, where a celebrated author writing about angels is due to hold a conference. Soon after they start driving, problems begin. Their engine heats up and their car explodes. They buy a new one but this one is stolen. They then board a coach and, while Jane sleeps, Joey meets a young lady called Billie by helping her find her wedding ring on the floor. She tells him her husband has disappeared without giving an address. Later on, the three passengers dine at Billie's sister with her friends. A romantic night follows and ends with fireworks. The next morning, Joey, Jane and Billie are driven to a restaurant by a relative, but Jane forgets her purse in the car. As nobody has enough money for the bill, Joey elaborates a plan to get them to the bus without paying. The plan does not work but they eventually get into the bus, where they argue about what they've just done. The bus driver abandons them on a road in the middle of nowhere. Jane decides to go back home and Joey has to reveal the existence of her son's letter. At night, the three hear music and meet Caldwell, an old musician with whom they share some cake enhanced with drugs. The following day, Caldwell gives them a lift, as Jane reluctantly agrees to replace a singer who was due to sing two songs in a restaurant. In town, shortly before her planned show, Jane argues with Joey about his mothering her. She leaves the group and meets fellow travelers going to Iowa. The woman of the couple is ill and they are going their on their last trip to their children. This inspiring meeting persuades Jane to perform the show she was supposed to be at. She arrives on stage while Joey prays angels for her to come back. She sings ""This Land Is Your Land"" accompanied by Caldwell on electric guitar, to applause from the public in the club. After the concert, as they drive towards New Orleans, they notice their stolen car on the road and chase the thief. An accident ensues and everybody is arrested and subsequently freed except Caldwell who is taken to prison. Jane manages to give him a song written for him, where she stresses the beauty of birds. In New Orleans, Joey attends the conference about angels but discovers, while in the toilet, that the author is both a racist and a liar. He does not believe in what he writes and hates his Black and Mexican readership. Joey punches him in the face and the three travelers are expelled from the conference. They get to the train station and are bound to Baton Rouge when Billie receives a call. Her husband is on the phone and seems ready to come back home.

One day, as she's out for some physiotherapy treatment, he messes up her house while searching for a book about angels that he has lent her but that she has not read. Frightening the neighbors, he is taken by the police to a hospital, where an angry Jane briefly visits. The following night, Joey escapes from his room and comes back to his friend's house in order to tidy it as she sleeps. While he cleans everything up, he finds a letter from her young son inviting her to his upcoming communion in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where he lives with his adoptive family. Later on, as she has woken up, he asks her if he can spend the night on the couch. In the morning, the police knock on Jane's door and ask her if the escapee is in her house. She hesitates but eventually tells them that he's left. Decided not to go back to the psychiatric hospital nor to prison, Joey then begs Jane to join him on a planned trip to New Orleans, where a celebrated author writing about angels is due to hold a conference. Soon after they start driving, problems begin. Their engine heats up and their car explodes. They buy a new one but this one is stolen. They then board a coach and, while Jane sleeps, Joey meets a young lady called Billie by helping her find her wedding ring on the floor. She tells him her husband has disappeared without giving an address. Later on, the three passengers dine at Billie's sister with her friends. A romantic night follows and ends with fireworks. The next morning, Joey, Jane and Billie are driven to a restaurant by a relative, but Jane forgets her purse in the car. As nobody has enough money for the bill, Joey elaborates a plan to get them to the bus without paying. The plan does not work but they eventually get into the bus, where they argue about what they've just done. The bus driver abandons them on a road in the middle of nowhere. Jane decides to go back home and Joey has to reveal the existence of her son's letter. At night, the three hear music and meet Caldwell, an old musician with whom they share some cake enhanced with drugs. The following day, Caldwell gives them a lift, as Jane reluctantly agrees to replace a singer who was due to sing two songs in a restaurant. In town, shortly before her planned show, Jane argues with Joey about his mothering her. She leaves the group and meets fellow travelers going to Iowa. The woman of the couple is ill and they are going their on their last trip to their children. This inspiring meeting persuades Jane to perform the show she was supposed to be at. She arrives on stage while Joey prays angels for her to come back. She sings ""This Land Is Your Land"" accompanied by Caldwell on electric guitar, to applause from the public in the club. After the concert, as they drive towards New Orleans, they notice their stolen car on the road and chase the thief. An accident ensues and everybody is arrested and subsequently freed except Caldwell who is taken to prison. Jane manages to give him a song written for him, where she stresses the beauty of birds. In New Orleans, Joey attends the conference about angels but discovers, while in the toilet, that the author is both a racist and a liar. He does not believe in what he writes and hates his Black and Mexican readership. Joey punches him in the face and the three travelers are expelled from the conference.

The adult Dr. Gerald Bull's career as a successful large-bore gun designer takes a turn as he is defunded by the U.S. Army; he then produces weapons for China, Israel, and ultimately South Africa which results in his arrest and conviction for illegal arms dealing. After his release, Bull promotes his supergun idea to Saddam Hussein, and, with funding through BCCI, begins design work on the top secret project, ""Babylon"". Bull solves several manufacturing challenges by forging and assembling it in sections which are bolted together by flanges, and lining the relatively soft barrel material with an alloy sleeve to reduce wear on the barrel. British and U.S. government agencies are shown to be aware of Bull's activities, but do nothing to stop him. The Israeli Mossad tries to dissuade Bull, and goes so far as to threaten his life, with no effect. As the ""Baby Babylon"" version of the gun is assembled and tested successfully horizontally in Iraq, Bull's second in command, Cowley, quits after a roadside run-in with Mossad agent Dov, who also shadowed Bull. The Iraqis demand an additional, 45-degree, test of the prototype gun, using threats to coerce Bull into compliance. That completed test firing results in a direct hit on a target 100 miles away, and Bull brags that the full size ""Babylon"" gun can fire ""ten times as far."" As production of the full-size sections of the gun continues in England and elsewhere, falsely documented as oil pipeline parts in order to evade export restrictions, the film depicts increasing threats to Bull's life from Hussein, and the Mossad agent Dov. As the gun nears completion, Bull, while returning home, is gunned down at his apartment, where his body is discovered by his wife. The end text crawl states that Dr. Bull's murder was unsolved, and that the U.S. contributed over $3 billion to Iraq in the years preceding the first Gulf War."

While he has other friends, he prefers to keep company with his best friend Cleatus Poole , a goofball who is exactly the opposite type and prefers to say exactly what is on his mind, no matter the consequences. In other words, he is an extrovert, unlike his friend Pete. At the game, Pete runs into some frustration when his Biology teacher does not recognize him and when he finally approaches Cammie to ask her out, he struggles to get the words out, only to discover that she has a boyfriend, the captain of the basketball team Dill . Rejected, Pete goes home. His father tells him that to get Cammie's attention, he has to give her something to notice. On their way to the Brewster High basketball game, Cleatus comes over to ask Pete for a favor. He has two problems with being the mascot; the first is that few people seem to think that he is funny, and his lackluster performances only match the team's dismal performances on the court because the team is on a losing streak . Cleatus' second problem is that he has an allergy to the suit, which causes him to sneeze violently every time he puts it on. Uncomfortable with the sweating, congestion, and swelling joints that he gets whenever he dons the suit, he pleads for Pete to wear the chicken mascot suit instead. As part of the bargain, Cleatus tells Pete he will get his sister on a date with him, and he agrees. Pete's first game as ""The Chicken,"" gets off to a rocky start. He gets to the door and is knocked over, and initially wants to go home. However, when the audience  laugh at his recovery, he realizes he has gotten Cammie's attention and starts to be more adventurous inside the suit. The next day, Cleatus is congratulated on ""his"" performance as mascot, and finally noticed by his crush, head cheerleader Jamie Wynn , but he is nearly beaten up by the basketball team in retaliation from Pete's antics the night before. Before it gets out of hand, Cleatus is saved by Coach Mackey, who will be fired if there is no mascot. Afterwards, Cleatus comes to see Pete and asks him what he did. Because Pete cannot describe it, Cleatus decides Pete can still be the chicken while he hides in the stands. By hiding in plain sight , Cleatus can keep track of ""The Chicken's"" performances and be on standby if the two need to switch places in a hurry. During one of the biology lessons, Pete meets cheerleader Angela Morrisey  and starts crushing on her. They are both chosen for the parade float committee. Angela comes up with an idea for the upcoming float's theme using ""The Chicken"" as the centerpiece for a dance number with the cheerleading team and some children dressed like baby ""chicks"" who will hatch out of their shells. Even so, the project is ambitious logistically, so the two start trusting each other as Pete starts to find ways to make it work and build the actual props. The two start spending increasing amounts of free time together, initially talking about the float, but later sharing more personal details, becoming fast friends in the process. On the way to a mid-season game, the basketball team and the cheerleaders begin to wonder why ""The Chicken"" has suddenly gotten so good at working the crowd. In a close call, the team forces ""The Chicken"" to unmask on the bus, revealing a sneezing Cleatus underneath. Later, once Pete and Cleatus have switched outfits, Pete does a lengthy performance with the cheerleaders, and as he prepares to leave the court, notices that he is standing next to Angela. Realizing that while he sees her every day, as ""The Chicken"" he can be more aggressive with his affections, and pretends to ""kidnap"" her in front of the audience as one of his stunts, which the crowd cheers on.After a streak of games with building popularity for ""The Chicken"", Pete then notices that Cleatus is getting the perks of being the mascot, including Jamie Wynn, which angers him at first. As the two talk it over, they realize that they are both actually getting what they want out of the deal. Cleatus gets to keep the family tradition going and get the social perks, whereas Pete really enjoys being ""The Chicken"" and is surprised to discover his own sense of accomplishment and newfound confidence. During the game a player is about to run into the cheerleaders. Pete picks up Angela, like an impulse while Jamie is knocked over and then begins to cry because her nose is bleeding. As the first time that ""The Chicken""  has snubbed his ""girlfriend"" in favor of Angela, both Pete and Cleatus worry that they may have revealed too much. Afterward, Angela thanks Poole and is about to kiss him, but Pete stops it. Later, at the float committee, Angela is missing. Pete finds her crying. She got dumped in a text message. Later, the town shows up en masse for the festival and ""The Chicken"" is a big hit along with the float and the cheerleaders perform alongside Pete in a choreographed dance number. During the song, Cleatus  is pulled onto the float and his identity is accidentally revealed. With his parents in shock, and the townspeople slowly realizing that they have been fooled, the situation causes Pete to panic and he runs only to have almost the entire town in pursuit. Pete gets away by stealing the Sheriff's car, which was being used in the parade. He changes out of the suit and leaves it hidden away to rejoin the town. Shortly after, Angela sees him walking and offers him a ride. When the two talk, Pete considers coming clean when Angela expresses relief that ""The Chicken"" is not Cleatus after all because of her developing romantic feelings for whomever is inside. However, when she confesses that she is not sure about how finding out who is inside the suit will affect these feelings, Pete decides to keep the mystery alive by retiring. Meanwhile, Cleatus is being questioned by the sheriff about who was really in the suit. Cleatus doesn't confess and is confronted by his father, who is upset that his son has been lying. When Cleatus admits his allergy, his father forgives him, and reveals that he had the same allergies when he was ""The Chicken"" in high school. Instead of being disappointed, his father actually praises Cleatus for choosing not to suffer under the pressure and to find his own way out. Apparently, his father always felt like a coward for having continued despite the discomfort. Afterwards, Cleatus and Pete discuss the future of ""The Chicken."" Cleatus explains that Pete can continue if he wants to, but that they can leave it alone as a joke that they confess at a future date instead. Based on the adoration that the town shares for ""The Chicken"" and due to the financial incentives of having people attending the games, the sheriff decides to drop the charges to get the chicken to return, and the principal and basketball coach call an assembly to let ""The Chicken"" know that there will be no reprisals or formal charges. Pete considers revealing himself, but at the last second remembers that it might mean losing Angela's affections. The town is disappointed when ""The Chicken"" does not appear for the next game, but a local journalist gives him the chance to explain himself on television. When he does, he mentions that the magic might be gone, comparing his unmasking to that of The Lone Ranger once the mystery is gone, it does not come back. At this moment, Angela realizes that Pete is ""The Chicken,"" but chooses to do nothing. Pete does return during the final game with a high-flying wire stunt to rally both the players and the crowd. With the team facing an undefeated team , they are close to having their first victory in years. As ""The Chicken"" rallies the crowd and the team, they start fighting back and closing the gap. During a time out, the audience cheers for the chicken to remove the mascot head, and Pete, remembering what Cleatus said earlier about hiding in his ""shell"" forever or ""hatching"" decides to remove the mask and take his chances. As he removes the mask, Angela runs to him and helps revealing that she has known for a while and was hoping that he would reveal himself on his own. Pete is shocked that she knows, but grateful that she never pressured him. The crowd is initially silent, because no one recognizes him, until Cleatus yells, ""That's Pete Ivey!"" and the crowd cheers the instantly famous mascot. In the audience, Pete's parents are shocked and proud that it is their son, and Cleatus' father compliments them on how good Pete is in the role. The team finishes with a last second score to win the game, and when the cheerleaders tumble in their celebration, Angela falls on Pete, joking that she had mentioned she was ""falling"" for a guy in a chicken suit. He then kisses her, and the Brewster Roosters celebrate their only win of the year."

When questioned, he breaks down claiming the recent events as his fault, citing that 18 years ago when he was posted as the ACP in the Mumbai crime branch, his inability to take the required action led to the rise of Shoaib Khan ,who played a key role in these blasts. He then goes on to narrate the time in Bombay during the 1970s, when it was ruled by smuggler Sultan Mirza , his downfall and the consequent rise of Shoaib to power. After being hit by a flood in his hometown in Madras, Mirza arrives in Mumbai, where he starts working as a coal shoveler who smuggles gold items. Despite having a meager earning, he never fails to help the poor and needy and earns their support and respect. Gradually, he becomes the kingpin of smuggling world in Mumbai. He successfully divides the area among four gangsters peacefully, thus pinning the police in the deck and becoming the leader of Mumbai's underworld activities. Despite being a criminal, Mirza is shown to be a godfather-like figure to the people and a man of principles. He is against smuggling contraband as it is against his Muslim faith. Mirza has a crush on Bollywood actress Rehana  and eventually the two begin to date each other, and Sultan invests black money in her upcoming films. ACP Wilson moves to stop Rihana's films funded by Sultan. But he is tricked by Sultan and Rihana and gets framed for accepting bribe, damaging his credibility. Meanwhile Shoaib is a very ambitious person with a very dark and daring character right from his childhood. His father hussain khan, a sub-inspector in Bombay Police, tries very hard to control him unsuccessfully. He grows up to become a notorious gangster, being frequently involved in petty robberies. Worried, Shoaib's father turns to Sultan for help to which he agrees and helps him set up an electronics shop. But Shoaib is unsatisfied, as his only ambition now is to become rich and powerful like Mirza. Shoaib's girlfriend Mumtaz  works in a local jewellery shop, which Shoaib visits often and gives her stolen jewelry. One day when a customer recognizes her necklace on Mumtaz, she decides to confront him. This enrages Shoaib who beats up the owner of the necklace and destroys his shop. He goes to Sultan to be a part of his crime ring. Seeing his potential, Sultan agrees to take him under his wing. Shoaib learns the tricks of the trade and soon becomes Sultan's trusted aide. ACP Wilson considers Shoaib's ideas and dark ambitions for quick money and power in a potential conflict to Sultan's ideals and hence foresees Shoaib causing the eventual downfall of Sultan. He even refrains from killing Sultan and Shoaib at one point. Finally when Shoaib becomes invincible, he blames himself for the catastrophe. Meanwhile, Sultan decides to enter politics and goes to Delhi to meet the Home Minister of India, handing over his power to Shoaib. The money, unlimited power and Shoiab's unscrupulous ambitions lead him to carry out trades and acts which Sultan himself strongly condemns. He starts manufacturing illicit liquor, accepts contract killings, starts investing in drug peddling and runs extortion rackets. When Sultan returns to Bombay, he comes to know about Shoaib's misdeeds. He finds Shoaib in a party and slaps him publicly for his unethical activities. This infuriates Shoaib and he plots revenge. One day, as Sultan campaigns for his new party, Shoaib appears and assassinates Sultan Mirza whilst addressing the people on the dais, thus ending the saga of a smuggler who was loved by his people. Agnel, who was narrating the story, admits later that Shoaib has established an empire and operates from other countries as the kingpin of Mumbai. No government or force can reach or harm him.

Despite having a meager earning, he never fails to help the poor and needy and earns their support and respect. Gradually, he becomes the kingpin of smuggling world in Mumbai. He successfully divides the area among four gangsters peacefully, thus pinning the police in the deck and becoming the leader of Mumbai's underworld activities. Despite being a criminal, Mirza is shown to be a godfather-like figure to the people and a man of principles. He is against smuggling contraband as it is against his Muslim faith. Mirza has a crush on Bollywood actress Rehana  and eventually the two begin to date each other, and Sultan invests black money in her upcoming films. ACP Wilson moves to stop Rihana's films funded by Sultan. But he is tricked by Sultan and Rihana and gets framed for accepting bribe, damaging his credibility. Meanwhile Shoaib is a very ambitious person with a very dark and daring character right from his childhood. His father hussain khan, a sub-inspector in Bombay Police, tries very hard to control him unsuccessfully. He grows up to become a notorious gangster, being frequently involved in petty robberies. Worried, Shoaib's father turns to Sultan for help to which he agrees and helps him set up an electronics shop. But Shoaib is unsatisfied, as his only ambition now is to become rich and powerful like Mirza. Shoaib's girlfriend Mumtaz  works in a local jewellery shop, which Shoaib visits often and gives her stolen jewelry. One day when a customer recognizes her necklace on Mumtaz, she decides to confront him. This enrages Shoaib who beats up the owner of the necklace and destroys his shop. He goes to Sultan to be a part of his crime ring. Seeing his potential, Sultan agrees to take him under his wing. Shoaib learns the tricks of the trade and soon becomes Sultan's trusted aide. ACP Wilson considers Shoaib's ideas and dark ambitions for quick money and power in a potential conflict to Sultan's ideals and hence foresees Shoaib causing the eventual downfall of Sultan. He even refrains from killing Sultan and Shoaib at one point. Finally when Shoaib becomes invincible, he blames himself for the catastrophe. Meanwhile, Sultan decides to enter politics and goes to Delhi to meet the Home Minister of India, handing over his power to Shoaib. The money, unlimited power and Shoiab's unscrupulous ambitions lead him to carry out trades and acts which Sultan himself strongly condemns. He starts manufacturing illicit liquor, accepts contract killings, starts investing in drug peddling and runs extortion rackets. When Sultan returns to Bombay, he comes to know about Shoaib's misdeeds. He finds Shoaib in a party and slaps him publicly for his unethical activities. This infuriates Shoaib and he plots revenge. One day, as Sultan campaigns for his new party, Shoaib appears and assassinates Sultan Mirza whilst addressing the people on the dais, thus ending the saga of a smuggler who was loved by his people. Agnel, who was narrating the story, admits later that Shoaib has established an empire and operates from other countries as the kingpin of Mumbai. No government or force can reach or harm him.

When questioned, he breaks down claiming the recent events as his fault, citing that 18 years ago when he was posted as the ACP in the Mumbai crime branch, his inability to take the required action led to the rise of Shoaib Khan ,who played a key role in these blasts. He then goes on to narrate the time in Bombay during the 1970s, when it was ruled by smuggler Sultan Mirza , his downfall and the consequent rise of Shoaib to power. After being hit by a flood in his hometown in Madras, Mirza arrives in Mumbai, where he starts working as a coal shoveler who smuggles gold items. Despite having a meager earning, he never fails to help the poor and needy and earns their support and respect. Gradually, he becomes the kingpin of smuggling world in Mumbai. He successfully divides the area among four gangsters peacefully, thus pinning the police in the deck and becoming the leader of Mumbai's underworld activities. Despite being a criminal, Mirza is shown to be a godfather-like figure to the people and a man of principles. He is against smuggling contraband as it is against his Muslim faith. Mirza has a crush on Bollywood actress Rehana  and eventually the two begin to date each other, and Sultan invests black money in her upcoming films. ACP Wilson moves to stop Rihana's films funded by Sultan. But he is tricked by Sultan and Rihana and gets framed for accepting bribe, damaging his credibility. Meanwhile Shoaib is a very ambitious person with a very dark and daring character right from his childhood. His father hussain khan, a sub-inspector in Bombay Police, tries very hard to control him unsuccessfully. He grows up to become a notorious gangster, being frequently involved in petty robberies. Worried, Shoaib's father turns to Sultan for help to which he agrees and helps him set up an electronics shop. But Shoaib is unsatisfied, as his only ambition now is to become rich and powerful like Mirza. Shoaib's girlfriend Mumtaz  works in a local jewellery shop, which Shoaib visits often and gives her stolen jewelry. One day when a customer recognizes her necklace on Mumtaz, she decides to confront him. This enrages Shoaib who beats up the owner of the necklace and destroys his shop. He goes to Sultan to be a part of his crime ring. Seeing his potential, Sultan agrees to take him under his wing. Shoaib learns the tricks of the trade and soon becomes Sultan's trusted aide. ACP Wilson considers Shoaib's ideas and dark ambitions for quick money and power in a potential conflict to Sultan's ideals and hence foresees Shoaib causing the eventual downfall of Sultan. He even refrains from killing Sultan and Shoaib at one point. Finally when Shoaib becomes invincible, he blames himself for the catastrophe. Meanwhile, Sultan decides to enter politics and goes to Delhi to meet the Home Minister of India, handing over his power to Shoaib. The money, unlimited power and Shoiab's unscrupulous ambitions lead him to carry out trades and acts which Sultan himself strongly condemns. He starts manufacturing illicit liquor, accepts contract killings, starts investing in drug peddling and runs extortion rackets. When Sultan returns to Bombay, he comes to know about Shoaib's misdeeds. He finds Shoaib in a party and slaps him publicly for his unethical activities. This infuriates Shoaib and he plots revenge.

They fall in love and everything seems to be going fine till one day, while visiting her brother in Mumbai, Pooja's flight is hijacked by a group of terrorists, following the arrest of their leader Ashraf-ul-Haq Mallik. Ironically, this hijack has been engineered by Pooja's brother Vijay Varma , who is in league with the terrorist head Akhmash Jalal. Vijay is unaware of the fact that his beloved sister is on board the same flight. When he realises this, he is unable to do anything as Akhmash forbids him from doing anything that would jeopardise their mission. Karan daringly risks his life and rescues Pooja and the other passengers while ridding of all the hijackers on the plane, thus inviting the wrath of Akhmash and Vijay. Akhmash is now out to kill Karan. On the other hand, Vijay puts his foot down when Pooja reveals her intentions of marrying Karan. Pooja and Karan decide to escape, but they are chased and nabbed by Akhmash and his men and held captive in his den. Akhmash then tries to blackmail the Indian government by demanding the release of his leader Ashraf-ul-Haq Mallik as ransom for the lives of Karan and Pooja.The Indian government decides to release Ashraf-ul-Haq Mallik to rescue Karan.In the last scene there is a fight between Karan and the terrorists and all are killed including Ashraf-ul-Haq Mallik and Karan and Pooja are united. This was the most successful film of Karan to date, and was an above-average grosser that year and was highly popular among the masses. It also has arguably the most audacious helicopter stunt flying in Bollywood, done by Col Shaili Sharma, piloting a Bell 206L at knee-height in restricted rocky terrain near Hyderabad. This becomes the high point of the film towards the climax, along with the uplifting soulful qawwaali ""Allah Allah"" composed with zest by Nadeem Shravan"

Back in Forks, Edward Cullen  and Bella discuss the complications of becoming an immortal vampire. At 18 years old, one year older than the age Edward was when he became a vampire, Bella expresses her aversion to the idea of marrying so young, though Edward refuses to turn her until they are married and she's had various human experiences she would otherwise miss. While Charlie Swan ([[Billy Burke  investigates the disappearance of Riley Biers, Edward suspects his disappearance was caused by the newborn vampires. Furthering his suspicions is the intrusion of Riley into Bella's room. Although Edward fears for her safety, Bella insists that Jacob Black  and the rest of the werewolf pack would never harm her, but Edward is still not convinced. Bella goes to La Push to see Jacob, and returns home unharmed. During one of her visits, Jacob confesses that he is in love with Bella, and forcefully kisses her. Furious, she punches him and breaks her hand, and Edward later threatens Jacob and tells him to only kiss her if she asks him to. Bella even revokes the invitations of Jacob and his pack members to her graduation party, but when Jacob apologizes for his behavior, she forgives him. Meanwhile, Alice  sees a vision that the newborn army is attacking Forks led by Riley Biers. Jacob, accompanied by Quil  and Embry  overhear this, which leads to an alliance between the Cullens and Wolf pack. Later, the Cullens and the wolves agree to a meeting place and time to train and discuss strategy. During the training Jasper  explains to Bella that he was created by a vampire named Maria to control a newborn army. He hated his original existence and upon meeting Alice, joined the Cullens with her. Bella sees the true bond between a mated vampire pair and begins to understand Jasper better. Despite her reluctance to marry, Bella realizes that spending eternity with Edward is more important to her than anything else and agrees to marry him. Edward and Bella camp up in the mountains to hide Bella from the bloodthirsty newborns. During the night, Bella overhears a conversation between Edward and Jacob, in which they temporarily put aside their hatred towards each other. In the morning, Jacob overhears Edward and Bella discussing their engagement and becomes very upset. Before he can run off to get himself killed in the fight with the newborns, Bella desperately asks him to kiss her, and she realizes that she has fallen in love with him. Edward finds out about the kiss but is not angry, as Bella says she loves him more than Jacob. When Victoria finds Bella's hiding spot, Edward kills her while Seth kills Riley. The Cullens and the Quileute wolves, meanwhile, destroy her ""army"", though Jacob is injured saving Leah Clearwater from a newborn. Several members of the Volturi arrive to deal with the newborn army. They also see that the Cullens are guarding the newborn, Bree Tanner , who had refused to fight and surrendered to Carlisle. Jane  tortures Bree to get information, then instructs Felix to kill her, despite the Cullens' efforts to spare her. When Jane notes that Caius will find it interesting that Bella is still human, Bella informs her that the date for her transformation has been set. Bella visits the injured Jacob to tell him that even though she is in love with him, she has chosen to be with Edward. Saddened by her choice, Jacob reluctantly agrees to stop trying to come between her and Edward. Bella and Edward go to their meadow, where she tells him she has decided to do things his way: get married, make love, then be transformed into a vampire. She also explains that she never has been normal and never will be; she's felt out of place her entire life, but when she is in Edward's world she feels stronger and complete. At the end of the story they decide they need to tell Charlie about their engagement."

Seán meets his contact, a local man named Pol , in a dockside warehouse in the hope of being paid to smuggle cigarettes tax-free. Pol has no cigarettes, however, and instead offers Seán a large sum of money to smuggle a group of Chinese immigrants into the United Kingdom.

The nets come up near empty almost every time, however, and the conditions in the hold are beginning to deteriot rapidly. When one of the Chinese dies, Riley goes to the Skipper and confesses all. The Skipper confronts Seán but soon realises that he was simply doing what was in the ship's, and their, best interests. For the first time, the Skipper is forced to acknowledge that he's only making a loss by staying at sea. Broken, he gives the wheel to Seán, who turns for home. Meanwhile, the cook discovers Su Li and comforts her, but does not inform anyone else of her presence on board the ship. The Skipper believes that if they return to Scotland, they will face certain arrest; he will lose his license, and the bank will foreclose on the boat. He drowns the Chinese without telling anyone. Seán and Riley then see the nets are full and pull them up. The crew is horrified to find the corpses of the Chinese. The cook attacks the Skipper with a chain and kills him, as he would have no choice but to kill Su Li also. The film then ends with Riley and Su Li sitting at a bus stop in Peterhead, Scotland. Su Li gets on a coach and it drives away. Inside her bag is the large sum of money from the ship.

The film is largely set in ZEN, a bleak, economically deprived quarter on the northern outskirts of Palermo, Sicily, at the end of the 1980s. Its protagonist is Natale Sperandeo , a young man who has just been released from Malaspina, a juvenile detention centre. Unable to find legitimate work, he takes up with his former gang, consisting of unemployed youths like himself, and perpetrates an armed robbery. The film also traces the divergent paths taken by his former inmates at Malaspina, such as Mario ""Mery"" Libassi, the 17 year-old transvestite, who resumes his previous sordid career as a male prostitute while awaiting trial for the assault on a client; Claudio Catalano, while seeking to avoid the vindictive Carmelo Vella , obtains work as a mechanic in another neighbourhood, but shortly afterwards discovers his girlfriend, Vita is pregnant; Antonino Patané is forced to push drugs in order to maintain his two small children after the financial police sequester his potatoes which Antonino was selling without a license; and Giovanni Trapani, nicknamed King Kong and a member of Natale's gang, is fatally shot by a plainclothes police officer outside the open-air market of Vucciria after a long chase through the streets of Palermo for having robbed a car radio. Ragazzi Fuori accurately depicts the social problems faced by Natale and his companions, such as crime, poverty, unemployment, prostitution, teenage pregnancy, and police harassment, which were indelible features of life in the poorer districts of Palermo and other Sicilian cities during that time period. It is a drama with realistic scenes of sex, violence, police brutality, and rape. It ends with the discovery of the body of a young man, burnt beyond recognition, on a refuse tip. It is presumed to be that of Claudio, although the film never reveals its identity. The Italian language is spoken throughout the film mixed with the Sicilian dialect of Palermo."

One day, while Dee is working a shift at the local diner, the powerful local district attorney  leads a drug bust, sweeping Dee’s housing project. Police drag Dee from work in handcuffs, dumping her in the women’s county prison. Indicted based on the uncorroborated word of a single and dubious police informant facing his own drug charges, Dee soon discovers she has been charged as a drug dealer. Even though Dee has no prior drug record and no drugs were found on her in the raid or any subsequent searches, she is offered a hellish choice: plead guilty and go home as a convicted felon or remain in prison and fight the charges thus, jeopardizing her custody and risking a long prison sentence. Despite the urgings of her mother , and with her freedom and the custody of her children at stake, she chooses to fight the district attorney. Dee works with an ACLU attorney  and a former local narcotics officer  to take on the Texas justice system.Samuel Goldwyn Films - American Violet

John and Louisa's relationship is strained and she accuses him of never loving her mother, and ruining everything. While exploring the surrounding fields and forest they come across a large burial mound. Louisa is instantly attracted to it, whereas Sam is reluctant to go near it. On their first night in the house Louisa hears strange noises outside her bedroom window. She does not see the humanoid creature lurking close-by on the roof. The next day Sam finds a loaded shotgun hidden inside the piano in the living room, Sam begins to point it at Louisa and his father, later John buries it in the garden. In town, John learns that his house is locally famous for the disappearance of a woman who lived there. Later, he finds Louisa's pet cat torn apart near the house. Louisa returns to the mound after school and, while relaxing in the sunshine, hears strange noises and cuts away as we hear what sounds like something pouncing towards Louisa. That night John finds a trail of muddy footprints leading from the open front door to the bathroom. Louisa is inside with the door locked, sitting in the tub, washing mud from her body and hair. The muddy water draining away turns red with blood . Later that night, John finds Louisa sleepwalking in her room. When he takes her back to bed he finds a strange doll made from straw which Louisa knows nothing about, inside of which is a dark ball containing a live spider. The next morning Louisa comes down for breakfast wearing a short dress and make-up. When John asks her about the doll she claims not to have seen it before. When Louisa and Sam are at school Louisa is bullied by a preppy girl, and once she gets home she rips the head off her doll. John finds a pile of muddy clothes in her room, the head of Louisa's toy doll at the burial mound, and the bloody remains of a blackbird and a nest of spiders in the drawer where Lousia's straw doll was kept. Louisa is again confronted and bullied by the preppy girl, and she starts eyeing the stairs directly behind the girl. He's called in to pick Louisa up from school when she complains of stomach pain, and on the way in he sees the preppy girl whose arm is in a brace. Cassandra says that the girl said she ""fell down the stairs"". When Sam's teacher, Cassandra , gives John her phone number, Louisa becomes territorial. That night, John sees Louisa emerging from the woods after having forbidden her to return to the mound. She has a rash and what looks like bite marks on the skin around her neck, and at dinner she eats in an animal manner and as though starved. John finds an article about burial mounds on the internet and telephones an expert on the subject, Professor White , but is ignored. He then reads about the previous owner of the house, Sarah Wayne: she disappeared one day without a trace, after having locked her teenage daughter in her bedroom from the outside. The daughter was eventually found alive and went to live with her grandfather, Roger Wayne . John leaves the children with a babysitter and goes to see Roger Wayne and discovers that he burned down his house with his granddaughter inside. Roger tells John that she wasn't his granddaughter anymore. In the girl's room, John finds a strange nest made from twigs and straw and a depiction of the burial mound scrawled on her wall. While John is away, the babysitter is locked out of the house and killed by the creatures. Sam hides in his room as a mound-walker tries to get in. John arrives home, discovers Louisa, and asks what happened to the babysitter, but she says she does not know. After the police leave, Louisa vomits on the hallway floor. John takes her to bed and she tearfully asks him if he's going to leave her like her mother did. He tells her he never will. John dreams of a doorway on top of the burial mound and Louisa transforming into a creature. The next day he finds the same kind of nest in Louisa's room. He decides to take action, digs up the shotgun and hires a contractor to destroy the burial mound. Before the demolition takes place, Professor White arrives and pleads with John to wait. He tells him of an ancient civilization who worshiped the burial mounds, believing them to be the homes of ancient Gods, or ""mound-walkers"". He mentions a ritual involving the exchange of gifts, including small straw dolls, and the mound-walkers search for a young girl to mate with who could give birth to a new generation of deities and help them reclaim the earth. Horrified by this, John instructs the bulldozer to start its work. When it cuts into the mound, the body of the babysitter is discovered. John is taken to the police station for questioning while Cassandra the teacher looks after the kids. That night, when Officer Ed Lowry  drives John home, they are attacked and the officer is dragged out of the car screaming. John returns home to discover the house in disarray and finds Cassandra with her throat slit open. Before she dies she reaches for Louisa. Mound-walkers attack the house and John shoots and kills them. After the attack, Louisa is missing, and her screams can be heard coming from the mound. John takes Sam up to his room and tells him to wait for the police, before kissing him goodbye. He goes to the mound to rescue Louisa and finds a tunnel leading into it. He sets a can of gasoline and the explosives from the postponed demolition by the entrance and crawls inside. He finds himself in a deep network of tunnels. He finds Louisa in a pit, unconscious and covered in mud. When he carries her out the creatures start to howl and give chase. In the meantime, Sam comes out of the house, clutching a family portrait, and looks towards the mound. John and Louisa escape the mound and block the entrance with a leaking canister of ANFO , but there is another mound-walker waiting for them. Louisa collapses and begs her father not to leave her. John looks down at her and sees her beginning to transform into one of the creatures. John drops a flare into the leaking diesel fuel and the mound goes up in a huge explosion. After a while, in reflection on the family portrait that Sam is holding, we see a figure emerging slowly from the flames. Sam asks ""Daddy?"", although the figures identity is unclear. In the background several mound-walkers crawl down the walls of the house and the tree in the yard. Directly behind Sam a creature emerges from the side of the screen. Before it growls a sound is heard that may either be a gun loading or the creature moving. It is left to the viewer's interpretation if John and Sam live or die."

John finds a pile of muddy clothes in her room, the head of Louisa's toy doll at the burial mound, and the bloody remains of a blackbird and a nest of spiders in the drawer where Lousia's straw doll was kept. Louisa is again confronted and bullied by the preppy girl, and she starts eyeing the stairs directly behind the girl. He's called in to pick Louisa up from school when she complains of stomach pain, and on the way in he sees the preppy girl whose arm is in a brace. Cassandra says that the girl said she ""fell down the stairs"". When Sam's teacher, Cassandra , gives John her phone number, Louisa becomes territorial. That night, John sees Louisa emerging from the woods after having forbidden her to return to the mound. She has a rash and what looks like bite marks on the skin around her neck, and at dinner she eats in an animal manner and as though starved. John finds an article about burial mounds on the internet and telephones an expert on the subject, Professor White , but is ignored. He then reads about the previous owner of the house, Sarah Wayne: she disappeared one day without a trace, after having locked her teenage daughter in her bedroom from the outside. The daughter was eventually found alive and went to live with her grandfather, Roger Wayne . John leaves the children with a babysitter and goes to see Roger Wayne and discovers that he burned down his house with his granddaughter inside. Roger tells John that she wasn't his granddaughter anymore. In the girl's room, John finds a strange nest made from twigs and straw and a depiction of the burial mound scrawled on her wall. While John is away, the babysitter is locked out of the house and killed by the creatures. Sam hides in his room as a mound-walker tries to get in. John arrives home, discovers Louisa, and asks what happened to the babysitter, but she says she does not know. After the police leave, Louisa vomits on the hallway floor. John takes her to bed and she tearfully asks him if he's going to leave her like her mother did. He tells her he never will. John dreams of a doorway on top of the burial mound and Louisa transforming into a creature. The next day he finds the same kind of nest in Louisa's room. He decides to take action, digs up the shotgun and hires a contractor to destroy the burial mound. Before the demolition takes place, Professor White arrives and pleads with John to wait. He tells him of an ancient civilization who worshiped the burial mounds, believing them to be the homes of ancient Gods, or ""mound-walkers"". He mentions a ritual involving the exchange of gifts, including small straw dolls, and the mound-walkers search for a young girl to mate with who could give birth to a new generation of deities and help them reclaim the earth. Horrified by this, John instructs the bulldozer to start its work. When it cuts into the mound, the body of the babysitter is discovered. John is taken to the police station for questioning while Cassandra the teacher looks after the kids. That night, when Officer Ed Lowry  drives John home, they are attacked and the officer is dragged out of the car screaming. John returns home to discover the house in disarray and finds Cassandra with her throat slit open. Before she dies she reaches for Louisa. Mound-walkers attack the house and John shoots and kills them. After the attack, Louisa is missing, and her screams can be heard coming from the mound. John takes Sam up to his room and tells him to wait for the police, before kissing him goodbye. He goes to the mound to rescue Louisa and finds a tunnel leading into it. He sets a can of gasoline and the explosives from the postponed demolition by the entrance and crawls inside. He finds himself in a deep network of tunnels. He finds Louisa in a pit, unconscious and covered in mud. When he carries her out the creatures start to howl and give chase. In the meantime, Sam comes out of the house, clutching a family portrait, and looks towards the mound. John and Louisa escape the mound and block the entrance with a leaking canister of ANFO , but there is another mound-walker waiting for them. Louisa collapses and begs her father not to leave her. John looks down at her and sees her beginning to transform into one of the creatures. John drops a flare into the leaking diesel fuel and the mound goes up in a huge explosion. After a while, in reflection on the family portrait that Sam is holding, we see a figure emerging slowly from the flames. Sam asks ""Daddy?"", although the figures identity is unclear. In the background several mound-walkers crawl down the walls of the house and the tree in the yard. Directly behind Sam a creature emerges from the side of the screen. Before it growls a sound is heard that may either be a gun loading or the creature moving. It is left to the viewer's interpretation if John and Sam live or die."

Making sure not to be spotted by others, the protagonist spends six days inside the house, where he quietly and voyeuristically witnesses a series of bizarre events enacted by various living, antiquated objects  that dwell within the rooms of the house. On Monday, a box full of candies reveal themselves to be rusty nails and screws before placing themselves on the keys of a typewriter; On Tuesday, a cow tongue licks a drawer full of dishes clean before climbing into a meat grinder and being made into tiny scrolls; On Wednesday, a clockwork toy chicken breaks free of its tether and reaches a plate full of corn kernels only to be buried under a pile brown clay; On Thursday, a desk releases the pigeons that were trapped in its drawer only for them to be plucked by an unseen force, after which a chair tries to use the pigeons' feathers to fly only to crash and shatter on the floor. On Friday, a hose emerges from the buttonhole of a suit jacket and drinks all the water from a flower vase, causing the flowers in the vase to combust, and then urinates the water onto the floor; On Friday, a pair of dentures bind a cabinet full of pigs' feet with tough wire. On the seventh day, the man  is ready to complete the last part of his mission. He inserts sticks of dynamite into the very holes he drilled to peer into the rooms. He connects the explosives via a very long fuse to his alarm clock, modifying it into a time bomb. Just as the man is about to depart, he realizes he forgot to check off ""Sunday"" on his calendar, so he rushes back into the house to do so. With his mission accomplished, the man runs off into the distance, away from the doomed house."

The protagonist, Marco Terzi , is a teacher who has transferred to Palermo from Milan. He obtains a position as teacher inside the institution, and has great difficulty in establishing a rapport with the young, hostile students; in particular, Natale Sperandeo , the leader of the group, who is inside for murder, and Pietro Giancone . Terzi's situation is further complicated when Mario Libassi , a transvestite prostitute, nicknamed Mery, falls in love with him. With the passing of time, however, Terzi slowly gains the respect and admiration of his students, even from the most hardened of the young men. Mery per sempre was followed in 1990 with the sequel Ragazzi fuori, featuring most of the same cast and characters, with the exception of Placido and Amendola.

A war party of Indians, returning to their village; and two fur traders waiting to meet a different group of Indians with whom they trade. The war party attacks the other Indians, and kills their leader, who owns a magnificent white stallion. White Bull  attempts to capture the horse, but it is too quick, and makes off carrying the dead chief. Pike  and Henry  wait in vain for the traders, and are then attacked themselves by the war party. Henry is killed, the Indians take the trader's horses, and Pike is left alone with only a mule. Travelling alone, he comes across the ritual funeral of the dead chief. He saves the white stallion from ritual slaughter, abandons his mule, and continues his travels. The Medicine Man conducting the ritual was accidentally killed while Pike was taking the horse. The war party finds the stage coach, attacks it, kills the driver, guard, and one of the passengers, and then leaves White Bull to ransack the coach and passengers of all valuables. He gathers a hoard of jewels and other valuable items,takes a white servant girl for himself, and leaves the survivors standing in the desert. One of the survivors,a priest, takes a coach horse and rides off to alert the hacienda. The story then becomes a four-way chase.

Even though the good  may win in the end, is it worth the wait? The tortoise &mdash; Rajaram P. Joshi  &mdash; is a middle-class clerk living in a chawl  in Bombay. He is secretly in love with his neighbor, Sandhya Sabnis  but is unable to disclose his love for her, mainly due to his timidity. Rajaram is a very goodnatured and hardworking man. Most of his neighbors and colleagues take advantage of his goodness. One day Rajaram's fast-tallking friend Bashudev  &mdash; the hare &mdash; comes for a visit and makes himself at home. Bashudev generally impresses people by his false success stories and his over-the-top attitude. Bashudev starts wooing Sandhya, and she falls in love with him. He then joins Rajaram's company, Footprint Shoes, by impressing the owner, Mr. Dhindhoria, with false stories about his work experience and love of golf. He also starts flirting with Dhindhoria's beautiful wife Anuradha  and daughter Jojo  at the same time. In the chawl, the Sabnis family decides to get Sandhya married to Bashudev, much to the misery of Rajaram. But on the day of the engagement, Bashudev disappears after being caught red-handed, romancing Anuradha, by Jojo. The engagement is called off. Rajaram then offers to marry the devastated Sandhya, but she tells him that she has been very intimate with Bashudev and is perhaps pregnant. Rajaram shows his greatness by accepting her in spite of all this and expressing his long hidden love towards her. According to vile parle based film expert Rajesh Subramanian Sai Paranjpye was very annoyed with producer Basu Bhattacharya when the release of Sparsh got delayed. 3 years later when Sai Paranjpye made Katha, she purposely named Farooque Shaikh's character, which had negative shades, Basu Bhatt.

It is then suggested that these organizations were infiltrated by the CIA, eventually leading to the division of the then more unified African-American community, and again leading to the establishment of new violent street gangs. After this interviews with several current and former members, and relatives, of the Los Angeles street gangs the Crips and Bloods are shown, with changing contexts. This ranges from being about why the interviewed are involved in gang activity, to the problems and trouble with the gangs and eventually to if and how the problems can be solved. A part of the film does for example follow a number of mothers of sons who has been murdered by gang violence talking about their experiences and views.

The team leader, Wally Hamer briefs the men to be ready. After being inserted, the team finds a local guide, Abdul , in a village in Southern Afghanistan, where the cleric is from. Together, they go to the mountains, where the cleric has a reputation for hiding. As they go further into the mountains, they begin to have strange encounters. First, they are ambushed by gunmen, who kill Trinoski. The team returns fire, killing multiple gunmen, but when the check the bodies, they have disappeared. That night, the team spots headlights of a vehicle approaching. However, the two lights separate and then speedily fly into the sky and disappear. After speculating on what the lights may have been, they radio for a helicopter to resupply them. The next day, they cannot get reception on their radio or GPS. Their truck, damaged from the ambush, is struggling to move up the mountain. At night, the team hears a helicopter approaching, though they cannot spot it. As their radio is not working, they attempt to signal the helicopter. As the helicopter, still unseen, sounds to be directly on top of them, the noise abruptly and instantaneously stops, something that shouldn't be physically possible. Meanwhile, the radio picks up what sounds like Farci or Arabic, but no one can understand it. They cache Trinoski's body so that they can move to a safer position for the night. The next morning, the team finds parts of Trinoski's body strewn out across rocks. Further up the mountain, they spot strange, triangular markers made of sticks across the mountain's surface. As they continue on foot with their mission in the rocky and barren landscape, fatigue, frustration and confusion take their toll on the members of the team and they come across a cave. Inside, they find an old man who gives them shelter and refills their canteens. Sergeant Sadler notices that under the man's robes, he appears to be wearing a nineteenth century British army uniform. Sadler tells the others of a legend of how a British regiment disappeared in Afghanistan's mountains, leaving only one survivor. In the morning Sergeant Cole observes the old man apparently talking to himself. But when he looks through his night vision goggles, the soldier sees a a group of men with swords in black robes. Panicking, the soldier opens fire, accidentally killing the old man. Abdul says they must bury the body, but Keynes orders the team to move on in case the enemy heard them. One soldier, the medic, develops horrible stomach pains. As he tries tries to drink from a canteen, he finds that it is full of sand, as are everyone else's water containers. Further on, Abdul is surprised to find that there is an entire valley that did not used to be there. The tensions further increase when the team is encountered by a bright light at night. As K.T. and Cole try to flank the light, believing it to be a ruse by the Taliban, they're immediately vaporized. The next morning, Abdul warns Keynes that they are dealing with a supernatural phenomenon that is beyond human conception, and has deadly consequences; he then commits suicide by stepping off a cliff. As the team progresses further and tensions among the men increase, the soldiers confront Keynes and demand the truth. Keynes shows them a recording from his thermal imaging camera and informs them about the real motive. The thermal video shows a triangular object in the desert. Being nearly invisible to the naked eye, it lifts off the ground after three  men, including Muhammad-Aban, walk to it and vanishes right in front of Keynes' eyes. It was this object that killed the men. The CIA monitored this phenomenon for some time and sent Keynes and the special forces team there to further investigate it. The whole time, Keynes has been recording with his special thermal camera and sending the images to Langley via an advanced laser aimed at CIA satellites. Keynes theorizes that this object originates from an ancient Indian mythology called 'Vimanas', a sort of UFO-related phenomena that occurred when Alexander rode through this area of land as he was conquering, and the bright lights and the ghostly gunmen are associated with it. He also explains that the team is an 'expendable' for the investigation and they will not be rescued, which causes a brief scuffle with the agitated sergeant. Running out of ammo, water and food the team wanders further into the desert where they finally encounter the vimanas at what appears to be the location that the British regiment was destroyed. Sadler, overwhelmed with fear, opens fire upon the seemingly invisible vimanas only to be vaporized. Keynes flees with Degetau and abandons him later, as is too sick to continue, and later hears his screams before being obliterated by the objects. Exhausted and traumatized, Keynes searches for water. He encounters an oasis and drinks water from it only to discover the body of a fellow soldier laying next to the water. Unable to grasp the horror, he passes out. When he wakes up in the night, he hears the distant sound of a helicopter and fires his flare gun. Simultaneously, several flares fire up from the valley. The bright light he encountered earlier re-appears and two beings from it approach him. As it touches his forehead, he sees visions and hallucinations of various objects and landscapes from his previous encounters, causing him to go into a trance. In the final scene he is shown floating several inches above a bed with a talisman he took from Aban's home in his hand, inside a hospital room, where doctors and a military colonel are observing him through a glass window. In a trance, he finally whispers, ""They will save us all..."" In the final credits, interviews of Keynes' wife are shown in which she says that the family has not yet been informed about him and concludes him to be missing. This film heavily references Djinn myhtos."

His predecessor on the project and Lang's long-term aide, Mike McAra, died in an apparent accident. The writer travels to the fictional Massachusetts village of Old Haven on Martha's Vineyard, where Lang is staying with his wife, Ruth , and a staff of servants and security personnel. The writer is checked into a small hotel. Lang's personal assistant , Amelia Bly , forbids him to take McAra's manuscript outside, emphasizing that it is a security risk. Shortly after the writer's arrival, Lang is accused by former Foreign Secretary Richard Rycart  of authorising the illegal seizure of suspected terrorists and handing them over for torture by the CIA, a possible war crime. Lang faces prosecution by the International Criminal Court unless he stays in the U.S. or any other country that does not recognise the court's jurisdiction. As reporters and protesters swarm the island, the writer is moved into McAra's old room at Lang's house, where personal belongings have not been cleared out yet. Lang travels to Washington while the writer clears the room, finding an envelope containing clues suggesting McAra may have stumbled on a dark secret. Among the material is a handwritten phone number. During a bicycle ride around the island, the writer encounters an old man  who tells him that the current couldn't have taken McAra's body from the ferry where he disappeared to the beach where it was discovered. He reveals that a neighbour saw flashlights on the beach the night the body was discovered, but later fell off a ladder and went into a coma. The writer is later intercepted by Ruth and her security guard, who take him back to the estate. There, Ruth admits that Lang has never been very political, and until recently had always taken her advice. When the writer tells her the old man's story, she suddenly rushes out into the rainy night to ""clear her head."" Upon returning, she confides in the writer that Lang and McAra had argued the night before he died. She and the writer end up sleeping together. The next morning, the writer decides he is getting too intimate with his subject and moves back to the hotel. After finding some photos of Lang's college days, driving McAra's car, he uses pre-programmed directions on the vehicle's GPS that lead him to Belmont, at the estate of Professor Paul Emmett . Emmett denies anything more than a cursory acquaintance with Lang, despite the writer showing him two photographs of the two of them, as well as another one on the wall of his study. When the writer tells Emmett that the GPS directions to Emmett's house were programmed the night McAra died and that his predecessor visited him, Emmett denies any knowledge and becomes evasive. The writer leaves Emmett's estate, and he is followed by a car, but manages to elude it. The writer boards the ferry, but when he sees the car that had followed him drive aboard, with two men looking for him, he flees the boat at the last moment and checks into a small motel by the ferry dock. Not knowing who to turn to, the writer dials the handwritten phone number, only to discover it belongs to Rycart, who inquires about his whereabouts and indicates he'll pick him up. While waiting for Rycart, the writer does a Google search on Emmett and finds that, in addition to being a Pulitzer Prize-winning professor, he is linked with a military contractor through his think tank. He also finds leads that connect Emmett to the CIA as far back as the 1970s, when the agency recruited academics for the creation of propaganda material to be used abroad. When Rycart arrives, he tells the writer that McAra supplied him with documents linking Lang to torture flights. He also reveals that McAra had found something new before he died, confiding to Rycart that in case anything happened, the clues would be in the ""beginning"" of the book. The men cannot, however, find anything in the manuscript's early pages. The writer the reveals all of the information he found about Emmet, theorizing that he recruited Lang, to which Rycart agrees, saying that, for all his tenure as Prime Minister, all of Lang's decisions were aimed at helping the U.S. When the writer is summoned to accompany Lang on the return flight, he confronts Lang and accuses him of being a CIA agent recruited by Emmett and tells him that McAra was outing him out with Rycart. Lang derides his suggestions. Upon alighting the aircraft, Lang is assassinated by a British anti-war protestor, who is in turn shot by Lang's bodyguards. The writer is questioned by U.S. authorities as a prime witness, his passport withheld, though later recovered by his publicist. Despite Lang's death, the writer is asked to complete the book for posthumous publication, as in light of the recent events, it will be a best-seller. During the book's launch party in London, Amelia unwittingly tells the writer that the Americans tightened access to the book, as the ""beginnings"" contained evidence that threatened national security. She also tells him that Emmett was Ruth's tutor when she was a Fulbright scholar in Harvard. The writer realises that the clues were hidden in the original manuscript at the beginning of each chapter, and discovers the message, ""Lang's wife Ruth was recruited as a CIA agent by Professor Paul Emmett of Harvard University."" Ruth shaped Lang's every political decision to benefit the United States, under direction from the CIA. The writer passes a note to Ruth telling of his discovery.

However, the battery has a flaw: the color yellow, the one part of the light spectrum that can resist green. The most concentrated source of yellow energy, the yellow element, was hidden by the Guardians to prevent others from using it against them. Ferris Aircraft's test pilot Hal Jordan  is recruited to join the Green Lantern Corps after the death of Abin Sur. He is placed under the supervision of respected senior officer Sinestro , who is investigating Abin's murder. Abin was killed while doing an undercover investigation of Kanjar Ro , who managed to locate and steal the yellow element. What no one realizes is that Sinestro provided Kanjar with the location of the element, in order to have it fashioned into a weapon of comparable power to the Green Lantern battery. Jordan quickly comes to understand that Sinestro's beliefs are not in line with those of the Guardians: Sinestro believes that the Guardians have reduced the Corps to merely picking up the messes criminals create as opposed to proactively dealing with the problem. During a mission to capture Kanjar Ro, Jordan is knocked unconscious by Kanjar's energy staff. Sinestro comes in and kills Kanjar, pinning the blame on Jordan. Jordan is stripped of his ring as punishment. While Jordan waits to be taken home, Sinestro uses his ring to temporarily animate Kanjar's corpse allowing him to learn the location of Qward, where the yellow element weapon is being fashioned. Jordan convinces fellow Lanterns Boodikka  and Kilowog  that Sinestro is not what he seems. They catch Sinestro red-handed, but Boodikka turns out to be in league with Sinestro and attacks Jordan and Kilowog. Sinestro escapes, and Boodikka is killed when Jordan tricks her into destroying Kanjar's unstable energy staff. On Qward, the Weaponers bestow Sinestro with the yellow ring and battery, the latter of which resembles Ranx the Sentient City. Using its power, he lays waste to Oa, the yellow light easily overcoming the Green Lantern rings. The yellow battery destroys the green battery, rendering all the Green Lantern Corps' power rings inert and causing death by asphyxiation of countless Green Lanterns who were in space at the time when their rings failed. Jordan, having recovered his ring moments too late, pounds on the inert green element, breaking it and absorbing the whole of its power. Imbued with the full might of the green energy, he destroys the yellow battery by smashing it between two moons. However, having exhausted most of his power to destroy the yellow battery, Jordan is left weakened against Sinestro. After a pitched battle, Jordan uses the last of his power to knock Sinestro to the surface of Oa, where Kilowog crushes the yellow ring  with his foot. Kilowog, his ring having regained some of its power, then saves Jordan. Once Oa is rebuilt and the Green Lantern battery restored, Jordan is asked by the Guardians to lead the Corps in reciting the Green Lantern oath. Jordan then leaves for Earth to check in with his other boss, Carol Ferris , remarking on the long ""commute""."

32428439A family is holding a birthday for their daughter during the apocalypse, maintaining the illusion things are still normal despite their only light source being a camcorder and birthday candles. It is clear, however, that they have barely been surviving as zombies overwhelm them. The footage of the ""birthday"" is archived by a military photographer, Jones, who documents his teams efforts of surviving the zombie onslaught in a remote beachside compound. There, they take in survivors, both infected and not, including the sole survivor of the last movies original film crew, Leanne . Together, along with a medical officer, the team attempts to hold out as long as possible. Things take a turn for the worse, as zombies break in and overrun the facility. Only Leanne, Jones, and a hand full of soldiers make it out alive, forced to leave behind one of their own. The survivors find their way to a remote cabin where they attempt to hold up for the night as it begins snowing. However, the zombie population has grown too much for anywhere to be safe and they are once more forced to flee. With their transportation incapacitated, they make a dangerous trek through the brutal outdoors at night. The next day, the survivors continue to seek any kind of sanctuary. While walking in the woods, they discover booby-traps and the macabre remains of dispatched zombies. Figuring it to be human bandits, they carefully avoid numerous traps, until they come across the enemy hideout. It is here they discover the true enemies of the living, a bastion of psychopathic renegades led by the notorious Goke . Hardened by the elements, Goke is once again aided by his sidekick Manny and several other humans, that he leads with no discrimination. Two of the soldiers, Jones and Carter, secretly witness Goke's men sexually assault an infected female, until the leader steps out and shoots her in the head before chastising them. Jones and Carter return to the others to inform them of the situation before falling back into the woods. Leanne, at this point, had yet to see her past tormentors, however she recognises the grim location she had been found prior to the movies opening. Throughout the day, the soldiers and Leanne use hand to hand tactics against the undead to keep the bandits from knowing their location. They continue this until night as they camp, each survivor divulging their personal lives as it is now clear that there is indeed hope... a ship preparing to leave. Their discussion is cut short as they hear the sounds of someone nearby, discovering that the bandits are in fact searching for them. Tragedy strikes as Leanne is discovered and reunited with Goke and Manny. Uninterested in raping her again, Goke promises that she will have a special fate. The soldiers, in hiding, strike against the gang and rescue Leanne. In the shootout, zombies overwhelm both sides as Carter is unfortunately shot and subsequently devoured. As Leanne and the soldiers are once again forced into the night, they find themselves in a cemetery while the bandits dispatch the living dead. As another dawn once again gives the survivors light, they are unfortunately captured after a devastating shootout leaving the last female soldiers, Kayne , injured. Fate is once again cruel to Leanne, as she and her fellow captives are once again in the same barn the military rescued her from. Goke, Manny and his crew subdue and tie up the survivors, keeping Kayne separated as well as taking control of Jones' camera. Goke sets his evil sights on torturing them, having a mentally impaired follower named Billy beat the teams leader. Leanne even goes as far as to call Goke by his name, begging him to stop. He does not, allowing Billy to violently assault the leader. Goke and Billy enter the next room to find Manny torturing the injured Kayne. they then prepare Billy for ""initiation"", by raping her. Hesitant throughout, Billy is physically forced to sexually assault and stab the woman to death. Before Goke can rape her dead body, gunshots are heard in the next room. The three reenter the holding room of the barn to find that all the survivors are still tied up and one of his men shot dead, a victim of Nicholson, the soldier left behind in the beginning of the movie who had been following behind his comrades all along. Another psycho, Curtis, has his throat slit and Manny is shot. Goke manages to flee outside and after a short shootout, escapes. Having been freed by Nicholson, Leanne oversees an injured Manny who taunts her before meeting a bloody end at the young woman's shotgun. After the burial and mourning for Kayne, the soldiers leader, Maddox, is interrogated by the others who discover the truth of the UK's fate. A large scale firebombing has been ordered for the next morning. With his hopes set on the boats, Maddox leads Jones, Leanne and Nicholson to a nearby bunker where the last known military holdout was known to be. The soldiers of the bunker are all dead, leaving the survivors in a state of panic. Maddox, close to losing all hope, runs out to find where the soldiers had left markers for the boats which never came. Insistent on waiting, despite the sounds of the jets overhead, he remains behind as the others engage in combat against an army of zombies. While Jonesy, Nicholson and Leeann are still in the bunker, zombies come in surrounding them. Nicholson orders them to fight but Jonesy is too scared and can only watch. Nicholson is killed and Jonesy instead watches Leeann fight them herself but she tires out and falls and is killed as well. Jonesy then states his failure to the camera and commits suicide via pistol when a zombie grabs him. Footage throughout the film, show soldiers in hazmat gear gathering survivors and killing them to prevent further infection reveal them to be Jones, Maddox, Carter and Kayne, facing the psychological damage of slaughtering possible innocents and burning their remains during a time when the infection wasn't clear.

10556722The film is set in the futuristic Metro City, a metropolis which floats in the sky above the polluted ""Surface"". Metro City's population is aided by a multitude of different robots who are dumped on the Surface when broken or disused. Toby, son of Dr. Tenma, learns that his father is going to show President Stone, the militaristic leader of the city, the Peacekeeper, a new guardian robot that he's been working on. Doctor Elefun, one of Tenma's colleagues, introduces Stone to the Blue and Red Cores, two energy spheres mined from a star fragment, that produce energy which can power robots via positive and negative energy, respectively. Stone places the Red Core in the Peacekeeper, causing it to go out of control. The Peacekeeper tries to attack the humans, but Tenma puts a barrier between them. Meanwhile, Toby has been released early from school, and rewires Orrin, his family's robot, in order to attend the Ministry of Science's demonstration of the Peacekeeper. Seeking to have a closer look at the Peacekeeper, Toby enters the same room as the robot, only for the Peacekeeper's first attempt to destroy the barrier to backfire with the result that Toby is totally annihilated. After the Peacekeeper is stopped by security forces, Dr. Tenma, wracked with despair, builds an identical robotic clone of Toby, using DNA from a strand of his hair to obtain his memories, which will make the robot think he is Toby. He also powers the robot with the positive blue core. The robot quickly comes to life, and Tenma brings him home. Tenma quickly realizes that while the robot possesses Toby's memories, it is not exactly like his original son, as the robot's higher mental and physical powers frequently remind him. Tenma had initially included the robot's powers in order to prevent his ""son"" from being destroyed again. Unaware that he is a robot, Toby tries to figure out why he can understand the language of some robot cleaners and discovers he can fly via rocket-boosters hidden in his shoes. He discovers various other abilities and heads home to tell his father, only to find that Tenma and Elefun are discussing deactivating him. Tenma reveals to Toby that he is a robot. President Stone's men detect the Blue Core's energy signature and pursue Toby. Stone calls in the Spirit of Freedom: a massive, heavily-armed, flying battleship. Rendered unconscious, Toby falls off the floating city and lands in the junkyard below. He meets several children including Cora, a girl who left Metro City after her parents neglected her, and a robotic dog named Trashcan. Toby meets the Robot Revolution Front: Sparx, Robotsky and Mike the Fridge, who easily identify Toby as a robot and rename him ""Astro"". Astro goes along with his new name and lives with the children and their fatherly figure, Hamegg, who appears to care for broken robots, but secretly treats robots just as callously as Stone, and also runs the Robot Games: destructive gladiatorial matches in which robots are forced to fight to the death. Astro and his friends find an offline construction robot named ZOG, and Astro secretly revives ZOG. The kids bring him back and clean him up for the Hamegg games. Later that night, Astro comes across Cora trying to call Metrocity. She reveals to him that she actually has parents and was worried if they even missed her. Astro promises not to tell and tries to tell her his secret but can't. The next day at the Hamegg games, Hamegg betrays Astro, learning of him being a robot, and pits Astro against other robots in the Robot Games. Unable to simply leave, Astro reluctantly destroys all the robots. Hamegg releases ZOG for Astro to fight, but both refuse to fight one another. Stone and his men arrive then and arrest Astro. They take him back to the Ministry of Science, where Tenma is asked to remove the Blue Core; however, at the last moment, he has a change of heart, accepting that even if Astro is not Toby, he is still his son, and allows Astro to escape. Stone places the Red Core into the Peacekeeper again, only for it to absorb him and take on his consciousness. Astro and Stone fight across the city, demolishing most of the buildings and causing the city to begin crashing to Earth. Astro is able to slow Metro City's decent by flying underneath and pushing upwards with his leg-rockets. Cora, the other children, and the Robot Revolution try to help to bring down the Peacekeeper/Stone fusion. Stone catches Astro and is about to absorb him, but when the Blue and Red Cores clash, he lets Astro out due to the close proximity of the two Cores causing him great pain. Astro lands in a building, where he reunites with Tenma. Tenma tells him that if the Blue Core and Red Core come together, Astro and the Peacekeeper will both die. Astro decides that this was the reason he was made, and flies straight toward Stone, crashing into him and merging the Cores which destroys the Peacekeeper and frees Stone . However, with both Cores drained of energy, Astro is deactivated. Cora, Dr. Elefun and others find Astro's body. ZOG transfers some of his Blue Core energy  to Astro; with the catalyst restarted, the Blue Core once more becomes a limitless source of energy, so Astro is easily revived and his wounds automatically heal. Astro is reunited with Dr. Tenma, and Cora finds and makes up with her parents. Stone awakes, only to be arrested by his own troops. When an alien life-form appears over the city, the movie ends with Astro flying up to battle it.

While on route to their destination, the jeep breaks down and they abandon the jeep. Despite protestations, they commandeer the refugees' wheelbarrow, and set off cross-country on foot. The refugees get the vehicle started and make use of it themselves. Meanwhile, the Italian troops who are treated as inferiors by their German counterparts, are given rations. The fact that they are allotted half rations causes a riot. The Germans also wish the Italians to take on the lesser task of confronting the partisans, rather than take on the Americans directly for their own gain. When the two Italian parties meet they are reluctant to fight, the partisans coerce some men to swap sides. When the Italian troops run into the pseudo-partisans, some of them become Communist sympathizers to avoid death. Their leader is shot and his two henchmen are recruited into the army. The Americans take shelter in a farm overnight. A majority of them are of Italian descent, including one socially accepted combat-soldier who accompanies them. An alleged Scottish resident sheltering with them is actually a German spy and radios their position to the German army officer who is constantly having trouble with cut communication cables. The Italian troops bravely resist in a confrontation with the quartermaster group, yet are later faced with a tank, killing a lead member of their group. The quartermasters reach the front line until they are requested to help with the battle by engaging the Germans directly. The Germans have the disadvantage of not directly engaging with the partisans because communication cable lines are constantly cut. The Germans are ordered to retreat except for the commanding officer himself, one sergeant and an earlier soldier who has lost his leg in the course of combat. The volunteers stay behind knowing that they will certainly die. The main opposing officer and unnamed soldier take position in a machine gun nest for their last stand.

Glen quickly turns the truck around and backs Willy into the water, flooding his truck in the process. Willy is finally released into the water, but Dial and his goons attempt to stop them. During the struggle, Jesse gets Willy to swim away, but panics when he sees that Dial has the whaling company to back him up when their boats show up in the water. They release nets and Jesse has one last chance to get Willy away before he becomes trapped. He runs towards a wall of rocks, calling for Willy to follow him, which steers him away from the boats. Jesse goes to the edge of the rocks where Willy swims up to him and tells Willy that if he makes the jump , he'll be free.

He goes back to Glen and Annie who hug him as they look out into the sea. Willy calls out to Jesse in the distance and both say their final farewell.

She considers her jijaji to be highly intellectual and looks upon him as her idol. Parimal develops an inferiority complex thanks to Sulekha's excessive praise of her jijaji and decides to prove that he is in no way a lesser mortal. Jijaji, meanwhile, has written a letter to Haripad bhaiyya  asking him to send a driver who can speak good Hindi because his present driver James D'costa  uses improper grammar. This provides the perfect opportunity for Parimal to get to see and interact with jijaji. Parimal becomes Pyaremohan Ilahabadi, a motor-mouth driver who pretends to hate the English language and so speaks only Hindi. So begins the comedy of errors, as Parimal and Sulekha play prank after prank on the unsuspecting jijaji.

Pyaremohan's excessively refined Hindi, his habit of correcting jijaji's usage of the language and his persistence in getting jijaji to teach him English all serve to irk jijaji to no end and provide for many laughs. Parimal's long-time friend P K Srivastava  is also party to the prank. His sister-in-law Vasudha  suspects fake 'Parimal' - Sukumar Sinha - of infidelity to his wife 'Sulekha' when he tries to get close to her.

Thus jijaji comes to comprehend the whole enactment, finally admitting that he was truly fooled. The film revolves around the resolution of these funny mishaps.
31439778 A gang of heavily armed men scour and finally narrow down on a house in Wasseypur. They surround the house and unleash a wave of bullets and grenades on it with the intention of killing the family inside it. After heavy firing on the house, they retreat away from the crime scene in a vehicle, convinced they have killed everyone within. The leader of the gang then calls one JP Singh  on his cell phone and reports that the family have been successfully executed but he is double crossed by JP Singh as a fire fight erupts between them and a police check post blocking their escape route. The scene cuts abruptly for a prologue by the narrator, Nasir.  The narration describes the history and nature of Wasseypur. The village has been historically ruled by the Qureshi Muslims, a sub-caste of animal butchers who are feared by the non-Qureshi Muslims in Wasseypur and Dhanbad by extension. During the British Raj, the British seized the farm lands of Dhanbad for coal which began the business of coal mining in Dhanbad. The region was a hotbed of the local faceless dacoit Sultana Qureshi who robbed British trains in the night and thus holds some patriotic value for the locals.  Shahid Khan , a Pathan, takes advantage of the mysteriousness of the faceless dacoit Sultana, a Qureshi, by impersonating his identity to rob British ferry trains. The Qureshi clans eventually find out and order the banishment of Shahid Khan and his family from Wasseypur. They settle down in Dhanbad where Shahid begins work as a labourer in a coal mine. He is unable to be at his wife's side who dies during childbirth. The enraged Shahid kills the coal-mines muscleman who had denied him leave on that day. In 1947, Independent India begins to assert its authority over itself. The British coal mines are sold to Indian industrialists and Ramadhir Singh  receives a few coal-mines in the Dhanbad region. He hires Shahid as the new muscle-man of the coal mine who terrorizes the local population to seize their lands and extract compliance. On a rainy day, Ramadhir Singh overhears Shahid's ambitions of taking over the coal mines from him. Singh tricks Shahid to travel to Varanasi for business but instead, he is murdered. Nasir finds Ramadhir's umbrella with his initials near the door, concluding that Ramadhir eavesdropped on their conversation. He flees from the place with Shahid's son Sardar in the nick of time as Ehsaan Qureshi , another associate of Ramaadhir Singh shows up too late for killing them. An unsuccessful Ehsaan lies to Singh that Shahid's family has been murdered and buried. Sardar grows along with his cousin Asghar  and learns the truth about his fathers death upon which he shaves his head vowing not to grow it until Ramadhir singh is dead.  Ramadhir Singh establishes himself in the coal mining by misusing his position and power as a trade union leader by turning it into a mafia organisation threatening labourers into giving a substantial portion of their income to Ramaadhir's henchmen. Singh encourages the labourers to dip the coal ores into water to fake production output.  The coal mines are nationalised. A mature Sardar Khan  and his kins start hijacking Ramaadhir's coal trucks mid transit but Ramadhir Singh suspects the foul play on SP Sinha, a Coal India official and murders him.

They misuse their employment by secretly selling the company petrol in the black market. Later, they rob a petrol pump and a train bogey belonging to the Singh family. They usurp Singh's land leading which forces the two families to confront each other for talks.

During Muharram, both Shias and Sunnis are out mourning including the Qureshi clan. Sardar uses the opportunity to launch a major bomb attack on many Qureshi shops and houses.

Late night, while Faizal is still asleep, his friend who turns out to be a spy calls up the Qureshis and passes this bit of information to them. Sardar leaves home alone and reaches the Durga household to give them their expense allowance. Durga turns out to be yet another Qureshi spy. The Qureshi men follow Sardars car and when the latter stops at a petrol pump to refuel they start shooting while Sardar ducks in the car for cover.

2997971The story concerns Devon Miles , a teen who has just graduated from high school in New York City. Upon graduating, Devon heads to Atlanta, Georgia to attend the fictitious Atlanta A&T University, a historically black college that takes enormous pride in its marching band. Devon was personally invited to attend on full scholarship by Dr. Lee , head of the band, for his prodigious talents. The A&T band separates itself from its competitors by requiring all members to read music, by focusing on various styles of music rather than what music is currently popular on the radio, and by dedication to the teamwork emphasized ""one band, one sound"" concept. The band has a preseason that is similar to an athletic team's induction in that it is very physically and mentally difficult. It challenges all recruits to push themselves past what they previously thought were their limits. At the end of preseason, the musicians audition for spots on the field, and Devon is the only freshman to make P1, the highest level player. While going through his rigorous process, Devon also finds time to romance an upperclassman dancer, Laila . College life starts well for Devon, as he has the girl and a spot on the field. Things begin to sour when Sean , Devon's percussion leader, begins to grow weary of Devon's cocky attitude. Sean later challenges Devon to take a solo in his first game, believing the freshman will panic and be embarrassed in front of everyone. Sean is shocked when Devon takes the solo and is subsequently humiliated. This sets up some tension in the drumline which is exacerbated when Dr. Lee is told by President Wagner , the school's president, to change his focus from music to entertainment or lose his funding. Lee does not want to give Devon more playing time because he feels Devon's attitude and respect are lacking. The situation further deteriorates when it is revealed that Devon cannot read music. Devon is demoted to P4 by Dr. Lee until he learns, then later put back on P1 when Wagner pressures Dr. Lee to do so. However, after inflaming a melee with a visiting band at A&T's homecoming game after Devon plays on an opposing band member's drum, Devon is finally kicked out of the band by Dr. Lee. The fight also harms his relationship with Laila as she is embarrassed to introduce him to her parents, who attended the game and thought of Devon as a hoodlum. Devon contacts A&T's rival school Morris Brown College, to discuss playing for their band next season. Mr. Wade , Brown's band leader, says that Devon does not need to know how to read music and will likely get a full scholarship and a good position on the drumline. When Wade wants to know what Dr. Lee is planning for the BET Big Southern Classic , Devon realizes that his heart and honor are still with the A&T band. He rejects the scholarship offer from the rival band and returns to A&T. Though Devon is still not playing for the band, he cannot give up his drumming. He is sent cassette tapes from his estranged father and gets some ideas for new drum arrangements. He and Sean have a final confrontation that clears the air and they begin to work together. The two present their idea for an entrance cadence to Dr. Lee who decides they will be used during the Classic. Devon helps the drumline prepare and patches up his relationship with Laila. Lee also tells Devon that he can guarantee him a full return to the band next year. At the Classic, the bands are shown performing a mixture of popular songs. Morris Brown's band even gets rapper Petey Pablo to perform during their routine. A&T is not fazed by this and performs their mix of retro and current sounds. A tie results and the Morris Brown and A&T drumlines face off. Dr. Lee tells Devon he can play for this face-off, showing his faith in Devon's improved character and in thanks for all the hard work he has done in getting the band ready for the Classic. Morris Brown goes first and A&T responds. Morris Brown's second cadence includes their snares moving forward and playing on the A&T drums , then throwing down their sticks. The A&T line manages to hold their composure in the face of the insult. They play their cadence and in the middle throw down their sticks, mimicking the Morris Brown actions, but then the entire line pulls out another set of sticks and continues playing. They end their routine in the faces of the Morris Brown drumline, but instead of playing on their drums, the line all drop their sticks onto the other drumline's drums. The judges award the win to A&T.

28327The film begins in 1928, where Professor Langford discovers a massive cover-stone ring in the sands of Giza, Egypt. In the present day, Langford's daughter Catherine offers Egyptologist Daniel Jackson, a down-on-his-luck linguistics professor, the chance to translate ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs that may prove his controversial theory regarding the Pyramid of Khufu. Jackson accepts and travels to a US Air Force installation inside Creek Mountain, Colorado. Jackson translates the hieroglyphs on the stone ring's coverstones, which read: ""A million years into the sky is Ra. Sealed and buried for all time, his Stargate."" Formerly retired Special Forces Colonel Jack O'Neil arrives to take command of the project and declares it classified. Jackson deduces that the symbols are star constellations that are coordinates for a location within space. The sequence is entered into the stargate, creating a wormhole to a location in another galaxy. Catherine gives Jackson the eye-of-Ra medallion she originally got from the discovery site. After O'Neil leads a team through the Stargate, they find themselves inside a pyramid in the middle of vast sand dunes. Jackson reveals they cannot dial home because the Stargate coordinates to go back to Earth are missing. Some team members stay at the pyramid while Jackson, O'Neil, and others go out and discover a mining village inhabited by humans who, when they see Jackson's medallion, assume them to be gods sent by Ra. Jackson realizes that the people speak a dialect of Ancient Egyptian and begins communicating with them. He discovers that writing is forbidden to these people. The team develops friendships with the people: O'Neil with Skaara; Kawalsky and Ferretti with Skaara's friends; and Jackson  begins an unintended budding romance with Sha'uri, a daughter of the leader. Discovering that Sha'uri has some experience with drawn symbols, Jackson indicates to her that he wants to see more signs, and with her help leaves the city and learns from hieroglyphs in the people's hidden catacombs how the Egyptian god Ra was actually an alien lifeform who had abandoned his dying world to seek a cure for his own mortality, and had finally come to earth, where he ""possessed"" the body of one human youth like a parasite, and enslaved humans with his advanced technology. While these humans eventually rebelled and buried the Stargate, thousands of others had been taken to the other planet through the Stargate and used to mine the quartzite-like mineral on which all of Ra's technology is based. Fearing another rebellion on this planet, Ra outlawed reading and writing. At this point, the team from Earth discovers the cartouche containing the symbols required to get back to Earth, but the seventh symbol at the bottom is eroded away. O'Neil orders the team to return to the pyramid. A short time later, a huge pyramidal-form spacecraft descends over the pyramid, covering it entirely. All team members in the pyramid are either killed or taken into the pyramidal craft by means of transport-rings made of the power-mineral. O'Neil and Jackson are escorted to the throne room, where they meet Ra. Despite wearing fearsome armor in the forms of Anubis and Horus, Ra's guards and servants are human; a blue-jewelled button on each of their wrist-guards is activated to retract the metallic god-masks over their heads and into their collars. Ra retracts his own imperious metal head-mask. He appears to be a human youth, but the whites of his eyes frequently glow with light. Ra reveals his intention to send the atomic bomb brought by O'Neil, which was to be used to destroy the Stargate to prevent invasion if a threat is discovered, back to Earth; its destructive power is now to be enhanced 100-fold with an accompanying shipment of his quartzite-like material to produce cataclysmic results. O'Neil attempts to disarm the guards and kill Ra, but relents when Ra uses his children courtiers as human shields. Jackson is killed during the altercation. O'Neil is thrown into a dungeon with the captured team members, while Jackson is regenerated in a sarcophagus-like device. Ra states that he will kill Jackson and everyone who has seen him unless Jackson kills the rest of the team to show the villagers that Ra is their one true god. However, once Ra has the local people gathered before the pyramid craft, several young villagers signal to Jackson that they have recovered the team's weapons. Jackson, who has been handed a guard's staff-weapon for the execution, swiftly turns and shoots at Ra while the kids create a diversion. O'Neil, Jackson, and the rest of the team flee the site of Ra's ship and take shelter in a cave with the boys. The next morning, when Skaara draws a picture of the people's victory against Ra, Jackson realizes that part of this drawing depicts the seventh symbol needed to reactivate the Stargate: three moons over a pyramid. O'Neil and the resistance youths disguised as slave-workers, by suddenly overpowering and killing their overseers and retracting the metal god-masks they wore, convince the locals that their ""gods"" are mere mortals and, with their help, O'Neil, Jackson, and the remaining members of the team make it back to the Stargate hoping to deactivate the bomb. Ra executes one of his guards for failure to find them. When the locals begin an open rebellion against Ra's troops, Ra decides to retreat and prepares his ship for takeoff. Sha'uri is killed in the battle, but Jackson using a dead guard's wrist-mechanism activates the ring transporter and resurrects her in Ra's sarcophagus. Ra meanwhile orders the bomb and minerals to be sent to earth immediately. His chief guard boasts that he will do it himself, activates the transporter rings, descends to the stargate chamber and battles O'Neil. Jackson in the ship takes the unconscious Sha'uri to the transport site and man"

It is clear, however, that they have barely been surviving as zombies overwhelm them. The footage of the ""birthday"" is archived by a military photographer, Jones, who documents his teams efforts of surviving the zombie onslaught in a remote beachside compound. There, they take in survivors, both infected and not, including the sole survivor of the last movies original film crew, Leanne . Together, along with a medical officer, the team attempts to hold out as long as possible. Things take a turn for the worse, as zombies break in and overrun the facility. Only Leanne, Jones, and a hand full of soldiers make it out alive, forced to leave behind one of their own. The survivors find their way to a remote cabin where they attempt to hold up for the night as it begins snowing. However, the zombie population has grown too much for anywhere to be safe and they are once more forced to flee. With their transportation incapacitated, they make a dangerous trek through the brutal outdoors at night. The next day, the survivors continue to seek any kind of sanctuary. While walking in the woods, they discover booby-traps and the macabre remains of dispatched zombies. Figuring it to be human bandits, they carefully avoid numerous traps, until they come across the enemy hideout. It is here they discover the true enemies of the living, a bastion of psychopathic renegades led by the notorious Goke . Hardened by the elements, Goke is once again aided by his sidekick Manny and several other humans, that he leads with no discrimination. Two of the soldiers, Jones and Carter, secretly witness Goke's men sexually assault an infected female, until the leader steps out and shoots her in the head before chastising them. Jones and Carter return to the others to inform them of the situation before falling back into the woods. Leanne, at this point, had yet to see her past tormentors, however she recognises the grim location she had been found prior to the movies opening. Throughout the day, the soldiers and Leanne use hand to hand tactics against the undead to keep the bandits from knowing their location. They continue this until night as they camp, each survivor divulging their personal lives as it is now clear that there is indeed hope... a ship preparing to leave. Their discussion is cut short as they hear the sounds of someone nearby, discovering that the bandits are in fact searching for them. Tragedy strikes as Leanne is discovered and reunited with Goke and Manny. Uninterested in raping her again, Goke promises that she will have a special fate. The soldiers, in hiding, strike against the gang and rescue Leanne. In the shootout, zombies overwhelm both sides as Carter is unfortunately shot and subsequently devoured. As Leanne and the soldiers are once again forced into the night, they find themselves in a cemetery while the bandits dispatch the living dead. As another dawn once again gives the survivors light, they are unfortunately captured after a devastating shootout leaving the last female soldiers, Kayne , injured. Fate is once again cruel to Leanne, as she and her fellow captives are once again in the same barn the military rescued her from. Goke, Manny and his crew subdue and tie up the survivors, keeping Kayne separated as well as taking control of Jones' camera. Goke sets his evil sights on torturing them, having a mentally impaired follower named Billy beat the teams leader. Leanne even goes as far as to call Goke by his name, begging him to stop. He does not, allowing Billy to violently assault the leader. Goke and Billy enter the next room to find Manny torturing the injured Kayne. they then prepare Billy for ""initiation"", by raping her. Hesitant throughout, Billy is physically forced to sexually assault and stab the woman to death. Before Goke can rape her dead body, gunshots are heard in the next room. The three reenter the holding room of the barn to find that all the survivors are still tied up and one of his men shot dead, a victim of Nicholson, the soldier left behind in the beginning of the movie who had been following behind his comrades all along. Another psycho, Curtis, has his throat slit and Manny is shot. Goke manages to flee outside and after a short shootout, escapes. Having been freed by Nicholson, Leanne oversees an injured Manny who taunts her before meeting a bloody end at the young woman's shotgun. After the burial and mourning for Kayne, the soldiers leader, Maddox, is interrogated by the others who discover the truth of the UK's fate. A large scale firebombing has been ordered for the next morning. With his hopes set on the boats, Maddox leads Jones, Leanne and Nicholson to a nearby bunker where the last known military holdout was known to be. The soldiers of the bunker are all dead, leaving the survivors in a state of panic. Maddox, close to losing all hope, runs out to find where the soldiers had left markers for the boats which never came. Insistent on waiting, despite the sounds of the jets overhead, he remains behind as the others engage in combat against an army of zombies. While Jonesy, Nicholson and Leeann are still in the bunker, zombies come in surrounding them. Nicholson orders them to fight but Jonesy is too scared and can only watch.

10556722The film is set in the futuristic Metro City, a metropolis which floats in the sky above the polluted ""Surface"". Metro City's population is aided by a multitude of different robots who are dumped on the Surface when broken or disused. Toby, son of Dr. Tenma, learns that his father is going to show President Stone, the militaristic leader of the city, the Peacekeeper, a new guardian robot that he's been working on. Doctor Elefun, one of Tenma's colleagues, introduces Stone to the Blue and Red Cores, two energy spheres mined from a star fragment, that produce energy which can power robots via positive and negative energy, respectively. Stone places the Red Core in the Peacekeeper, causing it to go out of control. The Peacekeeper tries to attack the humans, but Tenma puts a barrier between them. Meanwhile, Toby has been released early from school, and rewires Orrin, his family's robot, in order to attend the Ministry of Science's demonstration of the Peacekeeper. Seeking to have a closer look at the Peacekeeper, Toby enters the same room as the robot, only for the Peacekeeper's first attempt to destroy the barrier to backfire with the result that Toby is totally annihilated. After the Peacekeeper is stopped by security forces, Dr. Tenma, wracked with despair, builds an identical robotic clone of Toby, using DNA from a strand of his hair to obtain his memories, which will make the robot think he is Toby. He also powers the robot with the positive blue core. The robot quickly comes to life, and Tenma brings him home. Tenma quickly realizes that while the robot possesses Toby's memories, it is not exactly like his original son, as the robot's higher mental and physical powers frequently remind him. Tenma had initially included the robot's powers in order to prevent his ""son"" from being destroyed again. Unaware that he is a robot, Toby tries to figure out why he can understand the language of some robot cleaners and discovers he can fly via rocket-boosters hidden in his shoes. He discovers various other abilities and heads home to tell his father, only to find that Tenma and Elefun are discussing deactivating him. Tenma reveals to Toby that he is a robot. President Stone's men detect the Blue Core's energy signature and pursue Toby. Stone calls in the Spirit of Freedom: a massive, heavily-armed, flying battleship. Rendered unconscious, Toby falls off the floating city and lands in the junkyard below. He meets several children including Cora, a girl who left Metro City after her parents neglected her, and a robotic dog named Trashcan. Toby meets the Robot Revolution Front: Sparx, Robotsky and Mike the Fridge, who easily identify Toby as a robot and rename him ""Astro"". Astro goes along with his new name and lives with the children and their fatherly figure, Hamegg, who appears to care for broken robots, but secretly treats robots just as callously as Stone, and also runs the Robot Games: destructive gladiatorial matches in which robots are forced to fight to the death. Astro and his friends find an offline construction robot named ZOG, and Astro secretly revives ZOG. The kids bring him back and clean him up for the Hamegg games. Later that night, Astro comes across Cora trying to call Metrocity. She reveals to him that she actually has parents and was worried if they even missed her. Astro promises not to tell and tries to tell her his secret but can't. The next day at the Hamegg games, Hamegg betrays Astro, learning of him being a robot, and pits Astro against other robots in the Robot Games. Unable to simply leave, Astro reluctantly destroys all the robots. Hamegg releases ZOG for Astro to fight, but both refuse to fight one another. Stone and his men arrive then and arrest Astro. They take him back to the Ministry of Science, where Tenma is asked to remove the Blue Core; however, at the last moment, he has a change of heart, accepting that even if Astro is not Toby, he is still his son, and allows Astro to escape. Stone places the Red Core into the Peacekeeper again, only for it to absorb him and take on his consciousness.

While on route to their destination, the jeep breaks down and they abandon the jeep. Despite protestations, they commandeer the refugees' wheelbarrow, and set off cross-country on foot. The refugees get the vehicle started and make use of it themselves. Meanwhile, the Italian troops who are treated as inferiors by their German counterparts, are given rations. The fact that they are allotted half rations causes a riot. The Germans also wish the Italians to take on the lesser task of confronting the partisans, rather than take on the Americans directly for their own gain. When the two Italian parties meet they are reluctant to fight, the partisans coerce some men to swap sides. When the Italian troops run into the pseudo-partisans, some of them become Communist sympathizers to avoid death. Their leader is shot and his two henchmen are recruited into the army. The Americans take shelter in a farm overnight. A majority of them are of Italian descent, including one socially accepted combat-soldier who accompanies them. An alleged Scottish resident sheltering with them is actually a German spy and radios their position to the German army officer who is constantly having trouble with cut communication cables. The Italian troops bravely resist in a confrontation with the quartermaster group, yet are later faced with a tank, killing a lead member of their group. The quartermasters reach the front line until they are requested to help with the battle by engaging the Germans directly. The Germans have the disadvantage of not directly engaging with the partisans because communication cable lines are constantly cut. The Germans are ordered to retreat except for the commanding officer himself, one sergeant and an earlier soldier who has lost his leg in the course of combat. The volunteers stay behind knowing that they will certainly die. The main opposing officer and unnamed soldier take position in a machine gun nest for their last stand. They make a heroic effort, all dying in the process, while taking as many Americans with them as possible, finally being killed by the crazy American deserter whom we meet in the beginning of the film.

Glen quickly turns the truck around and backs Willy into the water, flooding his truck in the process. Willy is finally released into the water, but Dial and his goons attempt to stop them. During the struggle, Jesse gets Willy to swim away, but panics when he sees that Dial has the whaling company to back him up when their boats show up in the water. They release nets and Jesse has one last chance to get Willy away before he becomes trapped. He runs towards a wall of rocks, calling for Willy to follow him, which steers him away from the boats. Jesse goes to the edge of the rocks where Willy swims up to him and tells Willy that if he makes the jump , he'll be free.

She considers her jijaji to be highly intellectual and looks upon him as her idol. Parimal develops an inferiority complex thanks to Sulekha's excessive praise of her jijaji and decides to prove that he is in no way a lesser mortal. Jijaji, meanwhile, has written a letter to Haripad bhaiyya  asking him to send a driver who can speak good Hindi because his present driver James D'costa  uses improper grammar. This provides the perfect opportunity for Parimal to get to see and interact with jijaji. Parimal becomes Pyaremohan Ilahabadi, a motor-mouth driver who pretends to hate the English language and so speaks only Hindi. So begins the comedy of errors, as Parimal and Sulekha play prank after prank on the unsuspecting jijaji.

Thus jijaji comes to comprehend the whole enactment, finally admitting that he was truly fooled. The film revolves around the resolution of these funny mishaps.
31439778 A gang of heavily armed men scour and finally narrow down on a house in Wasseypur. They surround the house and unleash a wave of bullets and grenades on it with the intention of killing the family inside it. After heavy firing on the house, they retreat away from the crime scene in a vehicle, convinced they have killed everyone within. The leader of the gang then calls one JP Singh  on his cell phone and reports that the family have been successfully executed but he is double crossed by JP Singh as a fire fight erupts between them and a police check post blocking their escape route. The scene cuts abruptly for a prologue by the narrator, Nasir.  The narration describes the history and nature of Wasseypur. The village has been historically ruled by the Qureshi Muslims, a sub-caste of animal butchers who are feared by the non-Qureshi Muslims in Wasseypur and Dhanbad by extension. During the British Raj, the British seized the farm lands of Dhanbad for coal which began the business of coal mining in Dhanbad. The region was a hotbed of the local faceless dacoit Sultana Qureshi who robbed British trains in the night and thus holds some patriotic value for the locals.  Shahid Khan , a Pathan, takes advantage of the mysteriousness of the faceless dacoit Sultana, a Qureshi, by impersonating his identity to rob British ferry trains. The Qureshi clans eventually find out and order the banishment of Shahid Khan and his family from Wasseypur. They settle down in Dhanbad where Shahid begins work as a labourer in a coal mine. He is unable to be at his wife's side who dies during childbirth. The enraged Shahid kills the coal-mines muscleman who had denied him leave on that day. In 1947, Independent India begins to assert its authority over itself. The British coal mines are sold to Indian industrialists and Ramadhir Singh  receives a few coal-mines in the Dhanbad region. He hires Shahid as the new muscle-man of the coal mine who terrorizes the local population to seize their lands and extract compliance. On a rainy day, Ramadhir Singh overhears Shahid's ambitions of taking over the coal mines from him. Singh tricks Shahid to travel to Varanasi for business but instead, he is murdered. Nasir finds Ramadhir's umbrella with his initials near the door, concluding that Ramadhir eavesdropped on their conversation. He flees from the place with Shahid's son Sardar in the nick of time as Ehsaan Qureshi , another associate of Ramaadhir Singh shows up too late for killing them. An unsuccessful Ehsaan lies to Singh that Shahid's family has been murdered and buried. Sardar grows along with his cousin Asghar  and learns the truth about his fathers death upon which he shaves his head vowing not to grow it until Ramadhir singh is dead.  Ramadhir Singh establishes himself in the coal mining by misusing his position and power as a trade union leader by turning it into a mafia organisation threatening labourers into giving a substantial portion of their income to Ramaadhir's henchmen. Singh encourages the labourers to dip the coal ores into water to fake production output.  The coal mines are nationalised. A mature Sardar Khan  and his kins start hijacking Ramaadhir's coal trucks mid transit but Ramadhir Singh suspects the foul play on SP Sinha, a Coal India official and murders him. Post Sinha's murder, Ramaadhir starts being feared by everyone in Dhanbad. Sardar marries Nagma Khatoon . The pregnant Khatoon confronts Sardar Khan and a prostitute inside a brothel and chases him away. Later, Nagma gives birth to Danish but gets pregnant immediately afterwards. Unable to have sex with a pregnant Nagma, Sardar confesses his sexual frustrations with his kins. At dinner, Nagma gives her consent to Sardar to sleep with other women but with the condition that he won't bring them home or dishonour the family name. Sardar and Asghar start working for JP Singh. They misuse their employment by secretly selling the company petrol in the black market. Later, they rob a petrol pump and a train bogey belonging to the Singh family. They usurp Singh's land leading which forces the two families to confront each other for talks. The meeting ends in a scuffle with Ramaadhir Singh realising that Sardar Khan is in fact the son of Shahid khan who he had murdered in the late 40s. Sardar and Asghar are sent for jail time for hitting JP Singh.  Sardar and Asghar escape from the jail. While hiding in Wasseyur, Sardar marries a Bengali Hindu girl named Durga . Asghar informs Nagma that Sardar has taken a second wife leaving Nagma helpless at the situation. Meanwhile, Wasseypur has merged with Dhanbad where the Qureshi goons terrorize the non-Qureshi Muslims. The locals approach Sardar Khan for help. During Muharram, both Shias and Sunnis are out mourning including the Qureshi clan. Sardar uses the opportunity to launch a major bomb attack on many Qureshi shops and houses. The word spreads about Sardar's raids and the people start fearing Sardar more than the Qureshis. Eventually, Sardar returns home to Nagma and she gets pregnant again. Sardar tries to initiate sex with a pregnant Nagma but she refuses which prompts an angry Sardar to leave her. He goes to stay with his second wife, Durga where she gives birth to his son, Definite. Ramaadhir Singh, noticing that Sardar has abandoned his first family, tries to reach out through Danish by giving him money. An enraged Nagma beats Danish for taking the money while she breaks down in front of Nasir. A thirsty Faizal wakes up in the middle of the night to find Nagma and Nasir about to have sex. Angry, he storms out of the house and becomes a junkie. Nasir reveals that the desires were never consummated. Faizal and Nasir never see eye to eye again.  Sensing Sardar's increasing clout, Ramaadhir calls his old associate Ehsaan Qureshi who brokers a meeting between Sultan Qureshi and Ramaadhir Singh where the two decide to become allies against their common enemy, Sardar Khan. Sultan asks Ramaadhir for modern automatic weapons which the latter promises to give.  Sardar becomes the most feared man in Wasseypur and shifts his business to stealing iron ore. Danish Khan joins in the family business. A failed attack from Sultan Qureshi leaves Danish with a minor injury and causes reconciliation between Sardar and Nagma. Sardar finds Ramaadhir and warns him of terrible consequences if anything ever happens to his family. A mature Faizal is seriously affected by Bollywood movies as he starts behaving, talking and dressing like Bollywood characters. Faizal is caught by the police for buying guns and jailed. Upon release, he kills the gun-seller who had implicated him to police earlier. Meanwhile, Sardar seizes a lake belonging to a local temple and charges commission on fish sellers who make a catch in that lake. An uneasy peace is maintained between the Qureshi and Khan families when Danish Khan marries Shama Parveen, the sister of Sultan Qureshi. Faizal reveals to a friend that his father Sardar would be travelling without security the next day.

Upon graduating, Devon heads to Atlanta, Georgia to attend the fictitious Atlanta A&T University, a historically black college that takes enormous pride in its marching band. Devon was personally invited to attend on full scholarship by Dr. Lee , head of the band, for his prodigious talents. The A&T band separates itself from its competitors by requiring all members to read music, by focusing on various styles of music rather than what music is currently popular on the radio, and by dedication to the teamwork emphasized ""one band, one sound"" concept. The band has a preseason that is similar to an athletic team's induction in that it is very physically and mentally difficult. It challenges all recruits to push themselves past what they previously thought were their limits. At the end of preseason, the musicians audition for spots on the field, and Devon is the only freshman to make P1, the highest level player. While going through his rigorous process, Devon also finds time to romance an upperclassman dancer, Laila . College life starts well for Devon, as he has the girl and a spot on the field. Things begin to sour when Sean , Devon's percussion leader, begins to grow weary of Devon's cocky attitude. Sean later challenges Devon to take a solo in his first game, believing the freshman will panic and be embarrassed in front of everyone. Sean is shocked when Devon takes the solo and is subsequently humiliated. This sets up some tension in the drumline which is exacerbated when Dr. Lee is told by President Wagner , the school's president, to change his focus from music to entertainment or lose his funding. Lee does not want to give Devon more playing time because he feels Devon's attitude and respect are lacking. The situation further deteriorates when it is revealed that Devon cannot read music. Devon is demoted to P4 by Dr. Lee until he learns, then later put back on P1 when Wagner pressures Dr. Lee to do so. However, after inflaming a melee with a visiting band at A&T's homecoming game after Devon plays on an opposing band member's drum, Devon is finally kicked out of the band by Dr. Lee. The fight also harms his relationship with Laila as she is embarrassed to introduce him to her parents, who attended the game and thought of Devon as a hoodlum. Devon contacts A&T's rival school Morris Brown College, to discuss playing for their band next season. Mr. Wade , Brown's band leader, says that Devon does not need to know how to read music and will likely get a full scholarship and a good position on the drumline. When Wade wants to know what Dr. Lee is planning for the BET Big Southern Classic , Devon realizes that his heart and honor are still with the A&T band. He rejects the scholarship offer from the rival band and returns to A&T. Though Devon is still not playing for the band, he cannot give up his drumming. He is sent cassette tapes from his estranged father and gets some ideas for new drum arrangements. He and Sean have a final confrontation that clears the air and they begin to work together. The two present their idea for an entrance cadence to Dr. Lee who decides they will be used during the Classic. Devon helps the drumline prepare and patches up his relationship with Laila. Lee also tells Devon that he can guarantee him a full return to the band next year. At the Classic, the bands are shown performing a mixture of popular songs. Morris Brown's band even gets rapper Petey Pablo to perform during their routine. A&T is not fazed by this and performs their mix of retro and current sounds. A tie results and the Morris Brown and A&T drumlines face off. Dr. Lee tells Devon he can play for this face-off, showing his faith in Devon's improved character and in thanks for all the hard work he has done in getting the band ready for the Classic. Morris Brown goes first and A&T responds. Morris Brown's second cadence includes their snares moving forward and playing on the A&T drums , then throwing down their sticks. The A&T line manages to hold their composure in the face of the insult. They play their cadence and in the middle throw down their sticks, mimicking the Morris Brown actions, but then the entire line pulls out another set of sticks and continues playing. They end their routine in the faces of the Morris Brown drumline, but instead of playing on their drums, the line all drop their sticks onto the other drumline's drums. The judges award the win to A&T.

28327The film begins in 1928, where Professor Langford discovers a massive cover-stone ring in the sands of Giza, Egypt. In the present day, Langford's daughter Catherine offers Egyptologist Daniel Jackson, a down-on-his-luck linguistics professor, the chance to translate ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs that may prove his controversial theory regarding the Pyramid of Khufu. Jackson accepts and travels to a US Air Force installation inside Creek Mountain, Colorado. Jackson translates the hieroglyphs on the stone ring's coverstones, which read: ""A million years into the sky is Ra. Sealed and buried for all time, his Stargate."" Formerly retired Special Forces Colonel Jack O'Neil arrives to take command of the project and declares it classified. Jackson deduces that the symbols are star constellations that are coordinates for a location within space. The sequence is entered into the stargate, creating a wormhole to a location in another galaxy. Catherine gives Jackson the eye-of-Ra medallion she originally got from the discovery site. After O'Neil leads a team through the Stargate, they find themselves inside a pyramid in the middle of vast sand dunes. Jackson reveals they cannot dial home because the Stargate coordinates to go back to Earth are missing. Some team members stay at the pyramid while Jackson, O'Neil, and others go out and discover a mining village inhabited by humans who, when they see Jackson's medallion, assume them to be gods sent by Ra. Jackson realizes that the people speak a dialect of Ancient Egyptian and begins communicating with them. He discovers that writing is forbidden to these people. The team develops friendships with the people: O'Neil with Skaara; Kawalsky and Ferretti with Skaara's friends; and Jackson  begins an unintended budding romance with Sha'uri, a daughter of the leader. Discovering that Sha'uri has some experience with drawn symbols, Jackson indicates to her that he wants to see more signs, and with her help leaves the city and learns from hieroglyphs in the people's hidden catacombs how the Egyptian god Ra was actually an alien lifeform who had abandoned his dying world to seek a cure for his own mortality, and had finally come to earth, where he ""possessed"" the body of one human youth like a parasite, and enslaved humans with his advanced technology. While these humans eventually rebelled and buried the Stargate, thousands of others had been taken to the other planet through the Stargate and used to mine the quartzite-like mineral on which all of Ra's technology is based. Fearing another rebellion on this planet, Ra outlawed reading and writing. At this point, the team from Earth discovers the cartouche containing the symbols required to get back to Earth, but the seventh symbol at the bottom is eroded away. O'Neil orders the team to return to the pyramid. A short time later, a huge pyramidal-form spacecraft descends over the pyramid, covering it entirely. All team members in the pyramid are either killed or taken into the pyramidal craft by means of transport-rings made of the power-mineral. O'Neil and Jackson are escorted to the throne room, where they meet Ra. Despite wearing fearsome armor in the forms of Anubis and Horus, Ra's guards and servants are human; a blue-jewelled button on each of their wrist-guards is activated to retract the metallic god-masks over their heads and into their collars. Ra retracts his own imperious metal head-mask. He appears to be a human youth, but the whites of his eyes frequently glow with light. Ra reveals his intention to send the atomic bomb brought by O'Neil, which was to be used to destroy the Stargate to prevent invasion if a threat is discovered, back to Earth; its destructive power is now to be enhanced 100-fold with an accompanying shipment of his quartzite-like material to produce cataclysmic results. O'Neil attempts to disarm the guards and kill Ra, but relents when Ra uses his children courtiers as human shields. Jackson is killed during the altercation. O'Neil is thrown into a dungeon with the captured team members, while Jackson is regenerated in a sarcophagus-like device. Ra states that he will kill Jackson and everyone who has seen him unless Jackson kills the rest of the team to show the villagers that Ra is their one true god. However, once Ra has the local people gathered before the pyramid craft, several young villagers signal to Jackson that they have recovered the team's weapons. Jackson, who has been handed a guard's staff-weapon for the execution, swiftly turns and shoots at Ra while the kids create a diversion. O'Neil, Jackson, and the rest of the team flee the site of Ra's ship and take shelter in a cave with the boys. The next morning, when Skaara draws a picture of the people's victory against Ra, Jackson realizes that part of this drawing depicts the seventh symbol needed to reactivate the Stargate: three moons over a pyramid. O'Neil and the resistance youths disguised as slave-workers, by suddenly overpowering and killing their overseers and retracting the metal god-masks they wore, convince the locals that their ""gods"" are mere mortals and, with their help, O'Neil, Jackson, and the remaining members of the team make it back to the Stargate hoping to deactivate the bomb. Ra executes one of his guards for failure to find them. When the locals begin an open rebellion against Ra's troops, Ra decides to retreat and prepares his ship for takeoff. Sha'uri is killed in the battle, but Jackson using a dead guard's wrist-mechanism activates the ring transporter and resurrects her in Ra's sarcophagus. Ra meanwhile orders the bomb and minerals to be sent to earth immediately. His chief guard boasts that he will do it himself, activates the transporter rings, descends to the stargate chamber and battles O'Neil. Jackson in the ship takes the unconscious Sha'uri to the transport site and man"

32428439A family is holding a birthday for their daughter during the apocalypse, maintaining the illusion things are still normal despite their only light source being a camcorder and birthday candles. It is clear, however, that they have barely been surviving as zombies overwhelm them. The footage of the ""birthday"" is archived by a military photographer, Jones, who documents his teams efforts of surviving the zombie onslaught in a remote beachside compound. There, they take in survivors, both infected and not, including the sole survivor of the last movies original film crew, Leanne . Together, along with a medical officer, the team attempts to hold out as long as possible. Things take a turn for the worse, as zombies break in and overrun the facility. Only Leanne, Jones, and a hand full of soldiers make it out alive, forced to leave behind one of their own. The survivors find their way to a remote cabin where they attempt to hold up for the night as it begins snowing. However, the zombie population has grown too much for anywhere to be safe and they are once more forced to flee. With their transportation incapacitated, they make a dangerous trek through the brutal outdoors at night. The next day, the survivors continue to seek any kind of sanctuary. While walking in the woods, they discover booby-traps and the macabre remains of dispatched zombies. Figuring it to be human bandits, they carefully avoid numerous traps, until they come across the enemy hideout. It is here they discover the true enemies of the living, a bastion of psychopathic renegades led by the notorious Goke . Hardened by the elements, Goke is once again aided by his sidekick Manny and several other humans, that he leads with no discrimination. Two of the soldiers, Jones and Carter, secretly witness Goke's men sexually assault an infected female, until the leader steps out and shoots her in the head before chastising them. Jones and Carter return to the others to inform them of the situation before falling back into the woods. Leanne, at this point, had yet to see her past tormentors, however she recognises the grim location she had been found prior to the movies opening. Throughout the day, the soldiers and Leanne use hand to hand tactics against the undead to keep the bandits from knowing their location. They continue this until night as they camp, each survivor divulging their personal lives as it is now clear that there is indeed hope... a ship preparing to leave. Their discussion is cut short as they hear the sounds of someone nearby, discovering that the bandits are in fact searching for them. Tragedy strikes as Leanne is discovered and reunited with Goke and Manny. Uninterested in raping her again, Goke promises that she will have a special fate. The soldiers, in hiding, strike against the gang and rescue Leanne. In the shootout, zombies overwhelm both sides as Carter is unfortunately shot and subsequently devoured. As Leanne and the soldiers are once again forced into the night, they find themselves in a cemetery while the bandits dispatch the living dead. As another dawn once again gives the survivors light, they are unfortunately captured after a devastating shootout leaving the last female soldiers, Kayne , injured. Fate is once again cruel to Leanne, as she and her fellow captives are once again in the same barn the military rescued her from. Goke, Manny and his crew subdue and tie up the survivors, keeping Kayne separated as well as taking control of Jones' camera. Goke sets his evil sights on torturing them, having a mentally impaired follower named Billy beat the teams leader. Leanne even goes as far as to call Goke by his name, begging him to stop. He does not, allowing Billy to violently assault the leader. Goke and Billy enter the next room to find Manny torturing the injured Kayne. they then prepare Billy for ""initiation"", by raping her. Hesitant throughout, Billy is physically forced to sexually assault and stab the woman to death. Before Goke can rape her dead body, gunshots are heard in the next room. The three reenter the holding room of the barn to find that all the survivors are still tied up and one of his men shot dead, a victim of Nicholson, the soldier left behind in the beginning of the movie who had been following behind his comrades all along. Another psycho, Curtis, has his throat slit and Manny is shot. Goke manages to flee outside and after a short shootout, escapes. Having been freed by Nicholson, Leanne oversees an injured Manny who taunts her before meeting a bloody end at the young woman's shotgun. After the burial and mourning for Kayne, the soldiers leader, Maddox, is interrogated by the others who discover the truth of the UK's fate. A large scale firebombing has been ordered for the next morning. With his hopes set on the boats, Maddox leads Jones, Leanne and Nicholson to a nearby bunker where the last known military holdout was known to be. The soldiers of the bunker are all dead, leaving the survivors in a state of panic. Maddox, close to losing all hope, runs out to find where the soldiers had left markers for the boats which never came. Insistent on waiting, despite the sounds of the jets overhead, he remains behind as the others engage in combat against an army of zombies. While Jonesy, Nicholson and Leeann are still in the bunker, zombies come in surrounding them. Nicholson orders them to fight but Jonesy is too scared and can only watch. Nicholson is killed and Jonesy instead watches Leeann fight them herself but she tires out and falls and is killed as well. Jonesy then states his failure to the camera and commits suicide via pistol when a zombie grabs him. Footage throughout the film, show soldiers in hazmat gear gathering survivors and killing them to prevent further infection reveal them to be Jones, Maddox, Carter and Kayne, facing the psychological damage of slaughtering possible innocents and burning their remains during a time when the infection wasn't clear. For the last time, a camera blinks out. The ending of the film dispenses with the found footage approach and is presented in a traditional cinema style, showing Maddox as the sole survivor of the group. Walking the beach at sunrise, he is taken back at being alive as the beauty of sunrise gives an uncertain future. On the shoreline he stumbles across other survivors, a husband and his pregnant wife, who beg for his help after revealing they had come to the UK in seek of refuge from their destroyed city of Rotterdam in Holland.

10556722The film is set in the futuristic Metro City, a metropolis which floats in the sky above the polluted ""Surface"". Metro City's population is aided by a multitude of different robots who are dumped on the Surface when broken or disused. Toby, son of Dr. Tenma, learns that his father is going to show President Stone, the militaristic leader of the city, the Peacekeeper, a new guardian robot that he's been working on. Doctor Elefun, one of Tenma's colleagues, introduces Stone to the Blue and Red Cores, two energy spheres mined from a star fragment, that produce energy which can power robots via positive and negative energy, respectively. Stone places the Red Core in the Peacekeeper, causing it to go out of control. The Peacekeeper tries to attack the humans, but Tenma puts a barrier between them. Meanwhile, Toby has been released early from school, and rewires Orrin, his family's robot, in order to attend the Ministry of Science's demonstration of the Peacekeeper. Seeking to have a closer look at the Peacekeeper, Toby enters the same room as the robot, only for the Peacekeeper's first attempt to destroy the barrier to backfire with the result that Toby is totally annihilated. After the Peacekeeper is stopped by security forces, Dr. Tenma, wracked with despair, builds an identical robotic clone of Toby, using DNA from a strand of his hair to obtain his memories, which will make the robot think he is Toby. He also powers the robot with the positive blue core. The robot quickly comes to life, and Tenma brings him home. Tenma quickly realizes that while the robot possesses Toby's memories, it is not exactly like his original son, as the robot's higher mental and physical powers frequently remind him. Tenma had initially included the robot's powers in order to prevent his ""son"" from being destroyed again. Unaware that he is a robot, Toby tries to figure out why he can understand the language of some robot cleaners and discovers he can fly via rocket-boosters hidden in his shoes. He discovers various other abilities and heads home to tell his father, only to find that Tenma and Elefun are discussing deactivating him. Tenma reveals to Toby that he is a robot. President Stone's men detect the Blue Core's energy signature and pursue Toby. Stone calls in the Spirit of Freedom: a massive, heavily-armed, flying battleship. Rendered unconscious, Toby falls off the floating city and lands in the junkyard below. He meets several children including Cora, a girl who left Metro City after her parents neglected her, and a robotic dog named Trashcan. Toby meets the Robot Revolution Front: Sparx, Robotsky and Mike the Fridge, who easily identify Toby as a robot and rename him ""Astro"". Astro goes along with his new name and lives with the children and their fatherly figure, Hamegg, who appears to care for broken robots, but secretly treats robots just as callously as Stone, and also runs the Robot Games: destructive gladiatorial matches in which robots are forced to fight to the death. Astro and his friends find an offline construction robot named ZOG, and Astro secretly revives ZOG. The kids bring him back and clean him up for the Hamegg games. Later that night, Astro comes across Cora trying to call Metrocity. She reveals to him that she actually has parents and was worried if they even missed her. Astro promises not to tell and tries to tell her his secret but can't. The next day at the Hamegg games, Hamegg betrays Astro, learning of him being a robot, and pits Astro against other robots in the Robot Games. Unable to simply leave, Astro reluctantly destroys all the robots. Hamegg releases ZOG for Astro to fight, but both refuse to fight one another. Stone and his men arrive then and arrest Astro. They take him back to the Ministry of Science, where Tenma is asked to remove the Blue Core; however, at the last moment, he has a change of heart, accepting that even if Astro is not Toby, he is still his son, and allows Astro to escape. Stone places the Red Core into the Peacekeeper again, only for it to absorb him and take on his consciousness. Astro and Stone fight across the city, demolishing most of the buildings and causing the city to begin crashing to Earth. Astro is able to slow Metro City's decent by flying underneath and pushing upwards with his leg-rockets. Cora, the other children, and the Robot Revolution try to help to bring down the Peacekeeper/Stone fusion. Stone catches Astro and is about to absorb him, but when the Blue and Red Cores clash, he lets Astro out due to the close proximity of the two Cores causing him great pain. Astro lands in a building, where he reunites with Tenma. Tenma tells him that if the Blue Core and Red Core come together, Astro and the Peacekeeper will both die. Astro decides that this was the reason he was made, and flies straight toward Stone, crashing into him and merging the Cores which destroys the Peacekeeper and frees Stone . However, with both Cores drained of energy, Astro is deactivated. Cora, Dr. Elefun and others find Astro's body. ZOG transfers some of his Blue Core energy  to Astro; with the catalyst restarted, the Blue Core once more becomes a limitless source of energy, so Astro is easily revived and his wounds automatically heal. Astro is reunited with Dr. Tenma, and Cora finds and makes up with her parents. Stone awakes, only to be arrested by his own troops. When an alien life-form appears over the city, the movie ends with Astro flying up to battle it.

32535486A group of uniformed but inexperienced quartermasters are tasked with taking ammo to the front line. The American soldiers meet with an insane American deserter. While on route to their destination, the jeep breaks down and they abandon the jeep. Despite protestations, they commandeer the refugees' wheelbarrow, and set off cross-country on foot. The refugees get the vehicle started and make use of it themselves. Meanwhile, the Italian troops who are treated as inferiors by their German counterparts, are given rations. The fact that they are allotted half rations causes a riot. The Germans also wish the Italians to take on the lesser task of confronting the partisans, rather than take on the Americans directly for their own gain. When the two Italian parties meet they are reluctant to fight, the partisans coerce some men to swap sides. When the Italian troops run into the pseudo-partisans, some of them become Communist sympathizers to avoid death. Their leader is shot and his two henchmen are recruited into the army. The Americans take shelter in a farm overnight. A majority of them are of Italian descent, including one socially accepted combat-soldier who accompanies them. An alleged Scottish resident sheltering with them is actually a German spy and radios their position to the German army officer who is constantly having trouble with cut communication cables. The Italian troops bravely resist in a confrontation with the quartermaster group, yet are later faced with a tank, killing a lead member of their group. The quartermasters reach the front line until they are requested to help with the battle by engaging the Germans directly. The Germans have the disadvantage of not directly engaging with the partisans because communication cable lines are constantly cut. The Germans are ordered to retreat except for the commanding officer himself, one sergeant and an earlier soldier who has lost his leg in the course of combat. The volunteers stay behind knowing that they will certainly die. The main opposing officer and unnamed soldier take position in a machine gun nest for their last stand. They make a heroic effort, all dying in the process, while taking as many Americans with them as possible, finally being killed by the crazy American deserter whom we meet in the beginning of the film.

However, his social worker Dwight helps him avoid legal consequences by placing him in a foster home and provided he cleans up the mess at the park. While there, Jesse befriends Willy, the orca that was caught earlier and has a collapsed dorsal fin. He is amazed by Willy who obeys his commands, something the trainer, Rae Lindley , had failed to do. Over time, Jesse and Willy become the best of friends, and Jesse earns a long-term job at the marina while learning to live with his new and supportive foster parents, Glen  and Annie Greenwood . The owner of the amusement park, Dial  sees the talent Jesse and Willy have together, and makes large plans to host ""The Willy Show"" in hopes of boosting sales and making money for himself.

Later, while at the tank, Jesse notices Willy's family calling to him and Dial's assistant Wade  and other men sneaking into the underwater observation area and damage the tank enough that the water will gradually leak out in an effort to kill Willy. It is surmised that Dial is interested in collecting the insurance money, since he has a $1,000,000 life insurance policy on Willy. Thus, Jesse, Haida native Randolph Johnson  and Rae begin plans to release the orca. They use equipment at the park to load Willy onto a trailer, and Jesse and Randolph ""borrow"" Glen's truck to tow Willy to a marina. They try to stick to back roads to keep from being spotted with a gigantic orca, and eventually get stuck. Wade meanwhile notifies Dial that the orca is missing, and begin a search to find Willy. Jesse must admit that he needs help, and calls his foster parents using a CB-Radio in Glen's truck. Annie and Glen show up and help free the truck, and continue on to the marina to release Willy. Dial knows where they are likely headed, and when they show up, he, Wade and his henchmen are blocking the gate into the marina. Glen charges at them full speed in the truck, forcing the henchmen to move right before the truck plows through the gate to the marina. Glen quickly turns the truck around and backs Willy into the water, flooding his truck in the process. Willy is finally released into the water, but Dial and his goons attempt to stop them. During the struggle, Jesse gets Willy to swim away, but panics when he sees that Dial has the whaling company to back him up when their boats show up in the water. They release nets and Jesse has one last chance to get Willy away before he becomes trapped. He runs towards a wall of rocks, calling for Willy to follow him, which steers him away from the boats. Jesse goes to the edge of the rocks where Willy swims up to him and tells Willy that if he makes the jump , he'll be free. Jesse then starts to cry as he tells Willy goodbye, but pulls himself together and goes back to the top of the rocks. He says a prayer that Randolph taught him from a story from his tribe and throws his arm in the air, giving Willy the signal to jump. To the amazement of everyone, Willy makes the jump with no problem and is finally free to return to his family and escapes the boats. Everyone cheers, Willy leaps out of the water in celebration, and Jesse happily jumps up and down, but stops when he realizes that he'll probably never see Willy again. He goes back to Glen and Annie who hug him as they look out into the sea. Willy calls out to Jesse in the distance and both say their final farewell. The movie ends with Willy who has found his family and the entire pod swims and jumps through the ocean.

Meanwhile he disguises himself as the bungalow watchman to protect the old man's job. Sulekha finds out one day about the cover-up and is charmed on seeing Parimal's real personality. They both get married. Parimal loves playing pranks and is the antithesis of regular professors. Sulekha, on the other hand is in awe of her jijaji  Raghavendra . She considers her jijaji to be highly intellectual and looks upon him as her idol. Parimal develops an inferiority complex thanks to Sulekha's excessive praise of her jijaji and decides to prove that he is in no way a lesser mortal. Jijaji, meanwhile, has written a letter to Haripad bhaiyya  asking him to send a driver who can speak good Hindi because his present driver James D'costa  uses improper grammar. This provides the perfect opportunity for Parimal to get to see and interact with jijaji. Parimal becomes Pyaremohan Ilahabadi, a motor-mouth driver who pretends to hate the English language and so speaks only Hindi. So begins the comedy of errors, as Parimal and Sulekha play prank after prank on the unsuspecting jijaji. First they pretend that Sulekha is not happy with her new marriage, then they put across the impression that Sulekha is having an affair with Pyaremohan, and if that was not enough, they get Parimal’s long-time friend Sukumar Sinha , a Professor of English literature, to temporarily act as Parimal and portray him as a serious and boring lecturer, the complete opposite of Parimal's character. Pyaremohan's excessively refined Hindi, his habit of correcting jijaji's usage of the language and his persistence in getting jijaji to teach him English all serve to irk jijaji to no end and provide for many laughs. Parimal's long-time friend P K Srivastava  is also party to the prank. His sister-in-law Vasudha  suspects fake 'Parimal' - Sukumar Sinha - of infidelity to his wife 'Sulekha' when he tries to get close to her.

But toward the end, Sukumar and Vasudha end up marrying in a temple where Haripat bhaiyya coerces Pyaremohan to 'kill' himself so that Parimal could surface. Thus jijaji comes to comprehend the whole enactment, finally admitting that he was truly fooled. The film revolves around the resolution of these funny mishaps.
31439778 A gang of heavily armed men scour and finally narrow down on a house in Wasseypur. They surround the house and unleash a wave of bullets and grenades on it with the intention of killing the family inside it. After heavy firing on the house, they retreat away from the crime scene in a vehicle, convinced they have killed everyone within. The leader of the gang then calls one JP Singh  on his cell phone and reports that the family have been successfully executed but he is double crossed by JP Singh as a fire fight erupts between them and a police check post blocking their escape route. The scene cuts abruptly for a prologue by the narrator, Nasir.  The narration describes the history and nature of Wasseypur. The village has been historically ruled by the Qureshi Muslims, a sub-caste of animal butchers who are feared by the non-Qureshi Muslims in Wasseypur and Dhanbad by extension. During the British Raj, the British seized the farm lands of Dhanbad for coal which began the business of coal mining in Dhanbad. The region was a hotbed of the local faceless dacoit Sultana Qureshi who robbed British trains in the night and thus holds some patriotic value for the locals.  Shahid Khan , a Pathan, takes advantage of the mysteriousness of the faceless dacoit Sultana, a Qureshi, by impersonating his identity to rob British ferry trains. The Qureshi clans eventually find out and order the banishment of Shahid Khan and his family from Wasseypur. They settle down in Dhanbad where Shahid begins work as a labourer in a coal mine. He is unable to be at his wife's side who dies during childbirth. The enraged Shahid kills the coal-mines muscleman who had denied him leave on that day. In 1947, Independent India begins to assert its authority over itself. The British coal mines are sold to Indian industrialists and Ramadhir Singh  receives a few coal-mines in the Dhanbad region. He hires Shahid as the new muscle-man of the coal mine who terrorizes the local population to seize their lands and extract compliance. On a rainy day, Ramadhir Singh overhears Shahid's ambitions of taking over the coal mines from him. Singh tricks Shahid to travel to Varanasi for business but instead, he is murdered. Nasir finds Ramadhir's umbrella with his initials near the door, concluding that Ramadhir eavesdropped on their conversation. He flees from the place with Shahid's son Sardar in the nick of time as Ehsaan Qureshi , another associate of Ramaadhir Singh shows up too late for killing them. An unsuccessful Ehsaan lies to Singh that Shahid's family has been murdered and buried. Sardar grows along with his cousin Asghar  and learns the truth about his fathers death upon which he shaves his head vowing not to grow it until Ramadhir singh is dead.  Ramadhir Singh establishes himself in the coal mining by misusing his position and power as a trade union leader by turning it into a mafia organisation threatening labourers into giving a substantial portion of their income to Ramaadhir's henchmen. Singh encourages the labourers to dip the coal ores into water to fake production output.  The coal mines are nationalised. A mature Sardar Khan  and his kins start hijacking Ramaadhir's coal trucks mid transit but Ramadhir Singh suspects the foul play on SP Sinha, a Coal India official and murders him. Post Sinha's murder, Ramaadhir starts being feared by everyone in Dhanbad. Sardar marries Nagma Khatoon . The pregnant Khatoon confronts Sardar Khan and a prostitute inside a brothel and chases him away. Later, Nagma gives birth to Danish but gets pregnant immediately afterwards. Unable to have sex with a pregnant Nagma, Sardar confesses his sexual frustrations with his kins. At dinner, Nagma gives her consent to Sardar to sleep with other women but with the condition that he won't bring them home or dishonour the family name. Sardar and Asghar start working for JP Singh. They misuse their employment by secretly selling the company petrol in the black market. Later, they rob a petrol pump and a train bogey belonging to the Singh family. They usurp Singh's land leading which forces the two families to confront each other for talks. The meeting ends in a scuffle with Ramaadhir Singh realising that Sardar Khan is in fact the son of Shahid khan who he had murdered in the late 40s. Sardar and Asghar are sent for jail time for hitting JP Singh.  Sardar and Asghar escape from the jail. While hiding in Wasseyur, Sardar marries a Bengali Hindu girl named Durga . Asghar informs Nagma that Sardar has taken a second wife leaving Nagma helpless at the situation. Meanwhile, Wasseypur has merged with Dhanbad where the Qureshi goons terrorize the non-Qureshi Muslims. The locals approach Sardar Khan for help. During Muharram, both Shias and Sunnis are out mourning including the Qureshi clan. Sardar uses the opportunity to launch a major bomb attack on many Qureshi shops and houses. The word spreads about Sardar's raids and the people start fearing Sardar more than the Qureshis. Eventually, Sardar returns home to Nagma and she gets pregnant again. Sardar tries to initiate sex with a pregnant Nagma but she refuses which prompts an angry Sardar to leave her. He goes to stay with his second wife, Durga where she gives birth to his son, Definite. Ramaadhir Singh, noticing that Sardar has abandoned his first family, tries to reach out through Danish by giving him money. An enraged Nagma beats Danish for taking the money while she breaks down in front of Nasir. A thirsty Faizal wakes up in the middle of the night to find Nagma and Nasir about to have sex. Angry, he storms out of the house and becomes a junkie. Nasir reveals that the desires were never consummated. Faizal and Nasir never see eye to eye again.  Sensing Sardar's increasing clout, Ramaadhir calls his old associate Ehsaan Qureshi who brokers a meeting between Sultan Qureshi and Ramaadhir Singh where the two decide to become allies against their common enemy, Sardar Khan. Sultan asks Ramaadhir for modern automatic weapons which the latter promises to give.  Sardar becomes the most feared man in Wasseypur and shifts his business to stealing iron ore. Danish Khan joins in the family business. A failed attack from Sultan Qureshi leaves Danish with a minor injury and causes reconciliation between Sardar and Nagma. Sardar finds Ramaadhir and warns him of terrible consequences if anything ever happens to his family. A mature Faizal is seriously affected by Bollywood movies as he starts behaving, talking and dressing like Bollywood characters. Faizal is caught by the police for buying guns and jailed. Upon release, he kills the gun-seller who had implicated him to police earlier. Meanwhile, Sardar seizes a lake belonging to a local temple and charges commission on fish sellers who make a catch in that lake. An uneasy peace is maintained between the Qureshi and Khan families when Danish Khan marries Shama Parveen, the sister of Sultan Qureshi. Faizal reveals to a friend that his father Sardar would be travelling without security the next day. Late night, while Faizal is still asleep, his friend who turns out to be a spy calls up the Qureshis and passes this bit of information to them. Sardar leaves home alone and reaches the Durga household to give them their expense allowance. Durga turns out to be yet another Qureshi spy. The Qureshi men follow Sardars car and when the latter stops at a petrol pump to refuel they start shooting while Sardar ducks in the car for cover. The Qureshi men put several close rounds through the car window ensuring a precise & unmistakable hit after which they escape. A shocked Sardar opens the car door and stands up to reveal multiple bullet wounds, one directly on his head. He steps out with his gun drawn trying to locate the shooters but he eventually collapses to his death on a ferry cycle.  {{Main}}
2997971The story concerns Devon Miles , a teen who has just graduated from high school in New York City. Upon graduating, Devon heads to Atlanta, Georgia to attend the fictitious Atlanta A&T University, a historically black college that takes enormous pride in its marching band. Devon was personally invited to attend on full scholarship by Dr. Lee , head of the band, for his prodigious talents. The A&T band separates itself from its competitors by requiring all members to read music, by focusing on various styles of music rather than what music is currently popular on the radio, and by dedication to the teamwork emphasized ""one band, one sound"" concept. The band has a preseason that is similar to an athletic team's induction in that it is very physically and mentally difficult. It challenges all recruits to push themselves past what they previously thought were their limits. At the end of preseason, the musicians audition for spots on the field, and Devon is the only freshman to make P1, the highest level player. While going through his rigorous process, Devon also finds time to romance an upperclassman dancer, Laila . College life starts well for Devon, as he has the girl and a spot on the field. Things begin to sour when Sean , Devon's percussion leader, begins to grow weary of Devon's cocky attitude. Sean later challenges Devon to take a solo in his first game, believing the freshman will panic and be embarrassed in front of everyone. Sean is shocked when Devon takes the solo and is subsequently humiliated. This sets up some tension in the drumline which is exacerbated when Dr. Lee is told by President Wagner , the school's president, to change his focus from music to entertainment or lose his funding. Lee does not want to give Devon more playing time because he feels Devon's attitude and respect are lacking. The situation further deteriorates when it is revealed that Devon cannot read music. Devon is demoted to P4 by Dr. Lee until he learns, then later put back on P1 when Wagner pressures Dr. Lee to do so. However, after inflaming a melee with a visiting band at A&T's homecoming game after Devon plays on an opposing band member's drum, Devon is finally kicked out of the band by Dr. Lee. The fight also harms his relationship with Laila as she is embarrassed to introduce him to her parents, who attended the game and thought of Devon as a hoodlum. Devon contacts A&T's rival school Morris Brown College, to discuss playing for their band next season. Mr. Wade , Brown's band leader, says that Devon does not need to know how to read music and will likely get a full scholarship and a good position on the drumline. When Wade wants to know what Dr. Lee is planning for the BET Big Southern Classic , Devon realizes that his heart and honor are still with the A&T band. He rejects the scholarship offer from the rival band and returns to A&T. Though Devon is still not playing for the band, he cannot give up his drumming. He is sent cassette tapes from his estranged father and gets some ideas for new drum arrangements. He and Sean have a final confrontation that clears the air and they begin to work together. The two present their idea for an entrance cadence to Dr. Lee who decides they will be used during the Classic. Devon helps the drumline prepare and patches up his relationship with Laila. Lee also tells Devon that he can guarantee him a full return to the band next year. At the Classic, the bands are shown performing a mixture of popular songs. Morris Brown's band even gets rapper Petey Pablo to perform during their routine. A&T is not fazed by this and performs their mix of retro and current sounds. A tie results and the Morris Brown and A&T drumlines face off. Dr. Lee tells Devon he can play for this face-off, showing his faith in Devon's improved character and in thanks for all the hard work he has done in getting the band ready for the Classic. Morris Brown goes first and A&T responds. Morris Brown's second cadence includes their snares moving forward and playing on the A&T drums , then throwing down their sticks.

28327The film begins in 1928, where Professor Langford discovers a massive cover-stone ring in the sands of Giza, Egypt. In the present day, Langford's daughter Catherine offers Egyptologist Daniel Jackson, a down-on-his-luck linguistics professor, the chance to translate ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs that may prove his controversial theory regarding the Pyramid of Khufu. Jackson accepts and travels to a US Air Force installation inside Creek Mountain, Colorado. Jackson translates the hieroglyphs on the stone ring's coverstones, which read: ""A million years into the sky is Ra. Sealed and buried for all time, his Stargate."" Formerly retired Special Forces Colonel Jack O'Neil arrives to take command of the project and declares it classified. Jackson deduces that the symbols are star constellations that are coordinates for a location within space. The sequence is entered into the stargate, creating a wormhole to a location in another galaxy. Catherine gives Jackson the eye-of-Ra medallion she originally got from the discovery site. After O'Neil leads a team through the Stargate, they find themselves inside a pyramid in the middle of vast sand dunes. Jackson reveals they cannot dial home because the Stargate coordinates to go back to Earth are missing. Some team members stay at the pyramid while Jackson, O'Neil, and others go out and discover a mining village inhabited by humans who, when they see Jackson's medallion, assume them to be gods sent by Ra. Jackson realizes that the people speak a dialect of Ancient Egyptian and begins communicating with them. He discovers that writing is forbidden to these people. The team develops friendships with the people: O'Neil with Skaara; Kawalsky and Ferretti with Skaara's friends; and Jackson  begins an unintended budding romance with Sha'uri, a daughter of the leader. Discovering that Sha'uri has some experience with drawn symbols, Jackson indicates to her that he wants to see more signs, and with her help leaves the city and learns from hieroglyphs in the people's hidden catacombs how the Egyptian god Ra was actually an alien lifeform who had abandoned his dying world to seek a cure for his own mortality, and had finally come to earth, where he ""possessed"" the body of one human youth like a parasite, and enslaved humans with his advanced technology. While these humans eventually rebelled and buried the Stargate, thousands of others had been taken to the other planet through the Stargate and used to mine the quartzite-like mineral on which all of Ra's technology is based. Fearing another rebellion on this planet, Ra outlawed reading and writing. At this point, the team from Earth discovers the cartouche containing the symbols required to get back to Earth, but the seventh symbol at the bottom is eroded away. O'Neil orders the team to return to the pyramid. A short time later, a huge pyramidal-form spacecraft descends over the pyramid, covering it entirely. All team members in the pyramid are either killed or taken into the pyramidal craft by means of transport-rings made of the power-mineral. O'Neil and Jackson are escorted to the throne room, where they meet Ra. Despite wearing fearsome armor in the forms of Anubis and Horus, Ra's guards and servants are human; a blue-jewelled button on each of their wrist-guards is activated to retract the metallic god-masks over their heads and into their collars. Ra retracts his own imperious metal head-mask. He appears to be a human youth, but the whites of his eyes frequently glow with light. Ra reveals his intention to send the atomic bomb brought by O'Neil, which was to be used to destroy the Stargate to prevent invasion if a threat is discovered, back to Earth; its destructive power is now to be enhanced 100-fold with an accompanying shipment of his quartzite-like material to produce cataclysmic results. O'Neil attempts to disarm the guards and kill Ra, but relents when Ra uses his children courtiers as human shields. Jackson is killed during the altercation. O'Neil is thrown into a dungeon with the captured team members, while Jackson is regenerated in a sarcophagus-like device. Ra states that he will kill Jackson and everyone who has seen him unless Jackson kills the rest of the team to show the villagers that Ra is their one true god. However, once Ra has the local people gathered before the pyramid craft, several young villagers signal to Jackson that they have recovered the team's weapons. Jackson, who has been handed a guard's staff-weapon for the execution, swiftly turns and shoots at Ra while the kids create a diversion. O'Neil, Jackson, and the rest of the team flee the site of Ra's ship and take shelter in a cave with the boys. The next morning, when Skaara draws a picture of the people's victory against Ra, Jackson realizes that part of this drawing depicts the seventh symbol needed to reactivate the Stargate: three moons over a pyramid. O'Neil and the resistance youths disguised as slave-workers, by suddenly overpowering and killing their overseers and retracting the metal god-masks they wore, convince the locals that their ""gods"" are mere mortals and, with their help, O'Neil, Jackson, and the remaining members of the team make it back to the Stargate hoping to deactivate the bomb. Ra executes one of his guards for failure to find them. When the locals begin an open rebellion against Ra's troops, Ra decides to retreat and prepares his ship for takeoff. Sha'uri is killed in the battle, but Jackson using a dead guard's wrist-mechanism activates the ring transporter and resurrects her in Ra's sarcophagus. Ra meanwhile orders the bomb and minerals to be sent to earth immediately. His chief guard boasts that he will do it himself, activates the transporter rings, descends to the stargate chamber and battles O'Neil. Jackson in the ship takes the unconscious Sha'uri to the transport site and man"

He is alerted by an unknown and unseen presence stalking him, which causes him to gallop for the protection of the trees. He is followed by some unknown enemies who are chasing him, before they surround him and prepare to attack. Meanwhile, a boy and his parents, the last of the summer tourists, are forced to leave their dog behind because they knew that their pet would not be happy in the city and would be forced to send him back to the dog pound. Later that day, while trying to find shelter from a rainstorm, he is soon found by a pack of feral dogs, most of whom were abandoned pets belonging to summer tourists. Their leader, a massive golden-haired mongrel, immediately accepts the dog into his pack. Jerry  has moved to Seal Island with his new wife, Millie, and their two sons. They also brought along their family dog, a German Shepherd named Riley. While dropping off some garbage at the island junkyard, Jerry's dog chases after a rabbit into the trees, but is attacked by an unknown creature and injured in the right hind leg. When Jerry goes back to see what it was that attacked Riley, he discovered that it was a feral dog, who had apparently also stole the rabbit that his dog was chasing. He immediately sent word to the other residents on the island, including the old hermit Mr. McMinnimee, to keep a watchful eye out for the dog and kill it if they ever see it again. McMinnimee, who lives in a cabin alone with his German Shepherd Shazah, soon learns of the wild dog and returns to his home. When a storm hit the island one evening, McMinnimee's dog starts up a riot and tries to break out. The old man, armed with his rifle, opens the door to his cabin and tries to find out who is intruding onto his property. Shazah bolts out into the front yard, but is suddenly attacked by the golden-haired mongrel plus several feral dogs. McMinnimee is too late to save his dog from the pack, though he manages to shoot and kill a collie, one of the pack members. As he tries to secure the door and windows to his house, the dogs break through one of the windows and attack the old man, killing him. The following morning, while relaxing in her new house that Jerry had built for her, Millie notices that something is scaring their poultry. She goes outside and discovers the same mongrel that Jerry saw the other day lurking near the poultry yard. She tries to drive it off, but the dog growls at her and attacks, forcing Millie to seek refuge in her Volkswagen car. As the rest of the pack surround the car and try to break in, Jerry arrives and drives the dogs off, killing a Labrador retriever with his shotgun. He takes Millie to town, drops her off at one of the abandoned houses, and warns his neighbor Cobb of the pack. While Cobb leaves to warn the other islanders of the dogs, Jerry picks up his sons and takes them back to the house. Meanwhile, one of the islanders, Dodge moves to the island with his son Tommy, a cook Lois, and his wife Marge. The day after their arrival, Dodge urges his son Tommy to go for a walk, and Lois goes along with him. During their walk through the forest, Tommy hears the pack of dogs howling nearby and starts running for his life. Lois chases after Tommy, but quickly loses him and is forced to seek refuge in an abandoned barn where the dogs sleep. Tommy runs through the forest, the pack in close pursuit, but soon trapped at the edge of a cliff towering above the ocean. With the savage dogs closing in, he jumps off the cliff and falls to his death. Lois seeks refuge in the abandoned barn just as a storm hits the island. She lays down in one of the stalls and falls asleep, but when she wakes up, she discovers that the dogs have returned. The dogs growl menacingly before they attack Lois, killing her and eating her corpse. Meanwhile, Jerry and Cobb manage to warn Walter, Dodge, and Marge about the dogs roaming the island and bring them back to the house. But when Jerry arrives at McMinnimee's cabin to warn him, he believes something is wrong when the old man does not respond. He then discovers the dead bodies of Shazah, and the collie. After searching the side of the cabin, he finds the old man's lifeless body inside having already been attacked and mauled by the pack. Jerry then leaves Mcinnimee's cabin just managing to avoid the pack who had been stalking him. He returns to the house and tells Lois and the others of what had happened. He even states that most of the dogs were once tourists' pets, but were abandoned to survive on the island a few weeks earlier. Dodge, concerned and outraged that his son Tommy is still out lost on the island, persuades Jerry to find him. Jerry, accompanied by Dodge and Cobb, head out to the abandoned barn and find the dogs running away. Dodge, armed with a rifle, shoots and kills a dalmatian as the pack runs off. Inside the barn, the men find Lois' mangled body lying in a corner, but do not find Tommy. Dodge, believing that his son is dead, steals Jerry's jeep and drives off in pursuit of the dogs, with Jerry and Cobb following him in Cobb's truck. Dodge soon encounters the pack near one of the abandoned houses, but before he can even shoot at them, the dogs attack him and tear him to shreds. Jerry and Cobb soon find Dodge and drive off the dogs with their truck, but Dodge succumbs to his injuries and dies the next day. After failing to send a signal out to the Coast Guard on the radio, Jerry orders Millie, Walter, and Cobb to find whatever weapons they can use against the pack, but the only weapons they can find are Jerry's shotgun and a handful of cartridges, a couple of sticks, an umbrella, and a few knives. Later that same day, Jerry, his family, and the few remaining inhabitants find themselves under siege by the pack. Later that afternoon, the mongrel and four other dogs from the pack launch an attack on the house, trying to break through the windows, but Jerry, Millie, their sons, and Cobb struggle to hold them off. Two of the dogs, a Doberman Pinscher and an Irish setter, manage to break inside the house, but Jerry kills the setter with his shotgun and Walter and Jerry's dog Riley drive the Doberman out of the house. The rest of the dogs flee after failing to break through the windows and get into the house. Realizing that the dogs will return for another assault, Jerry tells his family, Marge, Cobb, and Walter to board up the windows and doors of the house. Later that night, the group carries Dodge's body down to the docks and place him in a boat, pushing it out to sea to prevent the pack from trying to get at it. Knowing that the dogs will be back, they then quickly return to the house and lock themselves inside. The following morning, Walter wakes up and hears the sound of a motorboat near the docks. He grabs Jerry's shotgun and runs down to the docks to find a small group of people in a motorboat several yards out at sea. He fires a shot in the air, trying to signal them to land at the docks, but the people believe he is threatening them and drive away. Walter turns around, only to find the dogs standing in his way. He fights them off with the gun, but the mongrel and two other dogs quickly overpower him and knock him off the deck into the water. Meanwhile, Jerry, having heard the sound of the shotgun being fired and realizing that Walter has headed down to the docks, takes his jeep and drives down there, only to find him surrounded by the pack. As Jerry drives his vehicle onto the dock, the dogs turn their attention towards Jerry and charge him. The moving jeep runs over the majority of the pack, killing a gray terrier mongrel and forcing the rest of the dogs to retreat into the forest. Jerry pulls Walter out of the water and drives him back to the house. Tired of waiting for help, Jerry orders Millie to take Marge, Riley, Walter, and their sons out to the docks, while he and Cobb would try to finish off the pack. While Cobb waits quietly in Jerry's jeep, Jerry lures the mongrel and the remainder of his pack into the house. As soon as the dogs are all inside, Cobb closes the door behind them, pours several bucketloads of gasoline on the walls, and sets the house on fire with a torch. Jerry then climbs up the ladder to the attic and tries to raise it to prevent the dogs from following him, but the mongrel leaps on top of the ladder and manages to reach the top. Jerry holds him off for a short while, but as the flames reach the floor of the attic, he pushes the dog back and jumps through a window, sliding off the roof and lands on the grass below. The mongrel leaps out of the same window and springs at Jerry, but he misses his aim and is embedded on the sharpened end of a broken pipe. Millie and the others return to the house and watch as the burning building explodes and collapses, killing all the dogs inside. They soon discover that one of the dogs, the same dog that was abandoned and had joined the pack a few days earlier, had apparently did not join the fate of his comrades because the rope he was tied to had been caught and tangled in a heavy branch. Realizing that the dog was apparently afraid and not as savage and aggressive as the other dogs, Jerry decides to try to tame it. Using some crackers, he feeds them one by one to the dog. The film ends as the dog starts licking Jerry's hand, apparently winning the trust of the man and becoming a pet again.

Bunso is about three boys named Tony , Diosel , and Bunso  who are detained in a city jail. There, they share dingy spaces with adult criminals convicted of rape, murder and drug dealing. OneWorld is an international human rights film festival. The Grand Jury honored Ditsi Carolino along with Pirjo Honkasalo for the film Three Rooms of Melancholia, an entry from Finland. In a statement by the Grand Jury, Carolino was noted for achieving ""empathy and closeness to her characters who are children held in atrocious conditions in a jail."" ""Filmed from not above or below their level, the film intermingles humor and despair as the children are allowed to speak for themselves as equals."" ""It's a miracle that we won,"" Carolino wrote in an e-mail to UNICEF. The film competed against other works with bigger production budgets. ""What is also amazing is the very strong responses from the audience. People would stay after a screening and ask how they can help."" Directed by Carolino and photographed by Nana Buxani, Bunso was shown in December 2004 on a limited screening. In November 2004, it had its offshore world premiere at the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam in the Netherlands where it was shown as part of the non-competition Reflecting Images section. Carolino and Buxani teamed up for the third time following their critically acclaimed documentary films, Minsan Lang Sila Bata  in 1996 and Riles  in 2002. Supported by the Consuelo Foundation and UNICEF, Bunso is an advocacy tool that child rights advocates are using to generate support for the passage of the Juvenile Justice Bill. Bunso is making the rounds of international film festival. It had sold-out screenings at the HotDocs Canadian International Film Festival in Toronto in April and at the DokFest International Documentary Film Festival in Munich, Germany in May."

Shiang-chyi then stops at a coffee shop for a short while. She realizes that her card is missing, so she goes back to the officer to ask if he still has it. He replies that he does not. Meanwhile, Hsiao-kang is smoking in a public bathroom stall. After he finishes, he washes his hands and leaves the restroom. He then walks up some stairs on the underpass.

Eric Wilson befriends Philip Craig who is a troublemaker who rescues Eric from a group of bullies. It is later disclosed that Philip is the victim of rape perpetrated by his older brother. Philip gets into an argument with a girl from their school who comes across the two boys loitering in a park. She criticizes them and refers to them as ""scum"" when she witnesses Philip vandalising a park sign with a Stanley knife. Philip approaches her and starts slashing at her forearms with the knife. He grabs the girl and drags her under a bridge. When Philip drops the knife, Eric picks it up, and follows them under the bridge. The girl is killed, although the film shows neither who kills her nor how. Eric  and Philip are remanded into custody. Philip dies in prison, assumed to be suicide, but Eric believes that he may have been killed by other inmates. Eric is later released from prison and is guided by rehabilitation worker Terry . Eric, shy and eager to be a good citizen again, builds up a new life under the name Jack Burridge. He finds a job, befriends his colleague Chris , falls in love with the office girl, Michelle , and rescues a little girl who would otherwise have died after a car crash. An article in a local newspaper portrays him as a hero and includes a picture of both boys in the story. Jack wants to be honest with Michelle and reveal his past, but Terry urges him not to do so because it is too dangerous. Terry is afraid that people may attack Jack because there is a reward of £20,000 for finding him. Terry argues that it is not dishonest because Eric is history and Jack is a new person. The rehabilitation worker is less satisfied with his own son.

He seems to show most of the obvious symptoms of the common cold and this is proven when, after looking at the name of the drug store he is standing outside, he looks at the paper in his hands, which is ripped, but gives details what to do about the cold virus. Satisfied that he is outside the right store, Sniffles creeps in through the letter box in the door and finds himself inside the drug store. He looks around and eventually spots the cold and flu remedies and makes his way to the shelf. He finds a bottle that claims to be a cold remedy but also has  the moniker ""Alcohol 125% proof"", which he either doesn't read or chooses to ignore. He opens the bottle, pours some of the mixture onto a handy spoon and drinks it. Now getting slight tipsy, Sniffles makes his way along the shelf and bumps into a box containing an electric razor. The razor comes out of its box and - using a buzzing noise, which can still be understood by the audience  - the razor greets Sniffles. Sniffles advises the razor that he  has a cold, before promptly sneezing. Moments later, the razor also begins to show symptoms of the common cold. Sniffles informs the razor that he  has a cold and promises to get a cold remedy. After telling the razor several times not to move anywhere he leaves and comes back with the spoon filled with  the same cold remedy he had taken some minutes before. Now both Sniffles and the razor are feeling drunk and partake in a rendition of How Dry I Am. The razor then seems to get tired and Sniffles walks away. As he does so, a heretofore hidden black cat begins to follow him. Sniffles finds a claw vending machine and makes his way inside as something has grabbed his attention. The cat finds coins in a pocket  and tries to grab Sniffles. Eventually he succeeds and Sniffles, who had been oblivious to the existence of the cat, begins to get very scared. Fortunately for Sniffles, the razor wakes up and begins to attack the cat, shaving off the cats fur. The cat runs away. Sniffles thanks the razor, sneezes again and is blown backwards, and into the claw of the vending machine. The cartoon ends with Sniffles smiling, hanging from the claw by his trousers."

Reform-minded Prince Paul has long been concerned about the plight of the common people and knows a revolution is brewing. Prince Alexei, heir to the throne, is loved by the people, but he has hemophilia and a slight fall turns out to be life-threatening. When royal physician Dr. Remezov is powerless to stop the boy's bleeding, Princess Natasha, Alexandra's lady-in-waiting and Paul's fiancee, recommends Rasputin as a healer. He convinces the frantic Empress that he has been sent by God to cure the child. Left alone with Alexei, he hypnotizes the boy and relieves his agony, but also gradually makes Alexei a slave to his will. With the influence he now wields over the relieved parents, Rasputin begins replacing those loyal to them with his own men. He is greatly aided when the head of the secret police, fearful of losing his job over his failure to prevent the assassination of a nobleman close to the Czar, turns to him for help. With police dossiers at his disposal, Rasputin is able to use blackmail to increase his power even further. Prince Paul fears that Rasputin's actions will bring about the downfall of the empire. However, even Natasha believes in Rasputin. She warns him that Paul is going to try to kill him. Paul does shoot him, but Rasputin is unharmed—he has taken the precaution of wearing a hidden metal breastplate. Nicholas forces Paul to resign his position when he admits he tried to assassinate the man. When Germany issues an ultimatum demanding that Russia cease mobilizing its army over the crisis between Austria-Hungary and Serbia, Nicholas and his advisers are divided. Rasputin convinces him to reject the ultimatum, leading to World War I. Finally, Rasputin begins to make subtle advances on Grand Duchess Maria, Alexandra's daughter. When Natasha finds out, she becomes furious and shouts that she will go to the Empress. Rasputin overpowers her and puts her in a deep trance. The Empress fortuitously enters the room at that moment, enabling Natasha to recover her wits and tell what she saw. When he is unable to shake Alexandra's faith in Natasha, Rasputin boasts of how he is now effectively Czar. In despair, the Empress sends for Paul. He assures her he knows what to do. At a big party where Rasputin is guest of honor, he recognizes the servant who has been bringing him his favorite traditional Tobolsk cakes all night—he used to work for Paul. Immediately suspicious, Rasputin has the house searched. They find Paul and Dr. Remezov. Rasputin is eager to dispatch his most implacable enemy himself; he takes Paul into the cellar at gunpoint. Once they are alone, Paul taunts Rasputin, telling him the cakes were filled with poison. He then leaps at Rasputin and beats him into unconsciousness. However, Rasputin refuses to die. Covered with blood, he rises and walks toward Paul, shouting that if he dies, Russia will die. Paul finally drags him out into the snow and throws him into the river to drown. Immediately, Alexei is freed from his hypnotic trance and hugs his mother. Nicholas is forced to exile Paul, as Rasputin's minions are still in power. But the old charlatan's last prophecy comes true, as the Czar is overthrown and shot with his entire family by the Bolsheviks.

Released as part of a prisoner exchange, she is met by Central Intelligence Agency  colleague Ted Winter . When she wonders why she has been freed , Winter informs her that the dogged persistence of her boyfriend, renowned arachnologist Michael Krause , forced the agency to act. Salt admits to Michael that she is a spy and warns him that he ""is not safe with her."" He, however, tells her he wants to spend the rest of his life with her. Two years later, on Salt's wedding anniversary, a Russian defector named Oleg Vasilyevich Orlov  arrives at the CIA. Salt interrogates him, with Winter and CIA counterintelligence agent Peabody  observing. Orlov tells her about ""Day X"", a Russian plot to destroy the United States by using English-speaking sleeper agents trained from childhood. Agent ""KA-12"" will assassinate Russian President Boris Matveyev , a reformer who has dedicated his time in office to improve relations between Russia and the United States, at the funeral of the Vice President of the United States. Orlov reveals that KA-12 is named ""Evelyn Salt"". Salt protests her innocence and insists on calling her husband to warn him, but he does not answer. Winter reluctantly agrees when Peabody decides to detain Salt, but she escapes and makes her way back to her apartment. Finding signs that Michael has been kidnapped, Salt takes her weapons and one of Michael's spiders. After evading CIA pursuit after a series of escapes, Salt travels to New York City and checks into a hotel, where she extracts venom from the spider. Salt makes her way to the church where the funeral is being held. Despite the tight security, she gets in and sets off a demolition charge during the Vice President's eulogy, causing Matveyev to fall through the floor to where Salt is waiting to complete the assassination. Peabody captures her, but she escapes on the way to custody. The media report that the Russian president is dead en route to hospital. On her way to the barge where Orlov is holed up with other KAs, Salt remembers, in a series of flashbacks, growing up in the Soviet Union, where her mentor Orlov trained her and other children to obey him absolutely and how she became the sleeper agent KA-12. Orlov tests her loyalty to him by having Michael killed in front of her. She seemingly shows no emotion. Satisfied, he then briefs her on the next part of her mission: she is to rendezvous with another sleeper agent, who will help her eliminate the President of the United States. Enraged at the death of Michael and wanting to stop the plot, Salt then kills Orlov and all the other agents there. Salt meets fellow KA agent Shnaider , who uses his cover identity as a Czech NATO liaison to get Salt, disguised as his aide, into the White House. Shnaider then launches a suicidal attack, causing the Secret Service and Winter to move the President to an underground bunker. After a series of hand-to-hand battles, Salt manages to get inside. In the main room, the president  and another man together give the activation code for the country's nuclear arsenal. Winter then grabs a weapon and kills everyone except the president, to whom he introduces himself as Nikolai Tarkovski, yet another KA sleeper agent, before knocking him out. He prepares to launch missiles at Mecca and Tehran which would kill nine million Muslims. The Islamic World would be enraged at the nuclear attacks. This would also unite 1.6 billion Sunnis and Shias together which will have severe repercussions and create a slow and painful war for the United States. Salt persuades Winter to let her into the locked down room to share the glory, but before he does, he sees television news reports that Matveyev is alive. Winter rebukes Salt for falling for Michael, instead of recruiting him, and tells her that it was he who arranged for Orlov to kidnap her husband. Salt breaks into the control room, where they fight for the nuclear football. Salt wins and aborts the strikes just in time before Peabody and Secret Service agents capture her. On the way out of the White House, while still in handcuffs, Salt manages to finally kill Winter, who survived the previous fight, by garroting him with her handcuffs. On a helicopter taking her to FBI custody, Salt tries to convince a skeptical Peabody that she saved the day. She tells him that she can hunt down the rest of the KA sleeper agents trained and planted by Orlov; she wants revenge because ""they took everything from her"". After receiving an SMS saying that Salt's fingerprints were found at the body-strewn barge, Peabody accepts she is telling the truth. He secretly uncuffs her, and she jumps into the Potomac River below and escapes into a wooded area."

They receive a call and drive to the scene of a murder. As they push their way through the crowd at the crime scene, they see Brad McCullum leaving with a coffee cup. Inside the house, the detectives find the body of Mrs. McCullum, who has just been stabbed with an antique sword. At the scene are the neighbors and chief witnesses, Mrs. and Miss Roberts. The detectives soon realize that they had just seen the murderer leaving the scene. The Robertses tell the detectives that Brad was disturbed, and had changed when he went to Peru recently. In a flashback we see Brad in Peru preparing for a kayak trip on a raging river. Back to the present time, the police have learned that Brad has taken two hostages in the house across the street. The police surround the house, and Brad's fiancée Ingrid arrives. Ingrid talks to Havenhurst about Brad's trip to Peru, saying that Brad's friends all drowned on their kayak trip, which Brad had decided at the last minute not to take part in; he later claimed that the voice of God had told him to stay behind. Several more flashbacks follow of Brad and Ingrid in Brad's bedroom, talking with Mrs. McCullum, looking at nearby houses, having dinner. Back in the present, Brad demands pizza for himself and the hostages, along with a car for transportation to Mexico. In another flashback, we see Brad in rehearsals for a Greek tragedy directed by Lee Meyers. As the pizza is delivered to Brad, Lee arrives at the scene of the crime. Lee talks with Havenhurst about Brad, and we flash back to Lee and Brad visiting Uncle Ted's ostrich farm. Brad convinces Uncle Ted to give him the antique sword which would be used in the crime. Brad uses the sword in more rehearsals for the play, in which he plays the part of a man who kills his mother, who is played by his fiancée Ingrid. Brad becomes disruptive and is eventually kicked out of the production, but still travels to Calgary with Lee and his mother to attend a performance. We see some footage of Brad at Machu Picchu, and then at a Central Asian market. A SWAT team arrives to take command of the hostage situation, and the detective talks further with Ingrid and Lee. We see a flashback to Brad and Ingrid's trip to Tijuana, after which they go to Bob Wilson Naval Hospital to ""visit the sick in general"". Brad buys several pillows at the hospital gift shop. Then Brad and Ingrid walk in Balboa Park, and Brad gives away his bag of pillows, keeping one, and leaves his basketball in a tree. Back at the crime scene, Havenhurst interviews Miss Roberts, who had witnessed the crime. In a flashback to the scene just before the murder, we see the Robertses sitting down with Brad and his mother for coffee. When Brad steps out, his mother tells Mrs. Roberts that Brad has just tried to smother her with a pillow. Brad gets his coffee cup, and then goes to his car and returns with a baseball bat and the sword. He hands the bat to Miss Roberts, saying ""Kill me, kill me before it happens"". She does nothing, and he draws the sword and holds it in front of his mother. Miss Roberts tells detective Haverhurst that Brad stabbed her, though we do not see the crime on camera. Ingrid and Lee talk to Brad, urging him to release the hostages and surrender. Ingrid realizes that Brad's hostages are his two pet flamingoes, and the SWAT team moves in and arrests Brad. As Brad is led into the car, we see shots of running ostriches. The final shot is in Balboa Park, where a young boy resembling Brad picks up the basketball."

After 14 killings in a year are followed by a night shooting and the burning of a house under construction, and the town marshall tells the town council he's not sure what can be done, the council hires Tollinger as their new ""town tamer"". The marshall deputizes Tollinger, then tells him he is on his own. Tollinger begins by warning two known gunmen to leave town. He then begins to disarm everyone in the town. Then in an unseen confrontation he kills the two gunmen he'd previously warned to leave town. A group of gunmen shoots up a poster warning of the gun ordnance at the edge of town. As they ride in, they yell that they are looking for Tollinger. Forewarned by the shots, he gets the drop on them from the loft of the town stable with a rifle. He orders them to drop their guns and they do so. One trades small talk with him while reaching for a derringer in his hat, but Tollinger shoots him. At a social event, one of the town women advises Tollinger that his job won't be finished until the dance hall girls also leave town. She criticizes them for dancing and carrying on, unaware that Tollinger is an old friend to the madam who manages them. But not all is well in their relationship. When Tollinger warns Nelly Bain that her girls also have a curfew, she replies that she knows what happens in a ""Tollinger-tamed town"". She tells him she and the girls will be moving on further west, and asks him for suggestions. She asks for the name of any town where he won't be. But there's a hidden history between the two of them, and everything isn't what it seems. Two gunmen from a large cattle spread ride into town to tell Tollinger that they've detained Jeff Castle for trying to build a house on disputed land. They appear to have set a trap, inviting Tollinger to the ranch to pick him up, where they will have the advantage. Tollinger arrests the two for carrying guns in town. Some of the town's citizens suddenly have second thoughts, worrying that others from the ranch will come in and shoot up the town. But the arrest proves a good tactical move; the other ranch hands deliver Castle into town, trading him for the two prisoners. Nelly Bain tells Tollinger something she's kept from him since he arrived in town, that their daughter had died, and Tollinger takes it badly. His patience and calm demeanor suddenly gone, he resolves to clean up the town the quick and dirty way; he burns the saloon, which is owned by Dade Holman, the cattleman who had sent the gunmen. Holman sets up a trap for Tollinger, and rides into town in a surrey to see that it works. Tollinger kills his assailant but is shot by Holman. Castle shoots Holman, and at the end Nelly and Tollinger  kiss and are reconciled."

It is an action comedy film. Subhashree portrays a girl with an extremely conservative/obsessive father. Her father just can’t tolelate any other guy looking at his daughter face to face. He can not accept anybody who tries to be friend with his daughter. He terrifies, beats everybody to protect his daughter.

In the fear of Pooja's boyfriend, her father sends her to his father-in-law's home. But at last the couples gets married and after some years they had a son. The plot of Challenge is not an original piece of work but the smart treatment does make it engaging.

Despite the theme, which could have easily spiralled into the usual Tolly ordeal of sound and fury, Raj keeps the tenor breezy with music, humour and cute romance. Somak Mukherjee’s cinematography helps do the trick for Raj. Challenge belongs to Dev. He does set hearts aflutter. He looks good, dances well and carries off the angry young man attitude with panache. And yes, he can act too. Subhashree, sweet and sassy, plays Miss Touch-me-not with poise but a little more effort would have helped her match up to her suave and spunky hero. Rajatava looks a tad different from his other villainous roles as the story prevents him from going into the routine blood-and-gore nautanki. As the funny college principal, Kharaj is loud and theatrical but he fits into the scheme of things to make you laugh. Don’t miss little Aritra pulling out some gags in a cameo.

He is shown to the parlour by Mrs Sappleton's niece, Vera , who entertains the man while he awaits the appearance of his host. Vera tells a story, the terrible tragedy of Mr Sappleton and his sons. He is told how they went out hunting in the marshes, and were lost in a fog three years earlier. Their bodies were never found but the mistress of the house insists that the French doors are left open every day until dusk, preying and hoping that one day they will return. Mrs Sappleton arrives in the room, and quite blithely references that the doors are left open in expectation of her husband and sons. Nuttell and Vera exchange a knowing look. Tea is served while Mrs Sappleton reads Framton's letter of introduction. As they sit, trying to make polite conversation, Framton notices figures emerging from the mist and heading towards the open doors.

When Mr Sappleton inquires after the guest he saw leaving in a hurry, Mrs Sappleton explains that he was visiting the country for his health but that she thought he was an odd man. Vera continues to explain his sudden departure as being caused by the dogs they had with them. She explains that he had spent a terrible night some years ago being chased by a pack of wild dogs. The film finishes with Vera giving the camera a cheeky knowing glance.

Trevor observes that there is what looks like a couple million dollars on the table, and Trevor suggests that he and Roland take some of it. Roland refuses, and Trevor shoots him twice in the chest. Trevor probably should’ve checked Roland's pulse, because much to Trevor’s surprise, he gets word that Roland is still breathing and is on the way to the hospital, so Trevor decides that he has to go to the hospital and finish the job. Roland's niece Regina Lawson , who is also a cop, visits. Roland, having seen Trevor peeking into his room, secretly takes Regina's gun out of her purse. After Regina leaves, Trevor walks in and holds a pillow over Roland's face. Roland whips out the gun and shoots Trevor twice in the chest, killing Trevor. Roland is later on the mend, and he has been released from his job via medically mandated retirement, which has him feeling depressed. Roland is a graduate of the Firearms & Explosives Training Academy, and is the Texas Training Expo Tactical Trainer of the Year. Roland also qualifies as a SWAT team trainer. An old friend named Connor Wells , who lives in San Antonio, Texas, has some security issues surrounding his daughter Nikita , in that someone has made a violent attempt to kidnap her. Connor calls Roland, who agrees to fly to Texas. In Texas, Roland is met by Detective Simon Pacheco . Because Roland has brought weapons with him on the private airplane that Connor owns, Simon warns Roland that he'll be watching him. Roland is also met by Manuelo , Connor's driver. On the way to Connor's mansion, they find Manuelo's cousin Allegra  being harassed by a pair of men. Manuelo stops the limo, and Roland beats up the two men, who say that Allegra's two brothers Enrique and Gustavo owe them money. Enrique and Gustavo arrive, and Manuelo and Roland leave. At the mansion, Roland and Connor talk. Connor tells Roland about the kidnapping attempt. Connor wants Roland to be Nikita's bodyguard. Nikita's previous bodyguard, Jorge , was killed in the kidnapping attempt. Conor thinks someone inside his organization may be an enemy. Connor tells Roland that Nikita hasn't been off the estate since the kidnapping attempt happened. Roland agrees to be Nikita's bodyguard. Roland makes sure the security at the mansion is improved. Roland escorts Nikita to a night club so she can dance with her boyfriend Mason Silver , who is a boxer. Roland points out a suspicious-looking man, and asks Manuelo who the guy is. Manuelo says that the man is Jason Cross , whom Manuelo describes as a dangerous man. In a back room, Mason snorts some coke and necks with a woman who is not Nikita. Cross walks up to Mason, saying that they need to talk. Cross wants Mason to throw his upcoming fight against Tornado Jones. Cross gives Mason some money. And Roland beats up a guy who was harassing Nikita and a friend of hers. Nikita and Mason have an argument before Nikita and Roland leave. At the mansion, Nikita, talking to Connor, is wishing Roland had knocked Mason on his ass as well. Nikita thinks Mason is getting arrogant and out-of-control. Later, Simon arrives at the mansion, looking for Roland, but Victor , a man who works for Connor, tells Simon that Roland is in town to get some medicine. Simon says ""If he becomes a problem, you and your boss will pay the price."" Simon finds Roland in town. Simon tells Roland that Connor is involved with some rough people, namely Jason Cross. They've had dealings in the past, when Connor's father ran a business. Simon believes that Cross is a violent separatist, a man who believes that whites and Mexicans shouldn't mix. Simon says he's been after Cross for years, but nobody is willing to talk about him. Simon thinks maybe he and Roland can help each other. Back at the mansion, Nikita tells Roland that she appreciates what he's doing for her. On Friday night, Nikita throws up in the parking lot after hanging out in a club. After a heartfelt talk between Roland and Nikita, they leave to go to the mansion. On the next day, Roland follows Mason to a restaurant where Mason meets with two of Cross's men. Mason tells them to tell Cross that he won't throw the fight. One of the men holds Mason while the other gets out a pair of cutters and threatens to start cutting Mason's fingers off. Mason figures out that Cross is out to kidnap Nikita. Mason says that he knows what's on Connor's land. Mason thinks he and Cross can do some business so Mason won't get killed. They all leave, and Roland follows Mason to the mansion. After Mason pulls back out of the estate with Nikita in his car, Roland follows them, using the signal from the transponder in Nikita's necklace. Mason drives to where some masked men with guns tell them to get out of the car. Nikita gets out and runs. Roland kills some of the men. One of the men grabs Nikita while Mason gets beat up. Nikita is forced into an SUV, and Roland chases them. The two men in the SUV fire at Roland, and the SUV's driver rips off Nikita's necklace and throws it out the window. A motorcycle comes up behind Roland. Roland manages to stop the SUV, and the driver gets out, taking Nikita with him. The man on the motorcycle attacks Roland, and Roland kills him by throwing a knife into his neck. Cops arrive and point guns at Roland as the driver gets away on the motorcycle with Nikita. They arrest Roland. Simon talks to Roland at the station. Connor calls the police and tells them that it was self-defense. Roland tells Simon that the kidnappers work for Cross. Simon shows Roland a picture of Tory Harris , one of Cross's lieutenants. Simon steps out of the room to take care of something he's been alerted to. Minutes later, Roland is told that he's free to go. Simon returns to his office, and is angry to see that Roland is not there. That night, Simon goes to the mansion and tells Connor that if the kidnappers contact him, to tell Simon immediately. After Simon leaves, Cross calls Connor, and Simon listens in from a car. Cross gives Connor 24 hours to give him what he wants. It seems that there is uranium on Connor's property. That's why Cross wants Connor's land, plus $5,000,000 in cash and diamonds. Cross hangs up on Connor. At a church, Roland and Manuelo meet with Allegra. Manuelo tells Roland what Victor told him about the demands. After that, Roland heads to Mason's place, where a man is standing guard outside. Roland snaps the man's neck. Inside the house, Mason is making out with a woman, and two men are playing poker. Roland kills the two men. Mason says he had no choice but to help them kidnap Nikita, and Mason admits that he let his pride get in the way by not agreeing to throw the fight, and he screwed up. Roland asks Mason where Nikita is. Mason says he doesn't know, and Roland and Manuelo take Mason with them. On the next day, they have Mason bound and gagged in a truck. Roland and Manuel go to a restaurant called Hermano's. Cross is there. He calls Connor, and tells Connor that time is running out. Cross says that Connor will see Nikita tomorrow when Cross has the property deeds. They hang up, and Cross is told that his men have found Mason in the truck outside. Cross has Harris grab Mason. Cross leaves a couple of men behind. They open fire. Roland kills one of the men, and Manuelo gets shot in the shoulder. Manuelo retreats inside the restaurant, and so does Roland. The other man follows them in, and Roland kills him. That night, Roland goes to the mansion and talks to Connor. Connor admits that he and Cross grew up together, and that Cross wants the rich deposit of uranium that's on Connor's property. Connor says he doesn't care what happens, he just wants Nikita back. Connor tells Roland about a hacienda that Cross has. Roland promises that he'll get Nikita back from Cross. Outside, Manuelo, Enrique, and Gustavo are waiting for Roland. At the Hacienda, Nikita learns the truth about Mason, who now wants Roland dead. At the mansion, Connor gets the ransom ready to drop off. Simon gets a message from Roland to be at Cross Ranch at 8pm. At Cross Ranch, Roland sees Connor's limo arriving, and then sees Nikita being held by her captors. Connor gets out of his limo, and Cross gets out of an SUV. Connor hands Cross a satchel, and Roland starts silently killing Cross's men. Connor gives Cross the money, and tells him to let Nikita go. Cross is alerted that Roland is there, and Connor whips out a gun and shoots Cross. Connor and Cross fight while Harris holds on to Nikita. Simon and a SWAT team start arriving. Simon tries to keep Connor from shooting Cross again. Roland follows Harris inside the building. After beating Harris up, Roland kills Harris. Connor gives his gun to Simon. The SWAT team takes Cross away. Mason is also loaded into a van. Nikita is reunited with Connor."

A motley group of survivors holed up in an abandoned military compound includes a young  couple, a former porn star and her sheltered teenage daughter, a born again fundamentalist preacher, a gay man, an alpha male movie producer/rancher, a couple of soldiers, one male and one female, a high roller, and the preacher's infected zombified brother, chained up in the basement. Luckily for the boyfriend of the couple, who has been bitten by a zombie, the zombies in this movie differ from those in most movies in that their bite is not infective. While their food, water, and ammunition dwindle, internal strife hampers the group's events to come up with a plan to defeat the zombies pressing in on the chain-link fence surrounding the site; one by one they begin to fall victim, both to the zombies and to each other. The survivors theorize that the zombies have actually become infected in some way by alien organisms shed by the thawing comet.

It also allegorically tells about how lack of information and education amongst the farmers, can ruin them, despite their indefatigable spirit. After, the debt-ridden neighbour Bhaskar Deshmukh commits suicide, amongst many other farmers of the region, Kisna's wife Alka  observes Kisna's aloofness and interprets that Kisna is contemplating suicide too. She asks their 6-year old son Dinu  to keep a watch on Kisna, and report any irregular behavior. Kisna is however imbued by the thoughts of the arrival of the Monsoon. During these days, Alka tries her best by preparing Puran Poli amongst other myriad efforts to keep Kisna in good spirit. However, Kisna being inherently stronger than his peer farmers, albeit aloof, is often annoyed by the overt and misplaced concern of his wife. Pawning jewelry, Kisna purchases cotton seeds from Nagpur City, intending to sow them when the rains arrive. The seeds fail to germinate, due to the late arrival of the monsoons and this is the only time in the entire movie Kisna contemplates suicide, by consuming pesticide. However, Alka sells other jewelry and purchases a fresh set of seeds, which are sowed. Due to the vagaries of the rain, Kisna is able to reap only two quintals of cotton, which is taken away by the money-lender/cotton trader, leaving Kisna's family with nothing. Meanwhile, Kisna, with his indefatigable spirit, goes to a bank in the city, takes a loan and installs a bore-well in his farm, despite the perpetual pessimism of Patil. The bore-well itself doesn't work to its potential due to the erratic power supply, typical of the hinterlands of Vidarbha. At this stage, Patil gives Kisna the idea of drawing electric power from the Electric power transmission lines.

The stepfather bribes Blue Jones , one of the asylum's orderlies, into forging the signature of the asylum's psychiatrist, Dr. Vera Gorski , to have Babydoll lobotomized so she cannot inform the authorities of the true circumstances leading to her sister's death. During her admission to the institution, Babydoll takes note of four items that she would need to attempt an escape. During her time in the asylum, Babydoll retreats into a fantasy world in which she is newly arrived in a brothel owned by Blue, whom she envisions as a mobster. She befriends four other dancers&nbsp;&ndash; Amber , Blondie , Rocket , and Rocket's sister, Sweet Pea . Dr. Gorski is envisioned as the girls' dance instructor. Blue informs Babydoll that her virginity will be sold to a client known as ""The High Roller"" . The ""High Roller"" is actually the doctor scheduled to perform the lobotomy. Gorski encourages Babydoll to perform an erotic dance, during which Babydoll further fantasizes she is in feudal Japan, meeting the Wise Man . After she expresses her desire to ""escape"", the Wise Man presents Babydoll with weapons and tells her that she would need to collect five items: a map, fire, a knife, a key, and a fifth, unrevealed item that would require ""a deep sacrifice"". She then fights three samurai giants. As her fantasy ends, she finds herself back in the brothel, her dance impressing Blue and other onlookers. Babydoll convinces her friends to prepare an escape. She plans to use her dances as a distraction while the other girls obtain the necessary tools. During her dances, she imagines adventures that mirror the escape efforts. These adventures include infiltrating a bunker protected by steampunk World War I German soldiers to gain a map ; storming an Orc-infested castle to cut two fire-producing crystals from the throat of a baby dragon ; and boarding a train and combating mechanized guards to disarm a bomb . During the last fantasy, Rocket sacrifices herself to save Sweet Pea and is killed when the bomb detonates, which is paralleled by the cook fatally stabbing Rocket while she's trying to protect her sister. Blue overhears Blondie relaying Babydoll's plan to Madam Gorski. He has Sweet Pea locked in a utility closet and confronts the other girls backstage. He shoots Amber and Blondie and attempts to rape Babydoll, but she stabs him with the kitchen knife and steals his master key. Babydoll frees Sweet Pea and the two start a fire so the institution's doors unlock. They escape into the courtyard, where they find a throng of men. Babydoll deduces that the fifth item needed for the escape is in fact herself. Despite Sweet Pea's protest, she insists on sacrificing herself by distracting the visitors, thus allowing her friend to slip away. Back in the asylum, the surgeon has just performed Babydoll's lobotomy. The surgeon is confused by Babydoll's expression and asks Dr. Gorski why she authorized the procedure. Gorski realizes that Blue has forged her signature and summons the police, who apprehend Blue as he attempts to sexually assault a lobotomized Babydoll. While being led away, Blue shouts that it is the stepfather that wanted it done. It is revealed that the events in Babydoll's dream parallel events in the hospital. At a bus station, Sweet Pea is stopped by police as she tries to get on a bus to Fort Wayne, but she is rescued by the bus driver , who misleads the police and allows her to board the bus. During the end credits, Dr. Gorski and Blue perform ""Love is the Drug"" in a musical/fantasy sequence that includes all five female leads."

The storyline begins with Arjun as a nine-year-old boy, and follows him until he grows into the warrior that the world knows him as. It explores his life with his brothers in Hastinapur, his training and education, and his ultimate discovery of the warrior within himself.. The movie begins with the young prince of Viratnagar asking a maid to tell him a story. The maid narrates him the story of Arjun. She tells him that Arjun was a student of Drona, and that he learned the art of warfare from him. He was more skilled than all the students of Drona. None of his own brothers, nor his cousins - the hundred Kaurvas - could equal him in the art. Duryodhana and the other Kaurvas despised the Pandavas, for they feared that they might usurp Duryodhana's throne. When the king Dhritrashtra grew older, the rivalry between his sons the Kaurvas and the Pandavas intensified. Twice, Duryodhana attempted to kill all the Pandavas, but failed. To avoid further conflict, Dhritrashtra proclaimed Duryodhana as the crown prince of Hastinapur, and asked Yudhisthira to be the king of a distant unkempt territory of the empire. In the meantime, Arjun won a swayamvar, and married the daughter of the King of Panchala, Draupadi. Duryodhana, who loathed the Pandavas, hatched a conspiracy with his uncle Shakuni and won all that belonged to the Pandavas in a betting game called chaupar. After losing everything, Yudhisthira betted his own brothers and Draupadi, and even himself. Draupadi was insulted in front of everyone, but Arjuna could not say anything because Yudhisthira was the king, and the king's words are the last words. The Pandavas, according to the rules of the game, had to go into exile for twelve years and an agyatavasa for one year. While all the Pandavas go one way, Arjuna travels North to do tapasya. Before leaving, Draupadi makes him promise that he will take revenge for her insult. He then leaves, and does tapasya, during which he earns a bow from the Lord Shiva. The story then shifts back to the present day Viratnagar. It is revealed that the Pandavas are spending their secret exile, or 'agyatavasa', there, and are noticed by some of the spies of Duryodhana. According to the outcome of the game, if any one of the Pandavas are found before the end of that one year, the Pandavas will have to again go for a twelve year exile. The spy informs Duryodhana that the Pandavas are in Viratnagar. So he launches an attack on Viratnagar with the help of his bandit friends. The king of Viratnagar leaves to thrash the marauding bandits. However, that is the bait. From the other direction Duryodhana's army comes, and it seems that the young prince of Viratnagar is the only one who is left to fight. Will the young prince embody all that he has learnt by the telling of the tale of Arjun?

The storyline begins with Arjun as a nine-year-old boy, and follows him until he grows into the warrior that the world knows him as. It explores his life with his brothers in Hastinapur, his training and education, and his ultimate discovery of the warrior within himself.. The movie begins with the young prince of Viratnagar asking a maid to tell him a story. The maid narrates him the story of Arjun. She tells him that Arjun was a student of Drona, and that he learned the art of warfare from him. He was more skilled than all the students of Drona. None of his own brothers, nor his cousins - the hundred Kaurvas - could equal him in the art. Duryodhana and the other Kaurvas despised the Pandavas, for they feared that they might usurp Duryodhana's throne. When the king Dhritrashtra grew older, the rivalry between his sons the Kaurvas and the Pandavas intensified. Twice, Duryodhana attempted to kill all the Pandavas, but failed. To avoid further conflict, Dhritrashtra proclaimed Duryodhana as the crown prince of Hastinapur, and asked Yudhisthira to be the king of a distant unkempt territory of the empire. In the meantime, Arjun won a swayamvar, and married the daughter of the King of Panchala, Draupadi. Duryodhana, who loathed the Pandavas, hatched a conspiracy with his uncle Shakuni and won all that belonged to the Pandavas in a betting game called chaupar. After losing everything, Yudhisthira betted his own brothers and Draupadi, and even himself. Draupadi was insulted in front of everyone, but Arjuna could not say anything because Yudhisthira was the king, and the king's words are the last words. The Pandavas, according to the rules of the game, had to go into exile for twelve years and an agyatavasa for one year. While all the Pandavas go one way, Arjuna travels North to do tapasya. Before leaving, Draupadi makes him promise that he will take revenge for her insult. He then leaves, and does tapasya, during which he earns a bow from the Lord Shiva. The story then shifts back to the present day Viratnagar. It is revealed that the Pandavas are spending their secret exile, or 'agyatavasa', there, and are noticed by some of the spies of Duryodhana. According to the outcome of the game, if any one of the Pandavas are found before the end of that one year, the Pandavas will have to again go for a twelve year exile. The spy informs Duryodhana that the Pandavas are in Viratnagar. So he launches an attack on Viratnagar with the help of his bandit friends. The king of Viratnagar leaves to thrash the marauding bandits. However, that is the bait. From the other direction Duryodhana's army comes, and it seems that the young prince of Viratnagar is the only one who is left to fight. Will the young prince embody all that he has learnt by the telling of the tale of Arjun? Will he himself rise to become a warrior and defend singlehandedly his land against the strength of the mighty Kuru Army and Duryodhan? Watch Arjun: The Warrior Prince to learn the epic conclusion.

Michiel feels resentment towards his father, the mayor, who is seemingly only interested in maintaining the status quo between the town and the German Army. He worships his Uncle Ben, an adventurer in contact with the local resistance. During the winter, Michiel's loyalties are tested. An allied plane is hit in the air and crashes, but before it hits the ground, a young British airman is able to escape by parachute. One of the villagers, Dirk, helps the airman, Jack, but Dirk is arrested. Before his arrest, Dirk gives Michiel a letter to be delivered to Bertus, the village blacksmith. Before Michiel can deliver the letter, Bertus is shot and killed by the Germans. Michiel opens the letter, which directs him to Jack's hiding place in the forest. Jack is injured, and Michiel enlists the aid of his sister Erica, a nurse, to take care of him. Jack and Erica soon develop a romantic relationship. Michiel's father is arrested when the body of a German soldier, killed by Jack on the night of the plane crash, is found in the forest. Jack wants to turn himself in to save Michiel's father, but Ben tells Michiel he can save his father. Ben's efforts fail, and Michiel's father is shot by the Germans. Michiel ties to take Jack to the town of Zwolle, across a river, but the Germans foil their attempt, and the two narrowly escape after a chase through the forest. Michiel finally turns to his Uncle Ben for help in getting Jack to Zwolle. Ben agrees, and Ben, Jack and Erica set off for the bridge to Zwolle. As they leave, Ben tells Michiel that Dirk should never have gotten Michiel involved with Jack. After they go, Michiel realizes that he had never mentioned Dirk's role to Ben. Quickly checking Ben's suitcase, he finds papers showing that Ben is working for the Germans. Rushing to the river, Michiel stops the trio, grabs Jack's pistol, and confronts Ben. While Michiel guards Ben, Jack and Erica succeed in making it across the river to Zwolle. Ben tells Michiel that he had arranged for his father to be released, but that his father refused to let another villager be shot in his place. Ben attempts to escape to a passing German patrol, but Michiel shoots and kills him. A few months later, Allied soldiers enter the village and are rapturously welcomed by the villagers. One of the soldiers brings a letter for Erica, presumably from Jack. Michiel hesitates to join in the celebrations after all that has happened, but finally joins in.

The British South Africa Company   is based in the encampment of Fort Salisbury . The film starts with a sepia toned trial of two AWOL volunteers and later deserters who were eventually court martialed by the army for stealing gold which was given to them by Matabele warriors on behalf of King Lobengula as a peace offering to end the war. In this trial  the voice of TV anchor man/journalist Adrian Steed is heard as the judge  and that of Stuart Brown playing Dr. Leander Starr Jameson. The film then cuts to a glorious sunset shot of Southern Rhodesia where the camp is situated. After a sentimental encounter between the leader Allan Wilson and his wife May in which Wilson professes the fervent wish to procreate with his wife in order to produce pioneer Rhodesians, it cuts to the titles of the film, all based on scenes from the film. The horrific and ultimately unavoidable slaughter of the Patrol is included. Fort Salisbury has a serious problem; it is surrounded by hordes of menacing Matabele warriors, one of whom demands the release of the Shona people under the protection of the BSAC and promises that his warriors will kill them in the bush and not in the Shangani River so as not to dirty the water. The BSAC re-group and under orders from Dr. Jameson, are to pursue King Lobengula’s troops all the way down from Fort Salisbury to the south of Rhodesia, at that time the kingdom of Lobengula, to capture King Lobengula and hold him to ransom. Wilson leads his troops on what has become a heroic but ultimately futile quest to capture the King in the hope that his troops will surrender. One by one, the volunteers begin showing signs of their inexperience and sometimes lack of courage. One even loses his nerve, runs away and is shot while fleeing. Eventually, with ammunition and morale running low, Wilson dispatches Burnham back to the fort to alert Major Forbes that reinforcements are required. After much argument, Burnham complies and the Shangani Patrol is minus another volunteer. Burnham alerts Major Forbes of the peril that the Patrol is in. Forbes refuses to back his troops up. The Patrol is eliminated by the Ndebele after Wilson fires his remaining bullet. He and the party are killed by the Matabele, who then praised the 34 men of the Shangani Patrol as being ""men of men"". The final slaughter of the vanquished is shown in quick fire frame flashes  and with no sound, right up until the moment when the Matabele induna screams ""Touch not their bodies! They were men of men and their fathers were men before them!"" The last scene is of Burnham visiting the burial and monument to the Shangani Patrol at Matopo Hills."

He surprises his seniors in the Army with his athletic skills. Though he was not interested in sports, he joins the sports division because there were no limits on their diet. Picked for the 5000 meters race's training, he was persuaded to run for the 3000 meter steeplechase by his coach. He participates in the Indian National Games and wins the gold medal in the steeplechase event 7 years in a row. In 1958 he participates in the Asian Games at Tokyo, but couldn't win because of his inability to adjust with the track spikes only given to him in the final event. He felt frustrated when he was not allowed to go the borders to fight in the 1962 and 1965 wars because sportsmen were not allowed to fight in them. In 1967, he participated in the International Military Games and wins the gold medal in the steeplechase. His elder brother from his native place visits him and tells about an illegal acquisition by Bhanwar Singh, his relative. Paan Singh retires from the Army to settle his family disputes, despite being offered a position as the coach in the army. On arriving home, he tries to resolve the issue with Bhanwar Singh.

She also gives them a key to go where they want, which they use to attack a GSE member in Segregation, who is only narrowly rescued by an officer, Officer Mason, who also aids the GSE. They also use this key to gain access to and punish inmates who either cross them or do not follow on with payments. The GSE realize that in order to survive, they need to stand their ground and, with the assistance of Dave, they corner and assault two of the Millwall fans. Soon after this Marc threatens Dave. Dave uses Marc's tactic against him and by beating up the Millwall fans and pretending to be the victims. Angered, Marc gains access to segregation where Dave is sleeping after being sent there and assaults him. However, after one too many Pete taunts, Dave gains the upper hand and is seen to be winning the brawl until Veronica and several police officers breaks it up. Due to lack of space, the prison Governor asks Veronica and Officer Mason to select 63 people to set free, under the circumstances that they will not damage society if let go. Veronica intentionally chooses most of the Millwall fans, even though they are mostly troublesome, but the Governor spots this. Officer Mason provides a more suitable list of which he agrees to, apart from the three members of the GSE who have been trouble since they came. Veronica then asks for three of her Millwall fans to be set free instead, but the Governor has an idea to let them compete for this prize by arranging a football match. Marc notices Dave's girlfriend at several visiting days and orders two of his friends on the outside to keep her hostage. Marc threatens Dave that he will kill his girlfriend unless he throws the match. Before the match begins, Dave informs his friend, Ivan of what is going to happen and tells him to call his friend to go over to the house and save his girlfriend. As the match begins, a gruesome fight breaks out while play is going on and Dave deliberately plays badly so Millwall can win. However, the GSE arrive at Dave's house to save his girlfriend. Ivan then gives Dave the signal that she is okay, and Dave stops throwing the game. Millwall stand no chance with West Ham outplaying them completely and Dave scoring the winning goal. After the game ends, Marc, now distressed at Dave, goes up to him and threatens him, but Dave laughs in his face. He then orders his men to kill Dave's girlfriend, only to discover that the GSE are at the other end of his phone. At that moment, he and his two friends are detained for kidnapping Dave's girlfriend and Veronica is also arrested on a charge of drugs trafficking . Officer Mason is promoted and Dave and his friends are set free. The film ends with the 3 boys out of prison and, though Dave wants to spend time with his girlfriend, the GSE have organized a party for them to celebrate, which they accept.

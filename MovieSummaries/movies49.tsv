Osmund , a young monk, has unbeknownst to his brothers fallen in love with Averill , a young girl who took sanctuary in the monastery. After the plague befalls his monastery, he believes it is no longer safe and sends her home to the forest. She asks him to join her, but he declines on account of his vows, after which she tells him she will wait for him at the edge of the forest by a marker for one week. Soon after, Osmund prays that God will give him a sign, as he wishes to leave to join her. As he is doing so, a group of soldiers enters the Church looking for a guide to a village not far from where Osmund's love Averill was to wait for him. Osmund takes this as a sign and volunteers to lead the knight Ulric  and a group of soldiers to a remote marshland village which has remained untouched by the Black Death. Their quest is to hunt down a necromancer, who is rumoured to be able to bring the dead back to life. Ulric's group consists of the experienced leader Wolfstan ([[John Lynch , Wolfstan's longtime friend Griff , torturer Dalywag , the fearless Mold ([[Johnny Harris , the mute Ivo , and the charismatic Swire . The journey is beset with harrowing pitfalls, as Griff is killed by Wolfstan after revealing he has been stricken with the plague and Ivo is slain in a battle with bandits. Upon reaching the marshes, Osmund only finds bloodied clothing and believes Averill to be dead. Ulric's envoy finds the village, an eerie utopia led by Hob  and Langiva . Not knowing who is the necromancer, Ulric tells the townsfolk he and his soldiers are simply seeking a place to rest. Seeing the church falling into disrepair from lack of use, Ulric is suspicious, but nonetheless accepts an invitation for him and his soldiers to come to dinner. Before dinner, Langiva shows Osmund Averill's body and tells him the villagers found it in the forest. Averill is pale with a wound to her head and appears to have died several days ago. During the dinner, Osmund is lured away by Langiva into the marshes, where he sees her perform a pagan ritual and Averill is brought back to life. Back at the dinner, Ulric and his men begin fading into sleep as they realize their drinks have been drugged. Ulric's band and Osmund awake bound and caged in a water-filled pit. Langiva and Hob offer freedom for those who renounce God. None do so and all boldly vie for who will be executed first. Dalywag is led out to an X-shaped cross and crucified, then disemboweled by Hob. Upon seeing this, Swire offers to renounce God and verbally does so at Hob's prompting, after which he is taken away, hooded with a bag and hanged. Langiva then frees Osmund and directs him to the hut where the resurrected Averill resides. Inside, Osmund sees his beloved Averill incoherent and stumbling, apparently mentally traumatized. Seeing what has become of her as an abomination, Osmund tearfully apologises to her and tells her he will see her again in Purgatory. He then stabs her and watches her die.{{cite news}} Osmund then returns to the cage and lays down the body of Averill. He attacks Langiva by slicing her across her cheek but is struck down and subdued. Reinvigorated, Ulric goads and jeers her that not one of his men will turn from God. In anger, Langiva has Ulric tied between two horses to be dismembered unless he renounces God. As the horses strain his limbs, Ulric reveals that he is sick with the disease, and thus will deliver the plague to these villagers. In the commotion, Langiva does not notice that the knife Osmund slashed her with had landed near the cage when he was struck down. Riveted by the spectacle of Ulric finally being torn into pieces, the villagers are caught unaware as Wolfstan and Mold cut their ropes, escape the cage, and mercilessly cut down all the villagers in revenge for the brutal murder of Ulric and their comrades. During the fight, Mold is killed by Hob, who is subsequently incapacitated by Wolfstan and placed in the device intended for transporting the necromancer. Osmund notices Langiva retreating to the swamp, so he grabs a short sword and follows her into the fog of the marsh. There, she claims to Osmund in an omnipresent voice that Averill had not been dead, but that the villagers had found her and Langiva had drugged her to appear dead, then put on the pagan ritual to ""raise"" her from the dead to convince Osmund of her power. She reveals that she uses this illusion to retain leadership of the village. Osmund returns to the village and Langiva skulks away into the marshes, leaving the viewer unsure whether Langiva was a witch and if her last speech to Osmund was another attempt to make him forsake God. Osmund is then brought home to the monastery by Wolfstan, with Hob to be delivered to the Bishop. In the aftermath, what was left of the villagers are ravaged by the plague; the ""witch"" had not protected the village, rather, the plague had not yet reached the village due to its remoteness. Wolfstan notes there have been rumors that Osmund became a soldier for God and set about hunting down, torturing, and burning women accused of being witches, in a quest to bring Langiva to justice and assuage his guilt. It is not known whether he ever found the true Langiva again or whether he simply sees Langiva in the faces of the women he executes."

The movie focuses on Annie’s struggle to draw Helen, a blind, deaf and mute girl out of her world of darkness and silence. Helen has been unable to communicate with her family except through physical temper tantrums since a childhood illness took her three senses from her at the age of 19 months old. She is allowed to eat with her hands, knock over or break anything and basically do whatever else she desires. All of this while being looked at with pity by her family. Her family loves her but they are all convinced she is a dumb, soft-brained child with the intelligence of an animal who will never learn anything. She is barely pacified with candy when she throws a tantrum and is headed toward institutionalization in a sanitarium when Annie Sullivan enters her life as Helen’s parents' last-ditch effort to avoid the inevitable. Plagued with vision problems of her own and orphaned at a young age, Annie Sullivan has the right mix of steeliness, empathy and patience to turn her young student's behavior around and teach her language. Annie’s job as Helen’s teacher is made more difficult by Helen’s imperious plantation-owner father, Captain Keller , and her overly soft-hearted mother, Kate Keller , when they doubt her authority and challenge her methods. Annie’s goal is to not just teach Helen to behave but to break through to her with the gift of communication. Using sign language and signing the letters to spell words in Helen’s open palm, Annie makes large strides toward improving Helen’s behavior. After two weeks of living alone with Helen in a small house on the Keller family plantation Annie is still unable to reach a break through with Helen when her mandated time deadline is reached. During Helen’s homecoming dinner she begins to revert to her old ways of acting. Annie takes Helen outside to refill a water pitcher she spilled during a tantrum at the pump and the long-awaited breakthrough is made. Helen makes the connection that the words Annie has been spelling in her open palm are in reality the communicative representation of those things in the physical world around her. The word “water” is the wet fluid coming out of the water pump. With this connection the doorway for communication is opened to Helen, and she can now survive and thrive in the world through the eyes and ears of others.

At this point, Nanda loses her temper and yells at Dev, threatening to call the police. Instead, her shouting attracts the attention of the boarding house’s owners, Mr Pinto  and his wife . Mr and Mrs Pinto assure Nanda that she’s misunderstood this Dev is their new lodger. Nanda is sheepish and embarrassed. But Dev forgives her readily quite apparently aimed at her, though he’s in his room and she’s in hers, watching each other only through a gap. Within a couple of days, they’re good friends. In fact, Nanda is pretty much in love with Dev. He flirts with her, is sweet to her, even goes off on a day trip into the countryside with her. Meanwhile, Dev starts working at Merry Musical Stores. His boss, I S Johar  flies off the handle when Dev turns up late on the very first day. But one day, I S Johar happens to come across a poem that Dev’s written and is so impressed that he quickly forgives Dev and all his shortcomings and prays that Dev’s poems will soon get published. Hopefully some of Dev’s subsequent fame will rub off onto Merry Musical Stores too. One evening, Dev’s sitting on a bench in a park when a passing car goes hurtling through a puddle, and Dev is liberally splashed. He calls out to the driver Kalpana ([[Kalpana  that something’s fallen off her car. Curious, she reverses, then gets out of the car to have a look around. This giving Dev an opportunity to have his revenge for the drenching he received. He’s been fiddling with a hosepipe all this while, and now turns it on her, leaving her wet and furious.Even worse, when she gets into her car and tries to start it, it won’t start. Soon, a bunch of stragglers gather around. Instead of helping her, they spend all their time ogling her and passing comments. Finally, Dev takes pity on her and offers to attend to her car; the engine kicks in immediately, and Dev takes it upon himself to drive her to back home. She makes it quite clear that she doesn’t want his help, but Dev insists, and leaves her with no option but to agree.By the time he reaches her house – having draped his coat over her wet and shivering shoulders – this mysterious lady is rather more kindly disposed towards Dev, though she doesn’t show it. However, when he’s gone and she’s changing her wet clothes, she looks fondly down at his coat… and sees his notebook of poems sticking out of the pocket. She has a look through it. Next day, I S Johar has a piece of very good news to share with Dev his book of poems has been accepted by a publisher and the first proof copies have arrived. I S Johar sends out copies to some of Merry Musical Stores’ clients. One of these is the wealthy and influential socialite Radharani ‘Simi’ . Simi receives a copy of Dev’s book of poems and is completely bowled over by them. Dev happens to come to her home to deliver a piano and tune it for her while she’s reading his book, and Dev owns up to being the poet. Then, a couple of days later, a lady resurfaces in Dev’s life: the unknown woman to whom he had lent his coat. It turns out that this woman is Kalpana ([[Kalpana , and she’s a famous actress. Her life is a whirl of men trying to flatter her, making promises of laying their hearts at her feet, and so on. Dev’s failure to even recognize her has endeared him to her. She likes his candour, and the fact that he treats her as a friend, not as an idol. She’s even buys him a new coat, which she hands over to him in the car, insisting that he should wear it in exchange for his old coat. And that isn’t the only time they meet. One day, Kalpana wheedles Dev into accompanying her for a shoot in the countryside. They have a minor mishap along the way, the car goes into a ditch, and Dev and Kalpana spend an interesting day getting to know the locals. Few days later, Simi had an invitation to a party at her home. Dev is reluctant to go, but I S Johar persuades him. Simi is vastly influential; she knows everybody worth knowing. She can give his writing career the boost it needs. Dev must go and so he does. He is an instant success. And he manages to convince both Simi and Kalpana that he is singing for her. At party Dev gets drunk so much that Simi has to drop him to his boarding house. Nanda notices Dev and helps him upstairs to his apartment. Next morning, Nanda gets angry with Dev about his drunken act the earlier night. Dev apologizes and takes Nanda to the Countryside where Nanda proposes Dev to marry her.

On returning from Gulmarg, at the hotel in Srinager, Dev finds Kalpana with sadness in her eyes, which he correctly guesses to be loneliness. Kalpana admits it to him, that, she has seen the superficiality of the life that surrounds her, and she longs for someone to truly understand her, as a person, not just a beautiful face. Even here, Dev asks her to give 4 to 7 days to answer. Returning from Srinagar, Dev is in a lot of confusion about Teen Devian and knowing fully well that he cannot marry three women in his country, a tortured and uncertain Dev finally makes his mind and decides to go with Nanda as his life-partner.

On returning from Gulmarg, at the hotel in Srinager, Dev finds Kalpana with sadness in her eyes, which he correctly guesses to be loneliness. Kalpana admits it to him, that, she has seen the superficiality of the life that surrounds her, and she longs for someone to truly understand her, as a person, not just a beautiful face.

Returning from Srinagar, Dev is in a lot of confusion about Teen Devian and knowing fully well that he cannot marry three women in his country, a tortured and uncertain Dev finally makes his mind and decides to go with Nanda as his life-partner.

At this point, Nanda loses her temper and yells at Dev, threatening to call the police. Instead, her shouting attracts the attention of the boarding house’s owners, Mr Pinto  and his wife . Mr and Mrs Pinto assure Nanda that she’s misunderstood this Dev is their new lodger. Nanda is sheepish and embarrassed. But Dev forgives her readily quite apparently aimed at her, though he’s in his room and she’s in hers, watching each other only through a gap. Within a couple of days, they’re good friends. In fact, Nanda is pretty much in love with Dev. He flirts with her, is sweet to her, even goes off on a day trip into the countryside with her. Meanwhile, Dev starts working at Merry Musical Stores. His boss, I S Johar  flies off the handle when Dev turns up late on the very first day. But one day, I S Johar happens to come across a poem that Dev’s written and is so impressed that he quickly forgives Dev and all his shortcomings and prays that Dev’s poems will soon get published. Hopefully some of Dev’s subsequent fame will rub off onto Merry Musical Stores too. One evening, Dev’s sitting on a bench in a park when a passing car goes hurtling through a puddle, and Dev is liberally splashed. He calls out to the driver Kalpana ([[Kalpana  that something’s fallen off her car. Curious, she reverses, then gets out of the car to have a look around. This giving Dev an opportunity to have his revenge for the drenching he received. He’s been fiddling with a hosepipe all this while, and now turns it on her, leaving her wet and furious.Even worse, when she gets into her car and tries to start it, it won’t start. Soon, a bunch of stragglers gather around. Instead of helping her, they spend all their time ogling her and passing comments. Finally, Dev takes pity on her and offers to attend to her car; the engine kicks in immediately, and Dev takes it upon himself to drive her to back home. She makes it quite clear that she doesn’t want his help, but Dev insists, and leaves her with no option but to agree.By the time he reaches her house – having draped his coat over her wet and shivering shoulders – this mysterious lady is rather more kindly disposed towards Dev, though she doesn’t show it. However, when he’s gone and she’s changing her wet clothes, she looks fondly down at his coat… and sees his notebook of poems sticking out of the pocket. She has a look through it. Next day, I S Johar has a piece of very good news to share with Dev his book of poems has been accepted by a publisher and the first proof copies have arrived. I S Johar sends out copies to some of Merry Musical Stores’ clients. One of these is the wealthy and influential socialite Radharani ‘Simi’ . Simi receives a copy of Dev’s book of poems and is completely bowled over by them. Dev happens to come to her home to deliver a piano and tune it for her while she’s reading his book, and Dev owns up to being the poet. Then, a couple of days later, a lady resurfaces in Dev’s life: the unknown woman to whom he had lent his coat. It turns out that this woman is Kalpana ([[Kalpana , and she’s a famous actress. Her life is a whirl of men trying to flatter her, making promises of laying their hearts at her feet, and so on. Dev’s failure to even recognize her has endeared him to her. She likes his candour, and the fact that he treats her as a friend, not as an idol. She’s even buys him a new coat, which she hands over to him in the car, insisting that he should wear it in exchange for his old coat. And that isn’t the only time they meet. One day, Kalpana wheedles Dev into accompanying her for a shoot in the countryside. They have a minor mishap along the way, the car goes into a ditch, and Dev and Kalpana spend an interesting day getting to know the locals. Few days later, Simi had an invitation to a party at her home. Dev is reluctant to go, but I S Johar persuades him. Simi is vastly influential; she knows everybody worth knowing. She can give his writing career the boost it needs. Dev must go and so he does. He is an instant success. And he manages to convince both Simi and Kalpana that he is singing for her. At party Dev gets drunk so much that Simi has to drop him to his boarding house. Nanda notices Dev and helps him upstairs to his apartment. Next morning, Nanda gets angry with Dev about his drunken act the earlier night. Dev apologizes and takes Nanda to the Countryside where Nanda proposes Dev to marry her.

In fact, Nanda is pretty much in love with Dev. He flirts with her, is sweet to her, even goes off on a day trip into the countryside with her. Meanwhile, Dev starts working at Merry Musical Stores. His boss, I S Johar  flies off the handle when Dev turns up late on the very first day. But one day, I S Johar happens to come across a poem that Dev’s written and is so impressed that he quickly forgives Dev and all his shortcomings and prays that Dev’s poems will soon get published. Hopefully some of Dev’s subsequent fame will rub off onto Merry Musical Stores too. One evening, Dev’s sitting on a bench in a park when a passing car goes hurtling through a puddle, and Dev is liberally splashed. He calls out to the driver Kalpana ([[Kalpana  that something’s fallen off her car. Curious, she reverses, then gets out of the car to have a look around. This giving Dev an opportunity to have his revenge for the drenching he received. He’s been fiddling with a hosepipe all this while, and now turns it on her, leaving her wet and furious.Even worse, when she gets into her car and tries to start it, it won’t start. Soon, a bunch of stragglers gather around. Instead of helping her, they spend all their time ogling her and passing comments. Finally, Dev takes pity on her and offers to attend to her car; the engine kicks in immediately, and Dev takes it upon himself to drive her to back home. She makes it quite clear that she doesn’t want his help, but Dev insists, and leaves her with no option but to agree.By the time he reaches her house – having draped his coat over her wet and shivering shoulders – this mysterious lady is rather more kindly disposed towards Dev, though she doesn’t show it. However, when he’s gone and she’s changing her wet clothes, she looks fondly down at his coat… and sees his notebook of poems sticking out of the pocket. She has a look through it. Next day, I S Johar has a piece of very good news to share with Dev his book of poems has been accepted by a publisher and the first proof copies have arrived. I S Johar sends out copies to some of Merry Musical Stores’ clients. One of these is the wealthy and influential socialite Radharani ‘Simi’ . Simi receives a copy of Dev’s book of poems and is completely bowled over by them. Dev happens to come to her home to deliver a piano and tune it for her while she’s reading his book, and Dev owns up to being the poet. Then, a couple of days later, a lady resurfaces in Dev’s life: the unknown woman to whom he had lent his coat. It turns out that this woman is Kalpana ([[Kalpana , and she’s a famous actress. Her life is a whirl of men trying to flatter her, making promises of laying their hearts at her feet, and so on. Dev’s failure to even recognize her has endeared him to her. She likes his candour, and the fact that he treats her as a friend, not as an idol. She’s even buys him a new coat, which she hands over to him in the car, insisting that he should wear it in exchange for his old coat. And that isn’t the only time they meet. One day, Kalpana wheedles Dev into accompanying her for a shoot in the countryside. They have a minor mishap along the way, the car goes into a ditch, and Dev and Kalpana spend an interesting day getting to know the locals. Few days later, Simi had an invitation to a party at her home. Dev is reluctant to go, but I S Johar persuades him. Simi is vastly influential; she knows everybody worth knowing. She can give his writing career the boost it needs. Dev must go and so he does. He is an instant success. And he manages to convince both Simi and Kalpana that he is singing for her. At party Dev gets drunk so much that Simi has to drop him to his boarding house. Nanda notices Dev and helps him upstairs to his apartment. Next morning, Nanda gets angry with Dev about his drunken act the earlier night. Dev apologizes and takes Nanda to the Countryside where Nanda proposes Dev to marry her. Dev asks her to wait till the right time comes. One evening genteel Simi who is eager to spend money on Dev, to further enhance his career convinces Dev to participate in a Mushaira at Srinagar which is to be aired on All India Radio. After a few days they reach Srinagar to participate in the mushaira where Dev performs perfectly. Later at night when both of them are sitting in Shikara at Dal Lake, Simi asks Dev to come to Gulmarg. There she proposes Dev to marry her but Dev asks her to give 4 to 7 days to answer. On returning from Gulmarg, at the hotel in Srinager, Dev finds Kalpana with sadness in her eyes, which he correctly guesses to be loneliness. Kalpana admits it to him, that, she has seen the superficiality of the life that surrounds her, and she longs for someone to truly understand her, as a person, not just a beautiful face. Even here, Dev asks her to give 4 to 7 days to answer. Returning from Srinagar, Dev is in a lot of confusion about Teen Devian and knowing fully well that he cannot marry three women in his country, a tortured and uncertain Dev finally makes his mind and decides to go with Nanda as his life-partner.

Jimmy has proven his men are looking for work with a classified ad, ""Combat Crew for hire; eager and willing to drop bombs"", but has had no offers in post-war America. Jimmy shows her how to avoid the cheque-cashing fees by opening an account with a bank where she is rewarded with a ceramic piggy bank, which they take to the pawn shop for some more money. Jean learns that her fiancée, Henry, is not waiting for her as expected. All she wants to do is get on the bus back home to Walla Walla. But things aren't quite that simple. The crew is summoned to juke box king  Peter Pedigrew's office. Pedigrew has private detectives following Jean and the crew. He threatens to put them to work, ending their idyllic lifestyle, unless they keep Jean with them until her fiancée Henry arrives. Pedigrew explains that his ex-wife Shirley  intends to marry Henry. But the only way Pedigrew can remain solvent is to remarry Shirley, for the third time, and stop paying her alimony. So, he wants the crew to get Henry and Jean back together. Reluctantly they agree, under duress; they take the ""Admiral"" under their wing. The gang lives free and luxuriously in an empty aircraft factory, where Jimmy is a night watchman. Eddie,  artfully makes their furniture out of aircraft parts and other war surplus. They get their meals discounted, for stale stock, or in trade, as when Mike ([[Steve Brodie  stands in for the lifeguard at a private club. Former taxi driver Ollie  drives them around in a sound truck, from a local music store. Jimmy's fast-talking even gets them a ride on a speedboat for an ocean jaunt. Jean, whom the gang has nicknamed ""The Admiral,” is amazed, then disgusted by their spending more effort thinking of ways to avoid work than being productive members of society. However, she discovers that they are living a dark secret. Jimmy feels guilty for Mike's injuries when their plane crashed during the war. Jimmy, the former head of an employment agency, will not res, until all his crewmembers have resolved things. Jimmy even takes Mike's place in a boxing match, since the injuries could kill Mike, though Jimmy has never been inside a ring in his life before. In the end, Pedigrew catches up with Shirley, Henry is waiting for Jean, and Eddie realizes he needs to go home to find out if his girlfriend will love him, even if he is poor. Finally, Pedigrew agrees to set up Mike and Ollie in business. So, that only leaves Captain Jimmy, finding he's in love with the Admiral, just as she's about to ship out.

In England, General Worden  learns of the plot through the French Resistance. He and other Allied generals are worried that if Dietrich assassinates Hitler, capable Nazi commanders will continue the war beyond 1945. Worden considers Hitler ""their best ally,"" because his incompetence as a military commander is ""paralyzing his own army."" In the meantime, Major John Reisman  is on trial for hijacking a shipment of steaks intended for high-ranking American officers, when Worden summons him and tells him that he is to again train twelve convicted US soldiers for a suicide mission: namely, to assassinate General Dietrich before he can assassinate Hitler. Reisman considers the idea of stopping Dietrich ludicrous, but Worden leaves him little choice, threatening to send him right back to trial if he does not cooperate. Reisman returns to Marston Tyne Military Prison to select a new dirty dozen, again with the help of MP Sergeant Clyde Bowren . Although he initially selects thirteen prisoners or baker's dozen. The New Dozen * Sam Sixkiller is an Native American GI who has managed to win nearly every medal going, but on the downside he's been imprisoned for numerous offences including drunk on duty and going AWOL. Sixkiller is the replacement for the character Samson Posey of the original film. * Arlen Dregors is a black soldier and former Philadelphia police detective who murdered a white lieutenant that had raped a French girl. His marksmanship skills make Reisman choose him to be the team's sniper. Dregors role as the black GI is a replacement for the character of Robert Jefferson from the first film. * Otto Deutsch is a German-born American citizen who killed a sergeant in a bar brawl because the other soldier had called him a ""fat kraut."" He had been drinking after receiving news that anti-German protesters had bombed his family's bakery, resulting in the death of his sister. Otto demands the right to ""die like an American soldier,"" a right Reisman promises him. * Louis Valentine is an embittered jazz musician who sees the world as being against him. He's also a racist bigot who regularly clashes with Dregors until they both see combat. * Robert Wright is a rapist who murdered a woman who, he claims, ""liked it."" Reisman barely contains his disdain for Wright , prompting Wright to attack Reisman. Reisman subdues the convict, putting him in his place. Wright silently vows to kill Reisman the first chance he gets. * Tommy Wells is a Southern crop duster pilot who collected 'souvenirs' from dead German soldiers. He expresses disdain at being ""caged up,"" and, much like Otto, wants nothing more than to prove his worth in battle. Despite Reisman being impressed with the former pilot's zeal, he soon works out that Wells isn't the cleverest member of the group. * Conrad E. Perkins is imprisoned for robbery from the corpses of dead American soldiers. Reisman vows to kill Perkins himself at first. Along with Wright and Valentine, Perkins is one of the main troublemakers in the dozen. * Didier Le Clair and Gary Rosen are both deserters, with Le Clair deserting from the French Army. The group is completed by GIs Anderson, Baxley, Reynolds and Sanders. Reisman and Bowren gather the selected soldiers together at a disused train station. Initially, there are thirteen of them but one volunteer is insubordinate and Reisman has him taken back to prison, bringing the number back down to twelve. He trains the group how to storm a train, assault the guards, and find and kill Dietrich. Initially they train only with wooden guns and rubber grenades but when General Worden informs Reisman that their schedule has been bumped up, Reisman gives the men real guns. There is mild strife when, during a German air raid, convict Louis Valentine  attempts to escape. However, Sixkiller and Wells capture him and beat him up, before bringing him back and explaining to Reisman he was merely sleepwalking. Dressed as elite German soldiers, Reisman and the Dozen  fly to a German-held French airfield and land, where they will take a bus. Realizing a Wehrmacht soldier who was black would give them away, Reisman has Dregors bandage his face as though wounded. However his hands are bare, and a Gestapo agent notices them and sounds an alarm, forcing the Dozen to escape in the bus. The Gestapo agent and several German soldiers pursue them. During the chase, Wright attempts to murder Reisman but instead is shot and killed by Sixkiller. The bus driver is killed, causing a crash that claims the life of Anderson. However, they manage to fend off their pursuers with grenades. Hiking through the French countryside, they find a bullet-riddled Nazi staff car and get it running, though it later breaks down. Because of the bus crash, they are behind schedule and Dietrich's train has already left. Most of the group want to scrap the mission, especially after an encounter with a German patrol that ends badly because, like the Gestapo agent at the airport, the lieutenant in command notices Dregors. Reisman however tells his men that there is a shipment of gold aboard the train, prompting them to change their minds. They agree to continue the mission. Aboard the train, Dietrich discovers that his longtime second-in-command Colonel Schmidt is suspicious of his motives. Fearing that Schmidt will out him as a traitor, Dietrich shoots and kills the other officer. The train arrives at a depot where it is met by hundreds of German troops. Arriving and taking shelter behind a stone wall, the Dozen watch in puzzlement. Reisman reveals he lied about the gold, angering his men. They wonder, then, if there is no treasure, why are there so many soldiers just to meet one general. They get their answer when a plane lands carrying none other than Hitler himself. Dregors contemplates disobeying orders and shooting Hitler instead of Dietrich. Reisman however tells him if he kills Hitler, the war will just ""go on and on."" So, Dregors follows orders and shoots Dietrich with a sniper rifle. Chaos follows as Nazi officers bundle Hitler into a car and escape, while the soldiers attack the Dozen, who, rather than flee, recklessly attack the train, believing it to indeed contain treasure. It does contain treasure of a sort: priceless paintings and Beethoven's original piano, however these items are much too large to take with them amidst all the fighting. They escape in the plane Hitler arrived in. During the run for the plane, everyone except for Reisman, Dregors, Perkins, Valentine and the pilot Wells are killed, although Dregors is shot in the stomach. During the trip back, Dregors dies from his wounds, and Reisman finds a briefcase tucked under a seat, containing top-secret intelligence information as well as a bag of jewels, which he agrees to split with the three remaining men. The plane develops engine problems as they approach England but Wells manages to land them safely.

While the ghosts at the cemetery where Casper is buried are getting ready around midnight to go off and scare people, Casper is trying to make friends with animals instead of humans. The ghosts leave the cemetery, as does Casper, who wanders off looking for friends in a couple animals. However, when Casper tries to make friends with a baby calf, it runs away, calling for its ""mama""; when the mother goes up to Casper, it runs away from the farm and over the moon. Later, Casper comes across a skunk and asks it to be friends, but it just sprays him and runs away. After cleaning himself, Casper sits on a log and ultimately cries because none of the animals want to be his friend. While Casper is sitting on the log, he catches the attention of a small fox cub who feels sorry for Casper's sorrow. Casper and the little fox quickly bond and he names the cub ""Ferdie"" and considers him to be his very best friend. Casper and Ferdie's relationship is put in tremendous jeopardy, however, while they are playing a game of Hide and Seek. While Ferdie is hiding, a hunter and two of his hunting dogs come and try to kill little Ferdie. They pursue him as fast as possible until he is out of breath and starts panting. While the hunter is firing gunshots towards Ferdie, Casper notices they are trying to kill him and flies in the hunter's direction, and demands that he leaves Ferdie alone. When the dogs and hunter see Casper, they flee in terror. Casper begins to look for Ferdie to tell him that everything is fine, however Casper finds that he's too late and Ferdie is dead, for the bullets went through Casper and killed Ferdie. Casper starts mourning because he lost ""the only friend he ever had in his whole life."" Casper returns to the cemetery where he has buried Ferdie next to his own gravestone. Casper begins mourning until he sees that Ferdie has returned as a ghost himself.

Together the two friends go to have dinner with Santi's lesbian neighbor, Judith, who in turn is receiving the visit of a Monica, a violinist. At Judith's house an attraction between Alex and Monica starts almost imperceptibly over the dinner table when Monica identifies with the character that Àlex describes at the protagonist of his next film project. The friendship between Monica and Àlex develops further when they go horseback riding. During an excursion to the nearby lakes Àlex and Monica become separated from Santi and Judith on a mountain walk, and are forced to stay overnight in a mountain shelter. The wild setting is just right for romance and clearly there is a deep connection between them, but they do not act on their feelings of talk about them, instead their friendship deepens while talking about their lives. Àlex is married with two daughters. His wife, Silvia, was his high school sweetheart. Their marriage had not been an easy road and they even had to separate for one year. Monica has recently adopted a daughter from Africa. She has settle in the last two years with a journalist in the first steady relationship of her life. Both Àlex and Santi ache to communicate but are embarrassed to do so. The usually carefree Santi has been re-evaluating his own aimless life in the face of mortality and is planning to have a child with Judith, a project that had to be postponed by Judith's recent health scare. Unable to find motivation in his self-imposed exile to finish his work, Àlex decides to return home early, and agrees to join Santi and the others on a final camping trip to the Pyrenees in a show of solidarity for their ailing friend before heading back to the city. However, when Alex and Monica become hopelessly lost after hiking on the wrong mountain on their way back to the base of the trail, the two find themselves drawn even further together by their shared misadventure. Similar to the unmotivated, 39 year old protagonist of his latest film, Alex, too, faces a daunting blank page, vacillating between the commercial demands of his profession and integrity of his creative vision, youthful liberation and middle-aged inhibition. Like Àlex’s unfinished script, their brief encounter, too, remains an unwritten fiction charged with imagined possibility and resigned regret. When Silvia, Àlex's wife, surprisingly appears at the countryside retreat with the couple two daughters, the connection between Àlex and Monica seems to have come to an abrupt ending. Monica, strolling around town, meets Alex's family. Her trip is near its end and she plans to leave the area early the next day. That morning Àlex, leaving his family still sleeping, take his car and reach Judith and his lesbian girlfriend who are driving Monica to take the train. Stopping on the road, Monica and Alex confess to each other the love that they are feeling; they kiss passionately and continued their lives separate ways.

Tweeny, hoping to win the hand of The President's daughter in marriage, presents him with a plan to remedy Klopstokia's financial woes: The President is to enter the 1932 Summer Olympics, win the weightlifting competition, and collect a large cash reward that has been offered to medalists by Tweeny's employer.

The victors declared themselves gods while the vanquished were renamed the Titans and imprisoned beneath Mount Tartarus. The Epirus Bow, a weapon of immense power, was lost on Earth during the war. In 1228 B.C., the mortal king Hyperion  of Heraklion searches for the bow, intending to use it to release the Titans to spite the gods for failing to save his family. Hyperion captures the virgin oracle Phaedra , believing that she can use her visions to find the Epirus Bow's resting place. In a small village nearby, the inhabitants prepare to flee to Mount Tartarus to avoid Hyperion's army. One inhabitant named Theseus  is a skilled warrior trained by his mentor the old man . Theseus and his mother Aethra , considered undesirables because Theseus was born from Aethra being raped, are forced to stay behind by Athenian soldiers including Lysander ([[Joseph Morgan . Theseus ably battles multiple opponents until the Athenian officer Helios  intervenes and discharges Lysander from the army for his actions. Lysander travels to Hyperion, offering his service and the village's location. Hyperion accepts, but maims Lysander for being a traitor. Hyperion's forces attack Theseus' village, murdering the villagers and Aethra, and taking Theseus captive. The old man is revealed to be Zeus ([[Luke Evans  where he meets with his fellow gods Athena , Poseidon , Ares , Apollo , and Heracles . Zeus warns them not to interfere in mortal affairs as gods where Zeus believes that until the Titans are released, they must have faith in mankind to defeat Hyperion. Theseus is enslaved alongside the thief Stavros . Phaedra, who is held captive nearby, sees a vision of Theseus. Phaedra organizes a riot, using the chaos to escape with Theseus, Stavros, and the other slaves. Theseus decides to pursue Hyperion and attempts to capture a boat, but he and his allies are overwhelmed by Hyperion's forces. Poseidon purposefully falls from Olympus into the ocean causing a tidal wave that wipes out Hyperion's men. Phaedra sees another vision of Theseus standing near a shrouded body. She determines that Theseus must return home to bury Aethra. While laying Aethra to rest, Theseus discovers the Epirus Bow embedded in nearby rock. He frees the Epirus Bow, but is attacked by Hyperion's henchman the Minotaur . Theseus kills Minotaur and uses the Bow to save his allies from being executed before collapsing from poisoned scratches inflicted by Minotaur. Phaedra tends to Theseus and later falls in love with him stripping her of the visions she deemed a curse. The group returns to Phaedra's temple while Hyperion and his forces are away at Mount Tartarus. At the temple, Stavros and Theseus are lured into an ambush and Theseus loses the Epirus Bow. Outnumbered by Hyperion's men, Ares directly intervenes to save Theseus and Athena provides the men with horses to reach Mount Tartarus. Zeus arrives and angrily kills Ares for disobeying his command. Zeus tells Theseus that he and his allies will receive no more aid from the gods and he must justify the faith Zeus has in him alone. Before leaving with Athena, Zeus tells Theseus to prove him right. The lost Epirus Bow is brought to Hyperion. Theseus, Stavros, and Phaedra travel to Mount Tartarus. Theseus tries in vain to warn Hellenics' King Cassander  of Hyperion's plans, but Cassander dismisses his talk of gods as myth, intending to negotiate peace with Hyperion. The following day, Hyperion uses the Bow to destroy Mount Tartarus' seemingly indestructible wall killing Helios. Theseus leads the Hellenic army to war against the Hyperion forces, killing Lysander. Hyperion ignores the battle and storms through to Mount Tartarus killing Cassander. Hyperion uses the Epirus Bow to breach the mountain and free the Titans before Stavros and Theseus can stop him. The force of the release knocks the mortals down. Stavros takes the Epirus Bow and kills a Titan, but is massacred by the other Titans. Zeus, Poseidon, Athena, Heracles and Apollo arrive and battle the Titans while Theseus fights Hyperion. Zeus destroys the Epirus Bow with the Warhammer of Ares. The gods prove more powerful than the Titans, but they are overwhelmed by the sheer number of Titans with all but Zeus and Poseidon being killed. Theseus kills Hyperion and Zeus collapses Mount Tartarus on the Titans before ascending to Olympus with Athena's body and Poseidon. The collapsing mountain wipes out Hyperion's men. The mortally wounded Theseus is also transported to Olympus for his sacrifice and given a place among the gods. Several years later, Theseus' story has become legend and Phaedra has given birth to Theseus' son Acamas . Acamas is met by the old man who informs the child that in the future, he too will one day fight against evil.

The victors declared themselves gods while the vanquished were renamed the Titans and imprisoned beneath Mount Tartarus. The Epirus Bow, a weapon of immense power, was lost on Earth during the war. In 1228 B.C., the mortal king Hyperion  of Heraklion searches for the bow, intending to use it to release the Titans to spite the gods for failing to save his family. Hyperion captures the virgin oracle Phaedra , believing that she can use her visions to find the Epirus Bow's resting place. In a small village nearby, the inhabitants prepare to flee to Mount Tartarus to avoid Hyperion's army. One inhabitant named Theseus  is a skilled warrior trained by his mentor the old man . Theseus and his mother Aethra , considered undesirables because Theseus was born from Aethra being raped, are forced to stay behind by Athenian soldiers including Lysander ([[Joseph Morgan . Theseus ably battles multiple opponents until the Athenian officer Helios  intervenes and discharges Lysander from the army for his actions. Lysander travels to Hyperion, offering his service and the village's location. Hyperion accepts, but maims Lysander for being a traitor. Hyperion's forces attack Theseus' village, murdering the villagers and Aethra, and taking Theseus captive. The old man is revealed to be Zeus ([[Luke Evans  where he meets with his fellow gods Athena , Poseidon , Ares , Apollo , and Heracles . Zeus warns them not to interfere in mortal affairs as gods where Zeus believes that until the Titans are released, they must have faith in mankind to defeat Hyperion. Theseus is enslaved alongside the thief Stavros . Phaedra, who is held captive nearby, sees a vision of Theseus. Phaedra organizes a riot, using the chaos to escape with Theseus, Stavros, and the other slaves. Theseus decides to pursue Hyperion and attempts to capture a boat, but he and his allies are overwhelmed by Hyperion's forces. Poseidon purposefully falls from Olympus into the ocean causing a tidal wave that wipes out Hyperion's men. Phaedra sees another vision of Theseus standing near a shrouded body. She determines that Theseus must return home to bury Aethra. While laying Aethra to rest, Theseus discovers the Epirus Bow embedded in nearby rock. He frees the Epirus Bow, but is attacked by Hyperion's henchman the Minotaur . Theseus kills Minotaur and uses the Bow to save his allies from being executed before collapsing from poisoned scratches inflicted by Minotaur. Phaedra tends to Theseus and later falls in love with him stripping her of the visions she deemed a curse. The group returns to Phaedra's temple while Hyperion and his forces are away at Mount Tartarus. At the temple, Stavros and Theseus are lured into an ambush and Theseus loses the Epirus Bow. Outnumbered by Hyperion's men, Ares directly intervenes to save Theseus and Athena provides the men with horses to reach Mount Tartarus. Zeus arrives and angrily kills Ares for disobeying his command. Zeus tells Theseus that he and his allies will receive no more aid from the gods and he must justify the faith Zeus has in him alone. Before leaving with Athena, Zeus tells Theseus to prove him right. The lost Epirus Bow is brought to Hyperion. Theseus, Stavros, and Phaedra travel to Mount Tartarus. Theseus tries in vain to warn Hellenics' King Cassander  of Hyperion's plans, but Cassander dismisses his talk of gods as myth, intending to negotiate peace with Hyperion. The following day, Hyperion uses the Bow to destroy Mount Tartarus' seemingly indestructible wall killing Helios. Theseus leads the Hellenic army to war against the Hyperion forces, killing Lysander. Hyperion ignores the battle and storms through to Mount Tartarus killing Cassander. Hyperion uses the Epirus Bow to breach the mountain and free the Titans before Stavros and Theseus can stop him. The force of the release knocks the mortals down. Stavros takes the Epirus Bow and kills a Titan, but is massacred by the other Titans. Zeus, Poseidon, Athena, Heracles and Apollo arrive and battle the Titans while Theseus fights Hyperion. Zeus destroys the Epirus Bow with the Warhammer of Ares. The gods prove more powerful than the Titans, but they are overwhelmed by the sheer number of Titans with all but Zeus and Poseidon being killed. Theseus kills Hyperion and Zeus collapses Mount Tartarus on the Titans before ascending to Olympus with Athena's body and Poseidon. The collapsing mountain wipes out Hyperion's men. The mortally wounded Theseus is also transported to Olympus for his sacrifice and given a place among the gods. Several years later, Theseus' story has become legend and Phaedra has given birth to Theseus' son Acamas . Acamas is met by the old man who informs the child that in the future, he too will one day fight against evil. Acamas sees a vision of the sky filled with gods and Titans fighting with Theseus amongst the combatants.

William Cagney , as 2nd Lt. Tom Cooper, gets the nickname “Soapy”, from his friend, 1st Lt. Richard “Dick” Wood, “Woody”.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0025424/ Tom finds out that “Ida Johnson”, the girl he’s been seeing, while Dick’s been off the base, is really Evelyn Worthington, June Collyer, Dick’s fiancée, who introduced herself, using her maid’s name, played by Hattie McDaniel, as a lark. But, it's no joke, when Dick finds the tell-tale bar of soap. The two pilots are picked to go on a dangerous mission into the stratosphere, with a balloon, to test high altitude flight; but, the friendship, and the engagement are off, before they get off the ground. The Generals keep reminding them that the equipment is more important than they are.

Broomfield then interviews Cobain's aunt Mary who helped his love for music when he was a child. This interview is followed up with several from friends and schoolteachers who knew Cobain when he was growing up before moving onto Cobain's relationship with Courtney Love. After establishing the background the film moves on to detail the accusations that Cobain was murdered. Broomfield interviews Tom Grant, a private investigator who has alleged that Love may have conspired to kill her husband, and wants the case re-opened by the Seattle Police Department. Grant was hired by Love, but thinks it was just so people would believe that she was innocent. Hank Harrison, Courtney Love's father, is interviewed, and states he also believes that Cobain may have been killed in a conspiracy organized by Love. He has written two books about Cobain's death. The film also includes interviews with Portland drug culture celeb and former stripper, Amy Squier, about her explicit and personal knowledge of Kurt and Courtney's heroin use, and an interview with punk singer and media sideshow El Duce , who claimed that Love offered him $50,000 to kill Cobain. El Duce's band The Mentors was most famous as a paid spectacle on the staged talk show Hot Seat, where El Duce appeared alongside guitarist ""Sickie Wifebeater"" in the 80's, wearing a black hood and inciting the audience by claiming to endorse rape, drugs and illegitimate children.04/07/00: Wally George: ""The Greatest Man Ever""YouTube - MENTORS on HOT SEAT part 1 In a similar vein, El Duce promoted his accusations regarding Love by appearing on The Jerry Springer Show and selling his story to The National Enquirer. El Duce claimed in the film that he knew who killed Cobain, but said he would ""let the FBI catch him"". Two days after that interview was filmed, El Duce was hit by a train and killed. The film also includes an interview with musician and friend of Cobain's Dylan Carlson, who had bought the shotgun that Cobain eventually used to kill himself with. Broomfield eventually moves away from the alleged conspiracy and the film turns into an investigation of Courtney Love's alleged suppression of free speech. Included in the film are phone calls from MTV saying that they were pulling out of financing the film , due to presumed pressure from Love. There is also an interview with journalist Victoria Clarke  about how Love and Cobain had threatened her while doing research for her book on Cobain and Nirvana. Broomfield includes clips in the film of the threats made by Cobain and Clarke details the story of Love assaulting her. The film concludes with Broomfield taking the stage at an ACLU meeting  in order to publicly question Love about her attempts to suppress free speech and the irony of her representing the ACLU.

Jane and Jake attend their son Luke's college graduation from St. John's University in New York City. After a dinner together, the two begin an affair, which continues in Santa Barbara. Jane is torn about the affair; Jake is not. While Agness has Jake scheduled for regular sessions at a fertility clinic, Jake is secretly taking medication, a side effect of which reduces his sperm count. After one of his sessions he has a lunchtime rendezvous with Jane at a hotel. Jake collapses in the hotel room and a doctor is called. The doctor speculates that the reason for Jake's distress may be the medication and says he should stop taking it. Jake and Jane's children know nothing of the affair, but Harley , who is engaged to their daughter Lauren, spots the pair and the doctor in the hotel but keeps silent. Adam  is an architect hired to remodel Jane's home. Still healing from a divorce of his own, he begins to fall in love with Jane. On the night of Luke's graduation party in Santa Barbara, Jane invites Adam to the party. She is stoned when he picks her up because she has smoked a marijuana joint that Jake had given her earlier. Later at the party, Adam also smokes joint with Jane. Jake becomes jealous observing them, but with some cajoling by Jane, he gets stoned with them as well. Agness then observes Jake and Jane dancing together and becomes suspicious of their closeness. When they leave the party, Adam asks Jane if they could have something to eat. Jane takes him to her bakery and makes him chocolate croissants. This takes hours, and they enjoy their time together. Jake and Agness separate, although it is not clear who leaves whom. Eventually by a webcam in Jane's bedroom, Adam sees Jake naked and realizes that the two have been having an affair. Adam tells Jane he cannot continue seeing her because it will only lead to heartbreak. Jane's kids also find out, and they are not happy about Mom and Dad getting together again because they are still recovering from the divorce. Jane tells them she is not getting back with Jake. Jane and Jake talk and end their affair on amicable terms. The film ends with Adam at Jane's house ready to commence the remodeling.

We are also shown the harsh conditions and level of discipline in the facility through prisoner's interactions with guards and Ryan's own experience with the warden. Later while on trash pickup detail, a fight breaks out between two inmates, and several other inmates  escape in the confusion. Kazinski and two other inmates are seen running through an orange grove and a swamp, eventually coming to a farmhouse where they enter the house and steal civilian clothes. The inmates leave the farmhouse and travel down a dirt road to a rural convenience store where Ryan steals an ice cream bar. While he is eating in the restroom, the other two escapees steal a truck and drive away, leaving Ryan behind. Ryan emerges to find them gone and is questioned by some of the locals who take a liking to him and ask him about his plans and whether he intends to keep running. One of the locals gives Ryan a ride into town. In the city, Ryan spends time listening to a street musician and talking with a parking meter. Ryan then ends up in a supermarket where he inhales nitrous oxide from whipped cream cans and observes and interacts with customers. Upon leaving the supermarket, Ryan steps on the bottle cap of one of two men who are drinking beer on the hood of a car. The men become offended and one proceeds to beat Ryan unconscious. While unconscious Ryan has a vision of a silhouetted woman against a blue sky. Ryan is recognized and awakened by three other ex-inmates, with whom he attends a party. He leaves, assuring his friends that he has a place to stay. Ryan visits his brother, who questions him as to why he ran when he only had one month left of his sentence to serve. Ryan cannot answer, and informs his brother of his plan to go to Colorado and seek his mother. Ryan's brother then reluctantly tells him to leave before he becomes too attached to him again. Ryan enters a bus station and asks for a one-way ticket to Denver. He discovers that he doesn't have the money for the ticket, and after attempting to bribe the bus station manager he is thrown out of the bus station. Ryan then hitches a ride with a lady who takes him to a doughnut shop. While she is inside, he discovers a gun in her purse, steals it, and runs away. Ryan is later approached by one of the other escapees who enlists his help in breaking into a veterinary clinic to steal drugs. The two break in, but while the other inmate steals the drugs, Ryan is distracted by the dogs in the kennels, one of which he frees and later places in the window of his brother's room. Soon after, Ryan is spotted by police. He pulls out his gun, which the police notice, and then runs. The police fire two shots, but it is never made clear if Ryan is hit. The following morning, Ryan is seen observing planes taking off and landing at a small airport. He approaches a man sitting at a table and asks if he could take him up. The man notices the gun in Ryan's hand, and we then see the plane taking off. The film ends with Ryan looking out of the window smiling.

Richie is looking for a relationship, while Sherman and Glenn are more interested in sex. After going on dates with the girls, they eventually chose three women to be in their 'film' - Marina, Laurel and Nikita. When Marina checks Richie's computer to find a dating site called Perfect for Me, he feels guilty and reveals to her that the whole thing was set up for the three men to find women. She storms out of his house and meets up with the other two girls at the empty 'casting studio'. It turns out that one of the other women isn't really an actress at all, and is investigating the three guys following complaints on the internet that the casting was a scam. The girls ask to have a first read through audition of the 'script'  and then tell the guys that they want to make the script 'sexier' and that they want to have lots of sex with the three producers to practice. The women set up a hotel room with cameras, and film Sherman and Glenn preparing to have sex with them - Richie refuses and leaves. They then send in two masculine women with whips and sex toys instead, and then the police burst in and arrest Sherman and Glenn. After a night in jail, the two go to court facing 10–15 years imprisonment and a fine of up to $250,000. The judge, Solomon Mendel, allows 24 hours for the defence to prepare evidence. Richie, stuck for ideas whilst watching a reality show Real Cops on TV, suddenly realises he can make a film from the footage of the casting that they have. He reaches the court the next morning just as a verdict has been announced, but the judge allows the evidence and finds Sherman and Glenn not guilty. In the final scenes before the credits, Richie apologises to Marina again and as her boyfriend departs he realises that she isn't leaving and they kiss. Three final quick closing scenes follow this. The first show Nikita running a casting call with men, in a project called Fresh Meat. The second shows Glenn working as the director on a Spanish-speaking set, pretending to speak Spanish to the production crew. The very final scene shows Sherman revealing to Richie that he is a sex addict; Richie doesn't believe it, and jokes that next Sherman will be starting a therapy group so he can meet female sex addicts. After a long pause Sherman replies ""That's a great idea."""

Invited by Natsuki Shinohara  to participate in the 90th birthday of her great-grandmother Sakae Jinnouchi  Kenji travels with her to Sakae's estate in Ueda. While there, Natsuki introduces Kenji as her fiancé to Sakae. Kenji meets several of Natsuki's relatives and discovers that the Jinnouchis are descendants of a samurai who challenged the Tokugawa clan in 1615. He also meets Wabisuke Jinnouchi , Natsuki's half-granduncle and a computer expert who has been living in the United States since stealing the family's fortunes 10 years ago. Kenji receives an e-mail with a mathematical code and cracks it. Love Machine, an artificial intelligence in the OZ infrastructure, uses Kenji's account and his avatar to invade the infrastructure, causing widespread damage. Kenji, Natsuki's cousin Kazuma Ikezawa  and Sakuma confront Love Machine. Love Machine defeats Kazuma's avatar King Kazma and continues to steal accounts, creating catastrophic traffic congestions and disabling electrical devices. Two of Sakae's relatives&nbsp;— Rika  and Shota Jinnouchi &nbsp;– discover Kenji's involvement. Shota arrests Kenji, but Natsuki has them return to the estate due to the ongoing traffic congestions. Recognizing the situation as akin to war, Sakae calls her associates in important positions in Japan's society and her relatives who work in emergency services. She encourages them to work their hardest to reduce the potential chaos and damage that could have occurred. Kenji is able to return control of the virtual world to the moderators and engineers. Wabisuke reveals that he created Love Machine and sold the program to the United States Armed Forces for a test run. After an argument with Sakae, Wabisuke leaves the estate. Sakae later encourages Kenji to take care of Natsuki during a Hanafuda match; and Kenji and the Jinnouchis, running to Sakae's bedside the next morning, find Sakae dead. Her youngest son Mansaku  reveals she had angina and Love Machine had deactivated her heart monitor. Kenji, Sakuma, and most of the Jinnouchis initiate a plan to defeat Love Machine using a supercomputer with ice blocks as a coolant while Natsuki and the others prepare a funeral for Sakae. Kenji, along with Sakuma and the others, capture Love Machine. However, Shota carries the ice blocks to Sakae's body causing the supercomputer to overheat; whereupon Love Machine empowers itself and assimilates King Kazma; then redirects the Arawashi Asteroid Probe onto a collision course with a nuclear power plant. At the same time, Natsuki discovers a will left by Sakae before reuniting with Kenji and the rest of the group. Natsuki has Wabisuke return home before the family reads Sakae's will, asking them to bring Wabisuke back to their lives. Realizing that Love Machine sees everything as a game, Kenji has the Jinnouchis play Koi-Koi with Love Machine in OZ's casino world, wagering their accounts in a desperate attempt to stop Love Machine. Natsuki wins several rounds, but gets distracted and nearly loses her ""winnings"". However, OZ users worldwide enter their own accounts into the wager on Natsuki's side. Natsuki critically damages Love Machine, but the artificial intelligence redirects the Arawashi towards a collision on Sakae's estate. Kenji hacks into the probe's GPS, but is unsuccessful. To circumvent Love Machine, Wabisuke disables its defenses, distracting it long enough for King Kazma to be revived and assisted by several Jinnouchi family avatars before destroying Love Machine. Kenji activates the GPS code and redirects the Arawashi away from the estate. The satellite's impact destroys the estate's entrance and causes a geyser to erupt. The Jinnouchi family, celebrating their victory as well as Sakae's birthday, has Natsuki kiss Kenji after confessing their love to each other."

As there is no agreement, Androcles King of Thebes seeks the assistance of his friend, the legendary Hercules. Hercules, now married to Deianira with a son named Hylas does not wish to leave the comfort of his family, though Hylas is keen for adventure. Androcles takes matters in his own hands by drugging and kidnapping Hercules and placing him aboard a ship manned by a disreputable collection of former slaves and criminals. The only members of the expedition Androcles can trust are his sidekick, Timoteo the dwarf and Hylas who has to hide below deck from Hercules lest he face his wrath for leaving home. Rather than being angry Hercules merely lazes away on deck without offering any assistance. When the supply of fresh water is sabotaged, the ship lands on an island to replenish their supply. The crew mutinies by attacking Androcles but Hercules turns the tide. The crew is left stranded on the island, however Hercules discovers Hylas on board. Continuing their voyage, a storm wrecks the ship with all of them separated. Hercules sees a vision of Androcles begging for his help. Coming ashore on a mist shrouded island he sees a woman held captive not only chained to a cliff, but gradually becoming a part of the rock formation. When he rescues her he has to fight Proteus a god able to change form into various creatures. Defeating Proteus, Hercules discovers the woman he rescued is Princess Ismene, daughter of Antinea, the Queen of Atlantis that is where Hercules has landed. Hercules soon discovers his son Hylas and Timoteo and bring the rescued Princess to Antinea. Though welcomed at first, Ismene discovers that she has been selected for sacrifice as a prophesy foretells that if she is not killed Atlantis and its population will be destroyed. The death of Proteus has already stripped Atlantis of its protective fog that keeps it unseen by the outside world. Ismene is recaptured and taken for execution. Antinea denies all knowledge of Androcles, however Androcles memory has been taken away and he is hidden from his friends. During a celebration Hercules discovers that children are selected and taken away from their parents for an unknown reason. Things fall into place when Hercules and his companions not only rescue Ismene but a large group of prisoners in a pit. The rescued prisoners explain that children are taken to a special stone that either transforms them either into blonde supermen or disfigures the weak ones who are placed in the pit. A priest explains that the stone is from the blood of Uranus. The power of Uranus’s stone has created Antinea an invicible army of black uniformed blonde supermen that she plans to conquer the world with.

The Church has constructed walled cities to protect mankind and developed a group of elite warriors, the Priests, to turn the tide against the vampires. The majority of the vampires were killed, while the remainder were placed in reservations. With the war over, the Clergy disbands the Priests. Outside the walled cities, some humans eke out a living, free from the totalitarian control of the Church. Priest is approached by Hicks, the sheriff of a free town. Priest learns that his brother and his wife - Priest's girlfriend before he entered the priesthood - were mortally wounded in a vamp-attack, and Priest's niece, Lucy, was kidnapped. Hicks asks for Priest's assistance in rescuing Lucy. Priest asks the Clergy to reinstate his authority, but Church leader Monsignor Orelas does not believe the vampire story and refuses. Priest leaves the city and Orelas sends three Priests and a Priestess to bring him back. Priest and Hicks arrive at Nightshade Reservation where humans called Familiars, people infected with a pathogen that makes them subservient to the vampires, live alongside a number of the surviving vampires. After a fierce battle the pair discovers that most of the vampires have taken shelter in Sola Mira, a vampire hive where Priest lost several of his comrades during a major battle in the war. Priestess joins them at Sola Mira, revealing an unrequited bond with Priest. The trio destroys a Hive Guardian vampire, then discover that the vampires have bred a new army and dug a tunnel out of the mountain towards a town called Jericho. The other three Priests have arrived at Jericho, just as night falls and an armored train arrives, unleashing hundreds of vampires upon the population. The vampires are led by a powerful and mysterious human wearing a black hat. When the three Priests reject Black Hat's offer to join him he kills them all. The next morning Priest, Priestess, and Hicks arrive in Jericho and discover the town empty and the three dead Priests. Priest realizes that the vampires have been using the trains to travel by day and attack the free towns by night, with the walled city at the end of the trainline. The Priests tells the others that factories, producing massive clouds of smoke and ash, deprive the city of sunlight, so the vamp-attack would be a slaughter. While Priestess rushes ahead to plant a bomb on the railroad tracks, Priest and Hicks board the train to rescue Lucy. Battling vampires and Familiars, the two are finally overpowered by Black Hat just as they find Lucy. Black Hat reveals that he was among the Priests who were defeated in the final wartime attack on the vampire hive at Sola Mira and that after being captured the vampire Queen gave him her blood, turning him into the first Vampire-Human hybrid. As Priest fights Black Hat, it is revealed to Lucy that Priest is her father. Priestess battles several Familiars, finally placing the explosives on her motor bike and ramming it into the train engine. The explosion kills the vampires and seemingly engulfs Black Hat in fire, while Hicks, Priest, Priestess, and Lucy are able to escape. Priest returns to the city and confronts Monsignor Orelas, telling him of the burnt train containing the vampires' bodies. He proves this by throwing a vampire head onto the floor. Orelas refuses to believe him, declaring that the war is over. Outside the city Priest meets Priestess and she reveals that the other Priests have been notified and will meet them at a rendezvous point. Priest sets off into the sunset.

Harry is late to see her before she dies because he is too scared to take the quicker underpass route, where a gang resides. After her funeral, Len confides in Harry that he is being terrorised by some youths and shows Harry an old bayonet he now carries to defend himself, citing that the police would not help him and he plans on taking justice into his own hands. The next day, Harry is visited by Detective Inspector Alice Frampton and Detective Sergeant Terence ""Terry"" Hicock, who tell him that Len had been murdered by a local gang led by Noel Winters. After Len's funeral, Harry is held at knife-point by Dean Saunders, an addict and suspect in Len's murder, whom he stabs in self defence during a brief struggle. Frampton visits Harry again the following morning and informs him that because Len was killed with his own bayonet, any charges laid could be reduced to manslaughter on the basis of self-defence. Harry decides to take matters into his own hands; he follows a drug dealer named Kenny to a squalid den where he negotiates to buy a pistol. Inside, Harry finds Kenny and his associate, Stretch are also growing cannabis and are sexually abusing a currently overdosing girl to make pornography. When Harry suggests calling an ambulance for the girl, Stretch threatens Harry, and he kills the dealers in retaliation, before burning down their den and leaving with the girl and some firearms. After leaving the girl outside a hospital, Harry captures one of Noel's gang members named Marky, who is being sexually abused by Troy Martindale, a heroin kingpin. Harry shoots and kills Martindale and captures Marky, whom he tortures into revealing some mobile phone camera footage of Len's murder, proving the gang's aggressive involvement. Harry uses Marky to bait Noel and Carl, another gang member, into a gunfight in the underpass. Carl is killed by Harry, and Marky is killed in the crossfire between Harry and Noel. After Marky is killed, Noel flees the underpass, with Harry in pursuit, before Harry collapses due to an emphysema attack. Convinced that the recent gang deaths are related to a gang war rather than Harry, Police Superintendent Childs orders a major arrest operation on the estate, which then leads to a massive riot. Harry discharges himself from hospital to pursue Noel, which results in Frampton and Hicock being in a car crash when they attempt to stop him. Harry rescues them and takes them to a nearby pub, where Frampton warns Harry that Sidney ""Sid"" Rourke, the bartender, is actually Noel's uncle. Harry discovers that Sid had been hiding Noel, but his guard drops due to his emphysema, allowing Sid to take the gun and reveal that he plans on killing Harry and the officers to protect Noel. Frampton tries to call for backup, only to be stopped midway by Noel, who is told to strangle her after Sid suffocates an unconscious Hicock. After Harry draws a revolver and shoots Noel, Sid shoots and wounds Harry, only to be shot by Frampton's backup in the form of police snipers, which had picked up on her interrupted call. At a conference held after the riot, Superintendent Childs announces that Frampton and the late Hicock will be given medals for their work and sacrifice, and denies any evidence of vigilante involvement in the entire case, saying that any such suggestions are unhelpful.

Rather than finding a dour spinster, as he expects, she is a young, attractive blonde, who finds her published theories against love and men set on their head. The unbidden thoughts and impulses even invade her subconscious, in a fascinating dream sequence. It is a battle of the sexes, and the Id and Ego, as the two clash. He tries to show her that her book is ""all rot""; while she tries to prove her theories that love is just an autonomic function, which isn't really worth it. They find that they all have a lot to learn, and forgive. It looks like sometimes the answer is ""no"", and sometimes ""yes"".

She loves him; he is only grateful to her. In a church between the Russian-German lines however, Robert marries her, so that she may obtain a British passport. Together they eventually arrive in his Oxfordshire home. Frieda meets his family - his mother, his small stepbrother Tony, Judy , the attractive widow of Robert's brother, and Aunt Eleanor , a figure in local politics and vehemently anti-German. At first the townspeople are bitterly hostile to Frieda and Robert is forced to give up his job as a schoolteacher. Gradually however, the ill will retreats, and she is accepted - though not by Eleanor. She is befriended by Judy, who, unknown to Robert, is now in love with him. As Robert settles into a new life, working with Frieda on a farm, he begins to lose his prisoner-of-war heaviness. He sees Frieda in a new light. But then they see a film dealing with the horror of Bergen-Belsen and Frieda fears their marriage will not survive its revelation of her countrymen's cruelty. But Robert clings on to what they have established between them. Suddenly an ex-German soldier appears - Frieda's brother Richard . Thinking he had been killed Frieda is initially overjoyed. He had been captured and allowed to volunteer for the Polish Army. Soon she realizes however that he has remained a Nazi at heart. His wedding present to Frieda - a swastika on a chain. In a pub he is denounced as one of the guards at a concentration camp. To Robert, in private, he admits the truth of this accusation, and even claims that Frieda had known and approved of his actions. They fight, and Robert revolts now against everything German as vile and polluted. Frieda, fearing that she has lost Robert now, attempts suicide. Just in time, Robert reaches her and the shock brings him to a realisation of what he risked losing. He perceives that his faith in her was justified. Even Nell , confesses that her sweeping anti-German bigotry was wrong :""You cannot treat human beings as though they were less than human - without becoming less than human yourself.""Daily Mail Film Award Annual 1948"

The money is now gone. They take him to headquarters. He reveals the letter came from “the Panther” and is now believed as others have had letters from the same character and Digberry meets a group of them. They all got typewritten letters demanding a thousand dollars too but unlike him they consulted the police. The group all turn out to be connected . Baritone, Enrico Lombardi looks to be a possible candidate so the Commissioner orders him brought in. Lombardi tries to force himself on Nina Politza and hits Digberry who intervenes, for bringing him into this affair. Nina is reported as sailing on a ship to Buenos Aries, as planned. Digberry receives a call and goes out. While out, the police are let into his apartment and try his typewriter to see if the “H” matches that on the Panther’s letters and if his cat’s inked paw is the same mark as on the letters. They are in both cases. Digberry returns and is taken to headquarters. Digberry now tells the Commissioner he wrote the letter to blackmail himself to cover up from his wife and five  daughters the thousand dollars he drew out of his account but refuses to say what it was for. Meanwhile a woman has been found murdered in his apartment block and next to her is a signed picture of Digberry. Investigation reveals that the dead woman, wearing a gray wig, is Nina. Digberry’s unlikely alibi is that he was waiting on a street corner as per a phone call he had received. Orders go out to pick up Nina’s ex-husband and Lombardi and the Commissioner follows up a wig lead Digberry gave him, about gray hair found from an inferior wig to the kind Digberry makes. The wig maker, Wilkins tells him it could be from a wig he made for Galloway or for Lombardi. Captain Walters  who managed Nina, offers a thousand dollar reward for the capture of her murderer. A report is given that Lombardi is out of town and no such person as Galloway or the address given the wig maker exists. Wilkins is to be at the police station next morning to see if he can recognise who bought the second gray wig from a list of suspects. Lombardi is finally caught, and has a gun with one shot fired. That night, Wilkins is shot and killed to stop him identifying a possible murderer. Digberry’s apartment is searched and a missing insurance policy found, signed over to him, worth $20,000. The murder weapon, put in one of his drawers by an unseen person is found too. Digberry returns and explains to the Commissioner that he loaned her the thousand dollars because though everyone thought she was well off, she was broke. She signed the insurance over to him as surety. She could not afford to go away as before, so got off the ship before it sailed and planned to stay in town in disguise  as the knowledge that she had no money could have hurt her career. Digberry is off to headquarters again where the Commissioner finally reveals all and the villain is taken away to jail. The name of the killer is on the ""discussion"" page. The picture was dedicated to the NYPD. Anthony Abbot the writer named one of the main characters in it after himself. The Panther never existed in any form and was just something made up by Digberry very early in the picture."

Ramabhadraiah , who has two sons of marriageable age, is searching for suitable brides. Gundamma is interested in pursuing an alliance with Ramabhadraiah’s family for her daughter Saroja and sends a word through a middleman. It happens that he used to be a good friend of Gundamma's late husband. She wants to overcome the obstacle of her elder step daughter by getting her married to a down-and-out guy so she doesn’t have to get jeered for neglecting her step daughter. Kanchu Gantaiah , Gundamma's manager and a cousin somehow wants Saroja to marry his son Bhupati  who happens to be a delinquent and is in a prison. Meanwhile, Ramabhadraiah and his sons knew about Gundamma's avarice and her treatment of her children and decide to play a game to teach her a lesson. After deciding that Lakshmi will make a suitable match for his first son Anjaneya Prasad a.k.a. Anji  and Saroja for his second son Raja , Ramabhadraiah, asks his sons to enact a drama to bring Gundamma and her overbearing daughter on track. The first son enters Gundamma's house as Anji, a street worthy servant and wins her heart instantly and even a place in her house as a helping hand. The second son Raja, with the aid of his cousin Padma , who happens to be Saroja's friend, enters as Ramabhadraiah's son, woos her, and ends up winning her heart. The servant son, with his humility and wit, wins Lakshmi's heart and asks Gundamma for Lakshmi's hand in marriage. Gundamma heeds under the impression that she will never find a more obliging and humble fool who would ever be at her behest. Anji marries Lakshmi. Meanwhile, Gundamma is impressed by the second son for Saroja and is making plans for the wedding. However, she receives a letter from Ramabhadraiah that he is no longer interested in the alliance on hearing rumours that Gundamma poisoned her husband to death. Meanwhile Saroja wants to marry Raja at all costs Gundamma obliges again after coerced by Anji that a son in law in her own house will not raise a voice and that she can relish the company of her beloved daughter even after her marriage. After Saroja’s marriage Prabhakar is fascinated by Padma and wants to marry her and Anji accommodates that by convincing Gundamma. It is not long Gundamma and Saroja realises that Raja is a drunkard and a thief and Gundamma reverses her stance for Prabhakar’s marriage with Padma, which happens though. Raja intensifies his acting as a drunkard and pretends that he is not Ramabhadraiah's real son and is a vagabond and a wanted thief. As Gundamma's problems are starting, Padma's paternal aunt Durgamma , a terror to even Gundamma enters their household. The cat fights which ensue between Gundamma' and Durgamma go out of control after a while. Raja deserts Saroja and then writes a letter to her asking her to accompany him. Saroja realises now, obliges and leaves Gundamma's house against her wishes. Gundamma is shattered with all these problems and at such a time, Gantaiah's son Bhupati, just released from prison, torments her even more. Thus Gundamma, in the absence of Prabhakar is confined to the out house of her own house by Padma's boisterous aunt and Gantaiah's prison educated son. Meanwhile, Anji also leaves the house with his wife Lakshmi. It is a sweet turn for Lakshmi when Anji places her in the bungalow of Ramabhadraiah proclaiming her to be the mistress of the house and the daughter in law of Ramabhadraiah. She forgets her lifelong misery but still holds concern for her stepmother Gundamma and Saroja. Saroja is introduced as a gardener in the same bungalow by Raja and is humiliated by Ramabhadraiah as a servant. Saroja's conceit and arrogance break thus making her a well behaved wife. Meanwhile Gundamma is transformed into a humble woman following all of life's tortures in a short span. Lakshmi visits Gundamma and seeing her in a state of despair, evicts Durgamma and Bhupati with the help of Anji and brings Gundamma along to Ramabhadraiah’s house. In the interim, Saroja leaving Ramabhadraiah’s house in insult encounters Lakshmi who reveals to her that they both are now Ramabhadraiah’s daughters-in-law and that Raja being a drunkard and thief and the events that followed were all enacted by his sons, now their husbands. Gundamma is happy to see both of them are married into a good family and continues to live on with Ramabhadraiah’s family. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0262455/

She tells a story of a close encounter incident at Nome, Alaska, in October 2000. In August 2000, Tyler's husband, Will, is mysteriously murdered one night in his sleep, leaving her to raise their two children, Ashley  and Ronnie . Tyler tapes hypnotherapy sessions with three different patients, all of whom have the same experience: every night they see a white owl staring at them through their windows. Tyler puts two of the three patients under hypnosis, and while under, both patients recount similar terrifying stories of creatures attempting to enter their homes. Tommy Fisher , her first patient to go under hypnosis, returns home, kills his family and commits suicide. After hearing the similarities in the accounts of nightly occurrences, Abbey suspects these patients may have been victims of a non-human kidnapping. There is evidence that she herself may have been abducted when an assistant of hers gives her a tape recorder, the tape plays her voice and then there is the sound of something entering her home and attacking her. The attacker speaks in an unknown language. Abbey, though, has no memory of it. Dr. Abel Campos , a psychologist from Anchorage and Tyler's colleague, is suspicious of the claims. Later, Tyler calls upon Dr. Odusami , a specialist in ancient languages who was a contact of her late husband, to identify the mysterious language that is spoken during the supposed abductions. Odusami identifies the language as Sumerian. Later, Tyler's daughter, Ashley, is abducted and Sheriff August , not believing in her abduction theory, accuses her of her daughter's disappearance and remove Ronnie from her custody. Ronnie, though, goes with them willingly, not believing the alien abduction theory either. Tyler undergoes hypnosis in an attempt to make contact with these beings and reunite with her daughter. Campos and Odusami videotape the session, and once hypnotized, it is revealed that Tyler witnessed the abduction of her daughter and also shows scenes of her own abduction, showing part of the abductors ship and it is hinted that they possibly took some human egg cells from Abbey as well. the camera scrambles, and Abbey begs to the alien that abducted Ashley to return her, the creature replies, saying that its own child was never returned to it and then calls its self the savoir, then the father and finally ends with ""i am...God"" . when the encounter ends Campos and Odusami rush over to the now unconscious Abbey and then they notice something out of camera's view, the camera scrambles again, and a volatile voice yells ""Zimabu Eter!"" which supposedly translates to ""Spirit from whom you cannot be saved"" in English. When the camera unscrambles it shows that all three of them are gone. The film cuts to an interview with Tyler in which she explains that all three were abducted during that hypnosis session and none have memory of what happened. The film returns to the aftermath of Abbey's hypnosis session. She wakes up in a hospital after breaking her neck in the abduction. There, Sheriff August reveals that Will had actually committed suicide, showing that Abbey's belief that he was murdered was merely a delusion. Later it is shown that Abbey is paralyzed, presumably due to her neck injury. The film then returns to the present interview, where the Interviewer asks Abbey how they, he and the viewers, can believe her if most of what she thought was only in her mind, Abbey tearfully tells him that she has to believe that Ashley is still alive, the interviewer ends the interview as Abbey breaks down in tears. In the film's epilogue, it states that Abbey was cleared of all charges against her, leaves Alaska for the East Coast, but still continues to search for Ashley. Campos remains a psychologist and Odusami becomes a professor at a Canadian university. Both men, as well as Sheriff August refuse to be involved with the interview, while Abbey's son Ronnie remains estranged from Abbey and still blames her for Ashley's disappearance. However, Ashley is never found. The TV host then leaves the conclusions up to the viewer. During the credits, audio recordings of people recounting UFO sightings begin to play."

Pil-seong secretly takes his wife's emergency money of ₩300,000 and tells his friend to bet it on a bull name Gomi in a bullfight. Gomi is declared as a winner, and Pil-seong's friends celebrate their victory later that night as they wait for him to arrive. Meanwhile, an escaped prisoner named Song Gi-tae intervenes in the celebration and steals Pil-seong's money. When Pil-seong finds out what has happened he confronts the criminal, but suffers a humiliating defeat. Pil-seong reports to his colleagues and his boss that he encountered the infamous Gi-tae, but none of them believed in him. In an attempt to recapture Gi-tae, Pil-seong decides to recruit his friends  and found him inside a house with his girlfriend, Kyeong-Joo. Formulating a plan, Pil-seong tells his friends to stand by the outside window of where Gi-tae was, while Pil-seong himself sneaks into the house, armed with pepper spray. Gi-tae, however, was aware of Pil-seong's presence and once escaped before the police arrived. Before leaving, Gi-tae takes out his knife, stabs Pil-seong's right hand, and warns him that the next time he'll kill him if he tries to capture him again. Suffering from public humiliation as well as being kicked out of the house by his wife , Pil-seong decides to train himself in fighting Gi-tae. When taking taekwondo lessons one day, Pil-seong learns that the upper part of the human rib cage is the vulnerable area of taking his opponents down. He later buys himself his own handgun as his own personal defense weapon. In the next encounter of Gi-tae, Pil-seong got him surrounded by keeping Kyeong-joo hostage. As he forced Gi-tae to keep moving on, Pil-seong's friends intervened, causing Gi-tae to escape once again. Pil-seong's friends begged him to give up capturing Gi-tae for his own sake, but he refuses. Meanwhile, one of Gi-tae's accomplice, Pyo Jae-seok, was arrested by Pil-seong. He confiscates Jae-seok's handphone and orders him to bring back the money that Gi-tae stole from him. Learning that Gi-tae was hiding somewhere in a fishing village, Pil-seong uses a bullhorn and asks Gi-tae to reveal himself. Realizing that Pil-seong has the money and Jaeseok's cell phone, Gi-tae calls him and tells him that he is next to the manwha shop where his family works. Holding a gasoline tank, he gives Pil-seong one hour to meet him and bring the money, or else he'll destroy the manwha shop with his family inside. Pil-seong did as he was told but also asked his colleagues and policemen to arrive in his family's manwha shop. Pil-seong arrived in a small fenced area and buried the money, before Gi-tae came. Wanting to capture Gi-tae, he non-fatally shoots him in the stomach with his handgun. He discards his handgun and takes Gi-tae's knife and asks for a fair fight. The battle then ensures as both Pil-seong and Gi-tae beat each other up to the pulp. Finally cornering Pil-seong, Gi-tae asks him for the money and threatens to kill him if he doesn't. Gi-tae finds the money and walks off. However, Pil-seong regained consciousness and eventually defeats his opponent by accurately striking him in the upper rib cage. Pil-seong is barely conscious from the fight, but is satisfied on his efforts of capturing Gi-tae. Pil-seong's colleagues later finds him in the cell sleeping with Gi-tae handcuffed. Few days later, Pil-seong and his colleagues was awarded for a higher position as officers and led a ceremonial parade to Pil-seong's daughter's school. The film ends as Pil-seong and the fellow officers gave a salute.

Upon arriving at Fort Bragg,NC he meets a motley crew of volunteers and draftees predictably all-white and from varying socio-economic backgrounds. Most notable are Rocky, the bully of the group, and Mouse,jive-talking, self-styled ""lover"" of the group, who both play important supporting roles in the film. There are also the two sargeants of the Company, the tough martinet Snr.Sgt. Benner and the more affable and pleasant but still tough Sgt. White . As a wet behind the ears, immature and naive farm-boy and bumpkin, Eddie is initially mocked by his peers for his wholesome ways and trusting manner, eventually however he earns their respect by his courage, honor, friendliness and his ability to be a good teammate and comrade despite not being the most skilled paratrooper. Drama develops when Eddie meets a doe-eyed country girl by the name of Jenny May and this provides the then necessary ""love-interest"" for the male lead and a diverting but unsatisfying, irrelevant sub-plot to the main theme of the film. Various ups and downs in the life and training of the main protagonist follow and in the end predictably everything and everyone lives happily ever after.

Two criminals Iftikhar aka Khalujan  and Razzak Hussain aka Babban  botch up a job and escape from the clutches of their boss Mushtaq , who wants to bury them alive. They land up in Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh to seek refuge in the house of Vidyadhar Verma. Instead they meet his widow Krishna, who gives them shelter and tries to seduce them to achieve her own secret goal. She proposes the kidnapping of Kamalkant Kakkar aka KK ([[Rajesh Sharma , a small businessman. The duo reluctantly agree, since they want to escape the clutches of Mushtaq. Khalujan and Babban meantime realize that they are falling for Krishna, but they do not reveal their feelings to each other. Khalujan decides to tell his feelings to Krishna but is shocked when he sees Krishna and Babban having sex. Khalujan is angry but keeps quiet. However, when the kidnapping does not go as smoothly as wanted, Khalujan and Babban start fighting. Meanwhile, Krishna tortures KK and asks him where her husband is hiding, revealing that Verma might be alive. KK finally calls Verma. Babban and Khalujan realize that Krishna was just using them. They confront her, whereupon she reveals that KK and Verma were partners in the illegal business and that Verma is still alive. The duo reach KK's factory and are shocked to find Verma. Verma's goons blindfold the duo and take them to a deserted spot. When they take out their blindfolds, Babban sees Nandu , a boy he had previously met, pointing a gun at them. Nandu leaves them alive and explains the whole story. He tells that Verma had no plans to leave his criminal life, so he faked his death in front of Krishna, so that she would think he is dead. Khalujan and Babban race back to Krishna's house, where they have left her tied to a chair. Meanwhile, Krishna succeeds in opening the tube of gas cylinder, causing a leak. Verma confronts her and she tries to kill them by igniting a lighter. Verma assaults Krishna while the duo arrives. Soon, police arrive at the scene, too.

The film opens with Pete singing an ungraceful version of ""Asleep in the Deep,"" but Mickey rings a gong signaling the end of the performance. Despite Pete's determination to finish the song, a pair of robotic hands remove him forcefully. Mickey then introduces the next act, Donald Duck. Donald first presents an apple to Mickey in an attempt to win him over prematurely. But Donald's act, a recitation of ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"", ends badly as he forgets the words. Mickey rings the gong and Donald is removed from stage. Just as Mickey is announcing the next act, a disgruntled Donald returns to take back the apple. The next act, as introduced by Mickey, are ""the two Claras: Cluck and Belle."" Clara Cluck sings a clucking version of the ""Il Bacio"" waltz by Luigi Arditi accompanied by Clarabelle Cow on piano. Although Clara struggles with the swinging microphone, the performance is the first to avoid being ""gonged."" After this Donald Duck returns to stage with a submachine gun and, holding Mickey and the audience at gunpoint, determines to complete ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"" again. But he again forgets the words, and when the audience laughs at him, he opens fire. The robotic hands grab Donald and takes him off stage in a hurry.Some released versions of the film omitted this scene which was determined too violent. The most recent release however is of the film in its original version. Mickey emerges from behind the podium and introduces the final act: Goofy and his ""50-piece band"" which turns out to be a multi-instrumental contraption/vehicle from which he can play many instruments at once. Goofy begins by playing ""In the Good Old Summer Time,"" and then ""There'll Be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight.""  But the tempo and intensity of the song is too much for the machine which eventually self-desctructs. Goofy emerges from the wreckage and humorously admits ""It busted!"" But just then Donald Duck breaks out of Goofy's bandmaster hat and very quickly recites a word perfect recitation of ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star."" As Donald finishes, the ""iris out"" effect which ends the cartoon closes on his neck. He struggles to force it open but it finally closes. This is a rare instance of a Disney cartoon breaking the fourth wall."

He is a recently divorced man who does not see his sons very often. Unbeknownst to him, he constantly crosses paths with Adrian Towers, a career woman working as a writer for the news. She is married to Steven, a man who had an abusive childhood and therefore has no desire of having children. When she announces that she is pregnant, he forces her to have an abortion. She reluctantly agrees with him, but is unable to go forward with the termination. When Steven finds out, he leaves her, and threatens to file for divorce if she decides to keep the baby. Adrian has trouble accepting that Steven leaves her and refuses to talk about it to anyone. She soon becomes acquainted with Bill. Although she likes him a lot, she is still very upset over the divorce, which will be finalized only two weeks before she goes into delivery. She accompanies Bill on a camping trip with his two sons and soon notices how much she likes kids. Although she fails to tell him about her pregnancy, they get to know each other even more. He tells her that he once was afraid to become a father, but that it changed when he first held his sons. After admitting to her that he probably never could marry again, he tries to kiss her, but she rejects him, claiming it is too soon for her. The next morning, Tommy, one of Bill's sons, is almost hit by a car. Adrian tries to save him and pushes him away, only to be hit herself. She is injured and hospitalized, and risks to suffer a miscarriage. Bill soon learns about her pregnancy and she immediately informs him about everything concerning what has happened. He is scared by this news, but continues to support her. However, he admits that he is afraid he will fall in love with her and that she will return to Steven. Later, her lawyer informs her that Steven has no desire of ever seeing his baby and wants her to sign a contract, in which he promises to support her financially, on condition that he won't be responsible for the baby. Adrian refuses to sign it, claiming that he has to see his baby before making that decision. Crushed, she finds comfort with Bill and they end up becoming a romantic couple. A few months pass by. Adrian notices Steven in a restaurant and decides to confront him, but he refuses to speak to her. Bill advices her to accept that there is no future with Steven.

After a failed audition, where she is recognized as a burlesque performer from the Gayety Theatre, her manager and fiancé Mike Hannegan suggest she writes an autobiography to project a more literate image and he hires Frederick Manly Gerard as a ghost writer. Doll Face agrees on the condition she is allowed to dedicate the book to Mike with ""For the love of Mike"". Another performer in the burlesque show, Chita Chula, remarks that if the book is a success and Doll Face leaves the show it will probably have to close down. Mike then decides to produce a Broadway show of his own with the financial aid of the performers themselves. Frederick offers to put up any money missing. Chita Chula  is sceptical she can pull it off, but Mike assures her she'll ""probably wound up being another Carmen Miranda!"", something Chita Chula perceives as an insult. Mike leaks word on the book to the press and, riding the publicity, argues the show got all the press it needs and that the book, although all but finished, needs not to be published. Doll Face, however, decides to go through with it and goes to Jamaica with Frederick for some final touch-ups. Boat engine trouble leaves them marooned on an island and when Mike finds them he breaks up with her. Without ""Doll Face"" as headliner, the Gayety Theatre struggles and Mike finally shuts it down.  Doll Face releases her book ""The Genius DeMilo"" and when Mike sees she dedicated the book to Frederick instead of him, he regrets leaving her. After Doll Face refuses to talk to Mike he sends a lawyer to stop her show in the middle of opening night since she is under contract not to appear in any show not produced by him. She agrees to meet him and he asks her forgiveness. They reunite, she tricks the producer of her show to give Mike a 25% share and co-producer credit so the show can go on.  {{Empty section}}
1624928Martin is a law school student who takes a job as a night watchman at a morgue. When a necrophiliac serial killer begins plaguing the city, Martin finds himself the target of the madman's wrath.
28237622A convicted female blackmailer is found murdered in her flat and suspicion falls on three men, all of whom the police believe may have had reason to wish her dead: struggling author Hugh Allen  who had previously been involved in a relationship with the dead woman; Allen's publisher Ronald Parker ([[Henry Kendall , who had been blackmailed out of several thousand pounds while she was in his employ, and arrogant playwright Jonathan Roach  who clearly knew the woman, but is evasive about the exact nature of their acquaintance. None of the three can provide a verifiable alibi for the time of the murder, so Inspector Thornton  decides to shadow them in the belief that sooner or later the guilty party will betray himself. Allen has fallen in love with Roche's wife Alycia , who is tired of her loveless marriage and frustrated by her overbearing, obnoxious husband, and the pair begin an affair. It transpires that Roche is suffering from a heart condition and is not expected to live much longer. He has written an episodic radio play ""The Voice of Merrill"", and agrees to Alycia's suggestion that Allen should be the narrator on the broadcasts. Alycia and Allen hatch a plot to pass the work off as Allen's in an attempt to boost his career. Going further Alycia then decides to poison Roche in such a manner as to pass undetected as murder, trusting that his death will be attributed to his medical condition and will not arouse suspicion. Roche dies, and Alycia is horrified to be informed that an autopsy will be necessary. Allen tells her that he will confess to the murder rather than see her charged, and she attempts to dissuade him. However the autopsy results come back clear &ndash; Roche did not die from poison, and the couple believe that they are off the hook. Unbeknownst to Alycia and Allen however, prior to his death Roche had discovered what was going on. Knowing that Parker is in severe financial trouble and bribing him with a large amount of cash, he has set up an elaborate posthumous revenge on the couple. Meanwhile, as the episodes of ""The Voice of Merrill"" are broadcast, Thornton begins to suspect that the storyline is pointing him in the direction of the blackmailer's killer.
3112223The film begins with the crew of a spaceship seeing explosions in space and asteroids flying by. They are afraid that they are going to be hit, but their ship's computer, named Wiz, tells them that they were seeing the ""refraction"" of an event that took place millions of years ago. Overjoyed, the ship's crew hug and kiss each other. Next follows a scene within the Orion space complex  of Captain Mike Hamilton's slapping a fellow officer. Soon he is called to report on this behavior to the base commander. He says that the other officer did not give him a command personally, but told him to follow the directions of a computer. Hamilton's attitude against such machines is one of the few themes of the story. A scene derived from 2001: A Space Odyssey next appears. Hamilton and his ship, the MK-31, are sent to repair an automated satellite. One of the crew floats over to the satellite and starts work. Viewing this on the screen, Hamilton is upset because it is required that spacewalkers work in teams of two, and predicts that the acid in the battery will eat through the astronaut's suit. The astronaut says that he's in control of the situation - but it does start to eat through his suit. Hamilton himself goes to rescue the continually screaming astronaut, whose life is saved. Next comes a scene derived from Barbarella. A couple of astronauts wish to be intimate so they recline on separate beds while a light show machine plays between them. The blue orb that separates them has the same geometric shape as the Death Star in the Star Wars series. Normally this would appear to be an homage, but this film came out the same year as Star Wars . This scene is intercut with a scene of Hamilton telling a female crewmember that he doesn't like this mechanized intimacy and kisses her. The scene ends with her telling him that the old-fashioned way was better. Even though the crew of the MK-31 are only one day's travel from their shore leave on Earth, they are apparently the nearest ship to investigate an unstable planet. Once there, two flying saucers are seen orbiting it. The sensors of the ship state that these alien machines have ""disintegrators"" and Hamilton commands that they be destroyed - but they strike first and the MK-31 starts to spin quickly. Eventually Hamilton gets the ship's engines to counteract the spin and the ship lands on the planet. There's an architectural portal on this desert planet which teleports people who walk through it underground. The first man through it, and a woman who wanders away later, get attacked, but the main body of explorers meet a race of green people who have pointed ears. Their elder says that they are under the control of an evil computer. The astronauts pledge to help the inhabitants of the planet escape their enslavement and succeed in destroying the computer. Hamilton dislikes the computer always taunting the crew by ending his commands to them with the vocative, ""earthlings."" Unfortunately, the ensuing explosion takes out the planet as well. The spaceship crew and one surviving alien set off for Earth only to face further difficulties when a human member of the crew is possessed by the computer and goes on a killing spree. The alien eventually manages to subdue him, heroically sacrificing his own life. Although the crew are pleased at returning to Earth, the voice of the computer Wiz changes to that of the planet's computer, who ends the movie with the word ""earthlings."

She has no luck in becoming pregnant, however, and this leads to an estrangement from her husband. On his latest flight, Greg, a professional pilot, finds out about a bomb threat. The person carrying the bomb supposedly wants to kill another passenger, a politician with an outspoken opinion on abortion. Unbeknownst to the killer, the politician has already left the plane because it had an hour and a half delay. Greg decides to make a sudden landing in Dayton, Ohio, but during the heavy weather, the plane crashes, killing almost all people on board. Soon, the CIA, FBI and NTSB are on the place of the accident. There are different kind of speculations about the cause of the crash, and some suspect Greg of denying to follow orders. The FBI notices that the CIA immediately collected stuff out of the wrecks and told it was top secret. Diane is devastated when she hears the news, until she finds out that Greg is one of the few survivors. She is contacted by Scott Cody, a person working for the ALPA. He announces to her that Greg is the prime suspect of the crash and collects information on her, finding out that Greg was on medicine.

Arthur then prepares to see the Minimoys again to celebrate when his father, concerned for his safety due to bees, decides to take him and his mother back to the city early. However, a spider delivers to Arthur a grain of rice with the message ""help"", which he believes must have come from the Minimoys, and makes it even more important for him to visit them. At a gas station Arthur escapes from the car and returns to his grandparents' house, switching places with the dog Alfred. However, Bogo Matassalai's attempt to transform him using a telescope fails due to clouds covering the full moon and has Arthur ask them to apply an older, more dangerous alternative method, even though it may kill him. They agree. Arthur is wound into vines which are then pulled more and more tight. The procedure is successful and Arthur is transported downward in a drop of sap from the squeezed vines landing through the roof of Max's bar. Max explains to him what has happened since the last adventure and agrees to take him investigate the matter. While en route to get information on the Mimoys' current condition, Arthur and Max found out Betameche being arrested. Max creates a diversion while Arthur saves Beta stealing Max's ladybug and escaping the guards, with Arthur learning Beta was not the one who needed his help. Beta takes him to the King, only to learn that Selenia was distraught that he did not arrive and missing. However, Selenia is revealed to be held hostage by Maltazard as he uses her to enter the city. The villain reveals that since the Necropolis being flooded, Maltazard ended up in the grandparents' house where he is inspired to take over the human world by taking advantage of the telescope. However, when Arthur's dad almost ruined the scheme, Maltazard sent the message to lure Arthur and is able to capture Selenia to force the Mininoys to allow him to leave. Though they manage to get Maltazard out of their kingdom with the telescope, they unknowingly enlarged him to human size as he intended. Furthermore, the telescope itself is destroyed in the process with Arthur trapped in his Minimoy size."

They also come to know about the upcoming marriage of Jeeva's sister when Pey Babu, under the guise of delivering a Pamphlet, takes a good look at Jeeva's family. Pey Babu assumes that Jeeva's family has to venture outside their home for wedding arrangements. The gang follows Jeeva's family to a wedding card shop where the gang hears the owner of the shop asking Jeeva and his father to come back in a couple of days to collect the printed cards. Now that Pey Babu knows the exact location and time of where Jeeva's father is going to be, he comes up with a detailed plan for murder. When Jeeva and his father return to the shop after two days, the gang starts a commotion in the crowded street and in the ensuing confusion, one of the gang stabs Jeeva's father with a Poisoned Glass SHRAPNEL. During the murder Jeeva notices and identifies one of the Gang members as he looked like the same person that his father described during the previous investigation of the girl's Murder. The death of his father shatters Jeeva. The investigation of his father's murder brings the police to Jeeva's home where they ask him whether he had seen any suspicious person in his neighborhood in the days before his father's murder. Jeeva denies seeing any suspicious person although he later reveals to his friend that he indeed has seen a strange guy delivering pamphlets to his home and the guy during his father's murder. When his friend inquires why he did not say anything to the Police, Jeeva replies the guys do not deserve a police investigation and court trial. The heinous crime they committed, hacking a girl into pieces, deserves much harsher punishment. And he says that he is going to personally punish the gang not because they killed his father but because of the heinous and psychopathic nature of their crimes. He sets out on a mission to identify the culprits and goes running around the town baying for their blood. Jeeva seeks the help of his friend Kaasimedu Kutti Nadesan, a chennai gangster, who Jeeva got acquainted with in the past. Nadesan with his influence asks his gang to bring all the Guys who plans for murder in Chennai, so that Jeeva can identify him. It turns out there are only four people who can plan for murder in Chennai including Pey Babu. Nadesan interrogates the first person in front of Jeeva. The next is Pey Babu, but Jeeva gets distracted, but turns back just in time to look at Pey Babu and identifies him as the person who delivered Pamphlets to his home days before his dad's murder. Now a chase ensues and Jeeva successfully captures and subdues Pey. Now Jeeva coerces Pey into taking him to where the Teenage gang is. Both Pey and Jeeva goes to the road in front of the college where the five teenagers study. But before he can get hold of them, the gangs gets alerted and start a commotion by throwing cool drink bottles in the crowd. In the ensuing melee, Pey gets stabbed by one of the gang and Jeeva gets a clear look at the guy who stabbed Pey. So Jeeva chases him and beats him senseless . But the teenager gets killed by a train when he tries to escape the clutches of Jeeva. Jeeva subsequently goes to the dead teenager's funeral hoping that his friends will come there. The gang arrives but sees Jeeva before he sees them . They leave the funeral and to get drunk goes to one of the beaches which coincidentally is the same place Nadesan returns back after going to the sea. The gang argues among themselves how their friend got killed by Jeeva and how they should avenge him. At the same time Jeeva calls Nadesan on his cell phone to use his influence to investigate about the friends of the Dead teenager. The gang while arguing starts shouting which distracts Nadesan and looking at them Nadesan asks Jeeva about the how the gang looks like. Sensing that Jeeva's description matches the gang on the beach, Nadesan goes to inquire them while giving the phone to another one of his group to give Jeeva, the directions to the beach. During the inquiry Nadesan confirms the Killers and the gang on the beach are the same but before he can do anything the gang clubs one of Nadesan's group and runs into a nearby area with dilapidated houses. Nadesan and two of his group grabs weapons and goes after them but they are killed easily as they are outnumbered by the four teenagers who hide and attack and finish them off one by one. Jeeva arrives just a few minutes late to see that Nadesan and his group slaughtered. Now it is up to Jeeva to face four guys armed with blades and avenge his father's death. What follows is an intense, gut wrenching fight for survival between the gang and Jeeva. After a struggle Jeeva triumphs over the four rapists and buries them alive on the beach.

Carver ties Naomi to both ends of the rack and turns the wheel, hurting her. Carver claims that her punishment this time is for having a cell phone, which was against the father's wishes. After begging her father to let her go, Carver unties her, but warns her that the next time she has a cellphone in the house, her punishment is not going to be slow and painful. As she gets released, she runs off upstairs, strangely screaming: ""I can run faster than you!"" over and over again. The next afternoon, Carver comes downstairs into the dining room to be questioned by his wife Lisbeth  about what he did to Naomi the previous night. They then encourage Carver's half brother Peter , who is mentally retarded, to have lunch with them, where Carver tells Peter that the lamb that they're eating was Sophia, who Peter had grown an affection with. When Naomi comes downstairs and finds out what's up, she gives her toy animal of a horse to him, which appears to cheer him up. Later, Lisbeth takes a tray of food upstairs to her father, who throughout the entire film has his face not seen. Lisbeth then continues to read Edgar Allan Poe's ""From Childhood's Hour"" to him. Afterward, she alerts him that his guardian angels are in the room to protect him, which are shown to be small little creatures with big skull heads. Lisbeth then goes to check on Naomi and Naomi tells her that she wants to go away to college because she wants to be able to get out and meet people and do exciting things. Lisbeth, however, tells her the story of Naomi's grandmother, who ran away when Lisbeth was a baby to go see the circus and never came back. When Lisbeth then became a teenager, the circus came back into town and when she went to see it, she saw her mom in the circus act performing acrobatics on a wire. The moral is, that if Naomi leaves, she might never come back to see her father and mother just like her grandmother did. Lisbeth suddenly finds an iPod underneath Naomi's pillow. But after finding out how useful it can be, she allows Naomi to keep it unless she doesn't have her father see it. The next morning, Claudia , the Arkoffs' maid, opens the two double doors that lead outside of the castle to be greeted by three people: Kimi , L.J.  and Jensen , who claim that they are Hollywood Producers looking for a place to shoot a couple scenes for a spy/war movie they're doing. Before shutting the door in their faces, Naomi quickly invites them in so she can finally meet new people, but the opportunity is ruined when Carver comes outside and insults the trio, forcing them to leave, not before Kimi hands Carver her card in case anyone changes their mind. Carver then tears up the card, and throws it down, telling Uncle Peter to escort the trio out. Meanwhile, Naomi gathers up the card. Later on that day, Naomi sneaks a cell phone away from one of the water delivery boys and calls the number on the card so they can come over for dinner that night. That night, after finally calming her father down about having guests over, everyone finally settles down for a lovely meal until they hear something. The family explains that it's the ""protectors"" A.K.A.: Grandpa's Guardian Angels. Lisbeth explains that the Romans used to bury the dead in underground catacombs, and it is believed that a couple of tombs are buried beneath the castle. Back when the Ostrogoths and the Vandals sacked Rome, they violated the catacombs searching for valuables, hence why the castle was constructed above the burial grounds. The so called ""Protectors"" in the castle are called Skull Heads, creatures born from witchcraft that were placed in the castle to protect the dead from any such type of violation for the past 200 years. it's also believed that they have the power to have control on the living and the dead. After the grand tour of the castle, the film crew leave and it's revealed that they're not really Hollywood filmmakers, but really art thieves, and after viewing the castle, they plan on robbing the place the next night. The next morning, Carver tells Naomi that the breakfast that she has just received is the only thing she's eating because she's going to be put back on the rack later on. As he heads downstairs, he finds Peter trying to stick his penis in Claudia's crack. He quickly beats Peter out of the room, but then forces Claudia to keep her pants down as he unzips his pants zipper. Later that night, Kimi, L.J. and Jensen sneak into the house and start stealing items. Meanwhile, Jensen finds Naomi tied up on the rack in the basement and just as they're about to escape, they run into Carver and Lisbeth. As they fight between the right decision for Naomi, Lisbeth explains why the family always sticks together and why they act strange : Naomi is not only Carver and Lisbeth's daughter, but she's their niece and Carver and Lisbeth are not really husband and wife, they're really brother and sister. The reason Naomi is a little bit retarded is because of being an inbred and confused about who she really is. Suddenly, Lisbeth gets shot in the back and Carver, at the same time, gets shot in the chest by Kimi, who then forces Jensen and Naomi back into the basement.Skull Heads Movie, New Releases Films Kimi tricks Naomi into tying Jensen to the rack, for betraying his partner. Kimi then presses an button, which causes the rack to run automatically instead of manually. Kimi then locks Naomi in a trap where she can't move and continues to find L.J., who had just been knocked out by Peter. L.J. and Kimi then continue to grab the rest of the stuff they wanted. Meanwhile, the Skull Heads find the bodies of Carver and Lisbeth and with their power, they bring them back alive as zombies and have them go after the thieves. Carver and Lisbeth corner L.J. and Kimi at the castle's doors and they start eating off their faces, spraying blood all over the walls.PLANET OF TERROR!!: Skull Heads Meanwhile, Peter comes into the basement, releases Naomi and quickly save Jensen's life. As Naomi and Jensen are about to escape, Naomi quickly runs back upstairs to get her grandfather and Jensen finds something shocking: Naomi's grandfather has been dead for quite a while. Those who were shown talking with the grandfather were really talking to themselves. Suddenly, his body rises up and surprises Jensen, revealing one of the Skull Heads controlling his body. Jensen runs back downstairs, grabs Kimi's gun, shoots at Carver and Lisbeth near the exit  and quickly runs outside, shutting the doors behind him. Just as he thinks it's all over, a screaming Naomi opens the doors, grabs Jensen and pulls him back in, slamming the doors behind her, leaving the fate of Jensen unknown.Boning Up on SKULL HEADS"

He complains to his managing editor, Edward Heath, over the problems that have developed in his department since Phoebe Lane has been hired as his assistant. He is advised to forget it since she is the publisher's niece. During his broadcast about Honest John, a famous safe cracker who has served his time, Phoebe gives him a note that the Metropolitan Theatre is to be robbed at eight o'clock and she is so insistent that he adds it as his closing note. Off the air, he learns she got the information from a man she met in a café who had an honest face. Cranston goes to the theatre where Weston and his men have gathered and, of course, nothing happens but, across town, a safe is blown at the home of international banker Gerald Morton and the banker is killed. Cranston arrives there ahead of the police and discovers enough evidence to show him that it wasn't just a simple robbery with the banker accidentally killed. The irate Weston has him jailed as a material witness, but Phoebe comes through with a habeas corpus in time for him to make his broadcast. Honest John crashes into the studio with a gun and demands that Cranston exonerates him over the air from the police suspicion that he committed the robbery. Weston rushes to the studio but Honest John has escaped. Cranston takes Phoebe on a tour of night clubs hoping she will spot the man who gave her the robbery message. She does and Cranston poses as a new arrival from Europe and learns that the man is Flotow and his companion is Starkov. Flotow recognizes Phoebe and invites them to his apartment after the bar closes. They leave together, but Cranston knows it is a trap and makes excuses to allow Phoebe and himself to depart. However, they make a date for lunch the next day. The next day Cranston and his editor concoct an apology to appease Commissioner Weston. While Flotow and Starkov are waiting for Cranston to join them for lunch, Cranston breaks into Flotow's apartment where he meets Phoebe who also has had the same idea. Cranston answers Flotow's phone and Morton's butler says there is a meeting at the Morton home that afternoon. The call is cut short and as they wait for the butler to call back Flotow and Starkov return and attempt to detain them. Moe, Cranston's driver, rescues them by flashing his ""gun"", which is really a cigarette case. The ruse allows the three to escape.

He complains to his managing editor, Edward Heath, over the problems that have developed in his department since Phoebe Lane has been hired as his assistant. He is advised to forget it since she is the publisher's niece. During his broadcast about Honest John, a famous safe cracker who has served his time, Phoebe gives him a note that the Metropolitan Theatre is to be robbed at eight o'clock and she is so insistent that he adds it as his closing note. Off the air, he learns she got the information from a man she met in a café who had an honest face. Cranston goes to the theatre where Weston and his men have gathered and, of course, nothing happens but, across town, a safe is blown at the home of international banker Gerald Morton and the banker is killed. Cranston arrives there ahead of the police and discovers enough evidence to show him that it wasn't just a simple robbery with the banker accidentally killed. The irate Weston has him jailed as a material witness, but Phoebe comes through with a habeas corpus in time for him to make his broadcast. Honest John crashes into the studio with a gun and demands that Cranston exonerates him over the air from the police suspicion that he committed the robbery. Weston rushes to the studio but Honest John has escaped. Cranston takes Phoebe on a tour of night clubs hoping she will spot the man who gave her the robbery message. She does and Cranston poses as a new arrival from Europe and learns that the man is Flotow and his companion is Starkov. Flotow recognizes Phoebe and invites them to his apartment after the bar closes. They leave together, but Cranston knows it is a trap and makes excuses to allow Phoebe and himself to depart. However, they make a date for lunch the next day. The next day Cranston and his editor concoct an apology to appease Commissioner Weston. While Flotow and Starkov are waiting for Cranston to join them for lunch, Cranston breaks into Flotow's apartment where he meets Phoebe who also has had the same idea. Cranston answers Flotow's phone and Morton's butler says there is a meeting at the Morton home that afternoon. The call is cut short and as they wait for the butler to call back Flotow and Starkov return and attempt to detain them. Moe, Cranston's driver, rescues them by flashing his ""gun"", which is really a cigarette case. The ruse allows the three to escape. After they leave, Morton's butler calls back and Flotow knows he is suspected. Back at his office, Cranston gets valuable information from the paper's financial editor about Morton's business dealings. At the same time, Editor Heath is appeasing Weston with Cranston's apology.

""Men's souls wrestle with the thought of tomorrow, and today is the eve of tomorrow."" he says. His employee Larry Larabee  is worried about the future of their company, but Westlake attempts to placate him by reminding him that the company has survived World War I and the lean years of the Great Depression. Westlake narrates how he became a Coca-Cola bottler and has recently opened a new bottling plant in his town. The scene shifts back several years to the planning stages of the new factory, and Larabee worries about the risk of building a new plant during the Depression. ""Right now isn't the time to go sinking a lot of money—"" he begins, before a co-worker interrupts him: ""Right now isn't what we're building for. It's the future"". ""You talk just like Jim Westlake,"" Larabee responds, ""All he thinks about is tomorrow. Always tomorrow."" More scenes from the history of the bottling business follow, illustrating Westlake's willingness to spend money and time on new initiatives to grow his business, and the efforts of the company's salesmen and dealers. Details such as a Depression-era bank holiday, a 20s-era dance party, and an early wireless  help to place each scene in period context as the film proceeds through its reverse chronological narrative, moving backwards through time to show different moments in the company's history. Also illustrated is the development of manufacturing and bottling standards, in which chemists and modern quality-control methods are employed. A cooler to allow Coca-Cola to be sold ice-cold in the store is introduced. Sugar rationing during World War I threatens the company's future. The design of the well-known ""Coke bottle"" shape is said to have been inspired a woman's hobble skirt. The final scene of the film shows the business's earliest operations. Westlake is denied a loan due to a period of financial uncertainty, presumably the Panic of 1907, but remains confident about his business's future. Larabee is shown operating a manual bottling machine, which is slow and difficult to use, contrasting with the automated production line shown early in the film. He complains about the quality of their second-hand equipment, but Westlake remains characteristically optimistic."

Accused by Mr. McKinney the head of the draft board of being a draft dodger, it turns out that Stockdale's draft notices have been hidden from him by his father, who doesn't want the boy to leave home and be ridiculed. His father tells Will to be careful going to big cities like Macon and Atlanta. Pa Stockdale says he has been to those cities many years before and he was ridiculed. Wrongfully shackled by McKinney, Stockdale joins a group of new United States Air Force draftees being transported to basic training. They include the obnoxious bully Irving S. Blanchard, who having undergone ROTC training, volunteers to be in charge.  They report to boot camp, where Stockdale and his equally dim, but smarter friend, Ben Whitledge, begin the struggle to join the infantry. Stockdale is incredibly strong and can drink any man under the table. He proceeds to make life miserable for the man in charge, Master Sergeant Orville C. King, who likes his barracks to be quiet and calm. King wears Air Crewmember Wings and states, ""he is 45 years old, has eighteen years in the military service and sixteen years as a sergeant."" In exasperation, the sergeant places the country bumpkin on full-time latrine duty. Stockdale believes his new position of ""P.L.O.""  to be a promotion. The happy-go-lucky Stockdale feels that King must be ""the best dang sergeant in whole dang US Air Force."" The totally unhappy Whitledge wants no part of it, lamenting that an ""Airman"" is ""like something from a funny book."" Ben wants to be assigned to the infantry instead. A letter from his mother states, ""that Ben's six brothers have all served in the Infantry."" Ben tells Will, ""his grandfather was a Confederate Infantryman, under General Stonewall Jackson at the Battle of Chancellorsville."" Ben Whitledge says, ""In the War Between the States, it was the infantry that did the fighting,"" which is understandable, airplanes not having been invented yet. King tells Will the Captain desires to see the barracks and latrine spotless. A company inspection takes a surprising turn when Stockdale's immaculately clean latrine is what impresses King's company commander most. King gets into hot water, however, when Stockdale opens his big mouth and reveals that the sergeant kept him on bathroom duty on a permanent basis while also neglecting to have the recruit complete all the required military exams and paper work. The company commander orders King to have Stockdale through his training in one week, or else he will not only be demoted, but be made ""Permanent Latrine Orderly"" himself. Rushing him through testing, King bribes Stockdale by promising to give him his wristwatch, if he can pass. Stockdale flummoxes and frustrates the various officer and men, he takes a manual dexterity test conducted by Corporal John C. Brown , a psychiatric test by Maj. Royal B. Demming , and an eye exam, amazingly managing to get by after driving them all crazy. Stockdale gets the wristwatch as a reward. Ben comes to attention when a WAF Captain speaks, Will is speechless. Later, she is escorted into the Enlisted Men's Mess Hall by the Colonel. After being informed of military etiquette as to female officers by Ben, when Blanchard and King ask Will what he sees he says, ""a Captain."" Private Blanchard tells M/Sgt. King to get three passes to go to a local bar, ""The Purple Grotto"" where King and Blanchard try to get Stockdale drunk in order to make him look bad and King look good. He admits he has never drunk...store bought liquor. King and Blanchard are inebriated, but Will is still sober. Stockdale says the only alcohol he previously had was what his father made with corn, grain and kerosene. Blanchard buys Lighter Fluid from a cigarette girl. Mixing gin and bourbon with kerosene ... Will drinks it and says ""it's familiar."" Then a drunken Army infantryman walks by and a barroom brawl begins. Stockdale leaves behind a fighting Blanchard and King; as he walks past the Air Police, he tells them that upstairs is the bar. The colonel and captain later inspect the latrine and barracks. Will has mechanically rigged all the toilet seats to open simultaneously in a ""salute"". While Blanchard is arrested and detained by the Air Police, M/Sgt. King is found filthy in a torn uniform, later in the latrine, and is summarily reduced to private rank, while Whitledge was blamed for King's appearance and is also placed in disgraced status. As King goes back to his office dejected, he admits to Stockdale that he and Blanchard had been trying to trick Stockdale to get him out of the way so that King would not look bad, but their effort backfired. Will gives the watch back to King. King also admits he had grown to like Stockdale and became his reluctant and inadvertent mentor to success in the Air Force. Will, Ben and Pvt. King are sent to Gunnery School. Will is at the bottom of the class and Ben is next to the bottom. King graduates as the top man of the class. He is assigned to General Eugene Bush's staff and is given back his M/Sgt. rank. The story ends with Stockdale and Whitledge  flying to Denver in an obsolete B-25 medium bomber. Stockdale's assignment is tail gunner on the bomber. After putting the plane on Autopilot, the lazy pilots fall asleep, and the airplane soon becomes lost at night over what the navigator thinks is the Gulf of Mexico. They really are flying over the Atomic Bomb Test Site at Yucca Flats, Nevada, during an A-bomb test called ""Operation Prometheus"". The radio operator of the plane was left behind at the base, so Stockdale and Whitledge must radio to obtain their real position; however, the radio is inoperatable. Stockdale remembers that back home in Georgia, his father would spit into the radio and smack it to make it work. Stockdale repeats the method, and the radio works. Military radiomen on the ground, confused by Stockdale's folksy, clownish speech, have the commander of the test Maj. Gen. Vernon Pollard, U.S. Army Infantry frantically rouse Maj. Gen. Eugene Bush, U.S. Air Force from his sleep to confirm that Stockdale is not a prankster, and to give Stockdale emergency flying instructions. Bush reassures Stockdale that he is real and not a foreign agent as King tells Bush to remind Stockdale of the watch. Meanwhile, a fire breaks out in the aft of the plane. The Air Force and Army are put on full alert. Stockdale and Whitledge bail out of the plane just before it crashes, and are declared dead by the Staff Aide M/Sgt. King. During an Air Medal ceremony honoring them as fallen heroes, they reappear, and the Air Force has to cover up that the pair are alive to avoid an international public humiliation. Stockdale suggests both he and Ben  be transferred to become infantrymen. Will and Ben are taken at night to a secluded area. An agreement is reached by two former West Point classmates, General Pollard, USA and General Bush, USAF, who also heartily approve of Stockdale's last request—to have M/Sgt. King transferred with them to the infantry. General Pollard has to cut an Air Medal from his uniform. He sits as General Bush pins the Air Medal on Ben Whitledge. As a radio station signs off, to The Star-Spangled Banner, all the men snap to attention, including a reluctant General Pollard."

At one point his gang accosts the broken-down car of a music business executive, Harry Bayliss. Afterwards Bayliss wishes to call a tow truck, so he goes into the eatery where Eddy's gang is celebrating. Bayliss overhears Eddy singing to the jukebox and offers him a chance to audition for his variety program. Eddy accepts, passes his audition, and is given a spot on television. Eddy sings a two-minute song that is apparently stupendously successful, with Bayliss calling Eddy an 'overnight sensation' and prophesying an astounding rise to fame, complete with a hit record, 'a guest spot on every top show,' and eventually culminating with 'The Eddy Crane Show.' Atop Eddy's newfound success, he also immediately begins making advances at Bayliss's secretary, Helen Tracy, in preference over his long-suffering girlfriend, Iris. The specter of Eddy's stardom raises dissension among his gang, who wish either to accompany him unquestionably on his ascent, or to hold him back in their ranks. Iris is also jealous of Helen, with whom Eddy has been carrying on an affair. Helen eventually professes her love for Eddy. But one of Eddy's gang members, Moon, commits a murder, threatening to drag Eddy down by association. Moon runs from the police, but is tracked down by Eddy, who delivers him for arrest. With this he also definitively separates himself from the rest of his gang and from Iris, but also destroys his prospects for a career as a singer with his own arrest.

Coe is found dead the next morning in his bedroom, locked from the inside. District Attorney Markham , Police Sergeant Heath  and everyone else assume it was suicide since he was shot through the head and was found holding a pistol. However, Vance is not convinced. He soon finds evidence that shows that Coe was murdered. Coroner Dr. Doremus  determines the victim died of a stab wound. There is no shortage of suspects; Coe was very much disliked. His niece Hilda Lake  resented her uncle's tight control of her finances and jealousy of any men who showed interest in her. Her boyfriend, Sir Thomas MacDonald , suspected Coe of killing his dog to ensure winning the competition. Raymond Wrede , the dead man's secretary, was in love with Miss Lake, but had been laughed at when he sought Coe's support. Coe's next door neighbor and lover Doris Delafield  had been cheating on him with Eduardo Grassi . When Coe found out, he canceled a contract to sell his collection of Chinese artworks to the Milan museum for which Grassi worked. Liang , the cook, had worked long, hard and illegally to help Coe amass his collection. He warned his employer against the proposed sale and was fired as a result. Even Coe's own brother Brisbane ([[Frank Conroy  made it clear that he despised him. Finally Gamble , the head servant, had concealed his criminal past. Brisbane Coe becomes Vance's prime suspect. His alibi of taking a train at the time of the murder is disproved. However, when he is found dead in a closet, Vance is both puzzled and enlightened. Among Brisbane's effects, Vance finds a book titled Unsolved Murders; a bookmarked page details a method of using string to lock a door through the keyhole without leaving a trace. Part of the mystery is solved. Later, an attempt is made on the life of Sir Thomas using the same dagger used to kill Coe. Finally, a Doberman Pinscher belonging to Miss Delafield is found seriously injured, apparently struck with a fireside poker. From these and other clues, Vance finally solves the crime. It turns out that two men had sought Coe's life that night. The successful murderer had struggled with Coe, stabbed him, and left him apparently dead. However, Coe awakened soon after. Too dazed to recall the fight and notice that he was mortally wounded, he went upstairs to his bedroom and opened his window before dying. Brisbane entered the chamber, saw his brother apparently asleep in his chair. He shot the corpse and arranged the scene to look like a suicide. However, downstairs he ran into the actual killer, who had seen that Archer Coe was still alive and came back to finish the job. In the darkness, he mistook Brisbane for Archer and killed the wrong man. Delafield's dog then wandered in, attracted by the commotion, and attacked the murderer. While sure of the killer's identity, Vance has no proof. He therefore arranges for Sir Thomas and Wrede to quarrel over Hilda Lake. When Wrede instinctively reaches for the poker to strike his rival, the healed Doberman which Vance had brought recognizes its attacker and leaps on him. Wrede confesses he became enraged when Coe refused to assist his courtship of Miss Lake, precipitating the initial stabbing.

Lissa Roman is a very successful actress and musician busy promoting her latest blockbuster movie. She is fed up with her younger husband, Gregg Lynch, who seems to be interested only in her money and luxurious life style. Her two best friends include Taylor Singer and Kyndra. Taylor is the wife of the well known director Larry Singer. Frustrated that she is unable to have her big break, she has an affair with the much younger writer Oliver Rock. Lissa's other friend Kyndra is meanwhile enjoying a career as a soul singer, often described as a selfish diva. This has negative impact on the relationship with her daughter Saffron, an aspiring fashion designer and best friend of Nikki Roman, Lissa's daughter. When assigned to private investigator Michael Scorsinni, she finds out that her husband is cheating on her. When she arrives home and refuses to talk to him, he becomes angry, beating her up and raping her. After throwing him out of the house the next morning, she attends a dinner party of Nikki, who will marry Evan Richter in a month. She is glad to marry him, but she also has a secret crush on his brother Brian. She later kisses him at a night club, but immediately regrets the decision. Meanwhile, Lissa is bothered there by a man and eventually has to be escorted home by Michael. Gregg spots them walking together and suspects the worst. Later that night, Lissa notices that Gregg is spreading false rumours about her on national television. The next morning, Taylor is offered the lead in a movie about a lesbian love story. Her Larry disapproves of the script and is annoyed by his wife's obsession with Hollywood. Always having aspired a normal life, he regrets that his wife doesn't interact well with people who aren't familiar with Hollywood. Trying to prevent her from taking the role, he agrees to help her finally make her own movie. She is very lucky, until she finds out Oliver is assigned as her script writer. Larry soon finds out that she knew him before their meeting and suspects that they are having an affair. Meanwhile, Nikki gets kidnapped. Saffron and Brian are worried by her disappearance, but Evan doesn't really care, as he is too busy with his mistress. After the premiere of her latest movie, Lissa spends the night with Michael. They are interrupted by the message of Nikki's abduction. The kidnapper, a poor man who was angry that Lissa received a salary of $15,000,000 for one movie, demands $5,000,000. As she hands him the money, he runs away, without Nikki anywhere to be seen. Michael eventually saves the day, by catching the kidnapper and locating Nikki. In the end, Lissa promises Nikki to spend more time with her. Nikki ends her engagement with Evan to marry Brian. Larry finds out about Taylor's affair with Oliver and files for divorce, after which she decides to take the role in the movie about lesbians. Kyndra shows Saffron for the first time how much she cares about her.

Their mother, publishing heiress Anne Scripps  welcomes them in her New York mansion. Anne has recently divorced her husband Tony  and is still struggling with the divorce. Nonetheless, she is happy with her new boyfriend, much younger Scott Douglas , a volatile-tempered young man whom she marries only months after their first meeting. From the start, Alex is uncertain if she should trust Scott, having heard stories about a possible violent past. When Anne announces that she will be having a baby, Scott is distrustful to notice how Alex reacts with doubt about the news. To get rid of her, he claims that he has found marijuana in Alex's bedroom, and forces her to leave house. Alex denies the accusation, but Anne defends her boyfriend. Shortly after Anne and Scott's baby Tori's birth in June 1990, Scott gets violent and beats up Anne for inviting Tony's family for the baby's coming out party. Alex and Annie encourage their mom to leave Scott, but Anne forgives him after a couple of months, and by June 1991, she and Scott are a happy couple again. On Alex's 21st birthday, Scott lashes out at Anne again when he finds her smoking in the same room as Tori, and then throws a guest  off the stairs. Enraged, Alex dares Scott to hit her, and the police interrupts their fight, only to have Scott lie about the situation. A similar occurrence takes place at a formal ball, where Scott pushes around Anne in front of her friends. As they leave, the fight continues in the car, and Scott eventually throws her out while speeding. Three months later, Alex's charges against Scott have been dropped, though Anne has filed for divorce and attained a restraining order. The three women move on with their lives, until one night Annie is hit by her date  while Alex meets a new romantic interest, Jimmy Romeo , though a relationship is postponed due to her focus on her mother. Another stepback occurs when Anne is informed that she will have to share custody of Tori. Deciding a reconciliation would be for the better, Anne meets with Scott and believes that he has changed his life for the better. It turns out, soon, however, that Scott is still as violent as he used to be and threatens to make Tori disappear if she does not stop continuing legal proceedings. The police arrive at the mansion sometime later, though Anne is too scared to file charges. The following day, upon finding out that Scott is stealing her money and planning on running away with Tori, Anne asks for another restraining order. Alex and Annie move in with her again to protect their mother from Scott, and until Alex leaves for the holidays, they are happy again. One day, Tony calls the mansion, and Scott answers. Believing that Anne will get back with Tony, he announces that the threats are over, and that something has to be done. As soon as Annie leaves, Scott gets drunk and grabs a hammer, killing Anne while she is asleep. Afterwards, he jumps to his death off the Tappan Zee Bridge, over the Hudson River in New York, though his body is found over three months later. The girls are left behind in grief over their mother. Fifteen months later, Alex prepares to marry Jimmy, and in the aftertitles it is revealed that she gave birth to a baby daughter.

He is set afloat in the Ganga, rescued and adopted by a charioteer, who is employed with Dhritarashtra, the blind king. Years later, the now-grown up Karnan  realizes that the charioteer is his foster father only, therefore heartbroken. He does not want to become a charioteer like his foster father, and chooses to become a warrior instead. He masters archery and challenges the Pandava prince Arjuna  at a contest. When Karnan is insulted on account of his birth, the Kaurava prince Duryodhana  defends him and accepts him as his partner. Karnan is eventually crowned the king of Anga. Shortly after, a young orphan Meghanathan , who was accused of setting a school on fire, runs to Karnan seeking justice. The latter, knowing he is equally an orphan, willingly supports Meghanathan. At one time, Lord Indra, the rain god and king of heavens, disguised as an old Brahmin, goes to Karnan and asks for his Kavasam and Kundalam in daanam . Indra was apprehensive that Karnan, by virtue of his phenomenal skills as a warrior, may be able to overwhelm Arjun. He therefore asked for this gift so as to reduce his strength. Karnan had been cautioned by the Sun God that Lord Indra was going to make some such move. But Karna is so large hearted that he cannot refuse anyone. Knowing fully well, that Indra was playing a trick on him disguised as a Brahmin, he yet parts with his Kavasam and Kundalam, which were parts of his body since birth and which made him invincible. Lord Indra is taken aback at Karnan's capacity to give away anything asked for. He tells that what Karnan has done today, no ordinary mortal could have done. Immensely pleased with Karnan's generosity, Indra lets him ask for any varam . Karnan asks Indra to kindly give him the weapon Shakti which has the potential to destroy any enemy. Lord Indra gives Shakti to Karnan with the proviso however that he could use it only once and that thereafter the weapon shall return to Lord Indra. Karnan is keen to acquire the Brahmastra Mantra from the great teacher Parasurama. However, he knows that Parasurama gives instructions to Brahmins  only. So he disguises as a Brahmin and beseeches Parasurama to accept him as a sishya . Parsurama accepts him as such and starts giving him instructions. One day when Parasurama is resting in Karnan's lap, it so happens that a giant bee stings Karnan on the lower portion of his thigh. It was very painful and he starts bleeding. However, fearing that if he moved his legs, he would awaken Parasurama, he does not move at all and continues to suffer. When Parasurama wakes up, he sees Karnan bleeding, He asks Karnan about his true identity, and states that a Brahmin cannot suffer so much physical pain. Only a kshattriya  can endure so much discomfort. Karnan is obliged to disclose his identity. Parasurama is greatly enraged, because he is a sworn enemy of kshattriyas. He therefore curses Karnan that as he had learnt through deceit, he shall forget the vidya  which Parasuram had taught him at the crucial juncture. Meanwhile, Karnan saves Subhangi  from an out-of-control chariot, and they fall for each other. However, Subhangi's parents disapprove of this because they don't want their daughter to marry someone who doesn't know about his own parents. But after some time they accept, so Karnan and Subhangi are happily married. She gives birth to a son Vrishasena. Shortly before the Kurukshetra war, Lord Krishna , a supporter of the Pandavas, finds out about Karnan's true background. He tells Kunti that Karnan is her first born son who she abandoned, she realizes it soon, and so does Karnan. He reconciles with his mother. Kunti gets two wishes from Karnan, one that he will not attack the other four sons of Kunti other than Arjuna, and he will attack Arjuna with the Nagastra only once. However, Krishna goes against Karnan after this. Parasurama's curse was to prove Karnan's undoing. At the Kurukshetra war, while having a sword fight with an enemy soldier, Karnan's son Vrishasena gets killed by Arjuna's arrow upon Krishna's commands. This results in Subhangi and Karnan's dismay, making Karnan more determined to kill Arjuna. The next day during war, Karnan uses the Nagastra to kill Arjuna, but Krishna saves Arjuna by preventing the arrow from hurting him. Since he cannot use the Nagastra more than once, he is unable to kill Arjuna. A wheel of his chariot gets stuck in a big hole, and he gets down to take it out. At that time, Arjuna shoots many arrows at the helpless Karnan, severely wounding him, but is curiously unable to kill him. Krishna tells him that the great Dharma of noble charity that Karnan had performed during his lifetime was protecting him. Krishna disguises as a Brahmin, goes to Karnan and asks him his virtues as donation. Karnan who cannot say no to anyone gives his virtues to the brahmin, then dies after Arjuna shoots a few more arrows at him. The other Pandavas, who realize that Karnan was their eldest brother, arrive and are saddened by his death, so is Kunti. Arjuna, struck by guilt, curses himself for killing Karnan. But Krishna reminds him that before the final battle, the curses that inflicted Karnan  were also responsible for his death, and that there was no need for Arjuna to blame just himself. The film however ends on a positive note, as Karnan is blessed when entering heaven.

In sequence, they are ""Roadside Got Ghost"", ""Forest Got Ghost"" and ""House Got Ghost"".  Swindlers Cai, Fu and Shou are returning to Cai's house after a successful scam. Cai becomes hungry and tells his accomplices to buy him some food while he returned home. As it is late at night and they are too lazy to walk to the shops, Fu and Shou decide to steal some oranges from the roadside, placed there as offerings during the Hungry Ghost Festival. Cai eats the oranges and complains that they are tasteless. Later, the three men devise a new scheme - they would make phone calls from the phone book and each person they called would receive a random 4D lottery number, with enough calls to cover every possible combination from 0000 to 9999. Those who win the lottery are required to pay 20% commission to Cai or fall victim to harassments from loansharks. This initially works and the three set up a company, which was largely successful. One day, Cai receives a phone call. The caller gives Cai a lottery number, deploying the same hotline trick. Believing him to be a competitor, Cai naturally disregards the call, but goes ahead and tries his luck with the given number anyway. To his surprise, he wins first and second prize for the same number. On his way home with his two sidekicks, a pale-faced man suddenly confronts Cai for his commission. After teasing the man and refusing to pay, Cai receives the warning that he will be run over by a car. Cai laughs it off and runs into the middle of the road to prove it is all a hoax scare.

In the ending scene, hundreds of oranges start to roll onto a dying Cai in the middle of the road.  Nan and Lei are attending their army NS reservist training and had to trek through a jungle to reach a checkpoint using a map. Along the way, they become lost and decide to take a short cut through a supposedly haunted jungle, where they find the tombstone of a young woman in the middle of nowhere. After night falls, the two soldiers notice a woman in a red dress watching them from a distance, which frightened them. There is a huge thunderstorm the next morning. Nan and Lei meet a plump girl named Yin Yin with a white umbrella selling drinks and sought refuge at her house. There, they encounter the woman in the red dress again, and run for their lives. Yin Yin catches up with them after a while and explains that it was her, and not a ghost, that they saw back in the house. She persuades them to return to her house, making them feel more comfortable by performing magic. After a demonstration, Nan and Lei allow themselves to be strapped to chairs and noosed so they can learn one of Yin Yin's magic tricks. However, it was a trap. The two men are left hanging on a tree outside the house, as the two girls, Yin Yin and the other female ghost, are ready to depart now that they have found two people to take their place.

It is the Seventh Lunar Month and three brothers - Bao Qiang, Bao Huang and Bao Hui - all pay respects to their deceased mother.

When the ""Flying Devils"" squadron is sent to quell bandit attacks by the notorious General Lobo in Nicaragua, Panama arranges for Lefty to accompany him as his mechanic. Panama shows Lefty a photograph of Elinor, the love of his life, not knowing Lefty is in love with her too. When Elinor is sent to Nicaragua, she does not understand the guilt-stricken Lefty's cool reception. When the girl-shy Panama asks Lefty to propose to Elinor on his behalf, Elinor confesses her love for him instead, after which Panama accuses Lefty of betrayal. An urgent call for help by a Marine outpost under bandit attack stops any confrontation. Lefty flies as gunner for Steve Roberts, who makes fun of him about shooting in the right direction. During the mission, their aircraft is shot down in a swamp. Unwilling to join in the rescue, Panama reports in sick, but once Elinor convinces him that Lefty never betrayed him, he flies his own solo rescue mission. At the crash site, Roberts dies of his injuries and is cremated by Lefty using their aircraft as a funeral pyre. Panama finds Lefty but is wounded by bandits led by General Lobo, after his landing. Lefty kills the attacking bandits, takes off, and brings the pair back, putting on an impressive flying display over the base that includes safely landing the aircraft after it loses a wheel. Sometime later, Lefty has won his wings and is now an instructor at the school, married to Elinor. When his wife arrives in their new car, Lefty accidentally pulls away in reverse."

Donald the monkey  says that Stephanie will be at the zoo tomorrow, and all the animals have to do is make Griffin look like a hero in front of her. The next day, Donald unlocks the door to the lion enclosure and lets Joe out, who confronts Stephanie and Dave's fiancee Robin . Kate , the zoo's vet, manages to get them away from Joe, but Griffin fails to jump into the lion enclosure, ruining the animals' plan.

Griffin discovers that Stephanie is dating her other ex-boyfriend, a bullying alpha-male named Gale . Janet , Joe's mate, tells Griffin that the best way to attract a female is to be seen with another female, so Griffin asks Kate to with him to Dave and Robin's wedding. Griffin then takes Bernie to T.G.I. Fridays and they bond, with Bernie telling Griffin that he's his best friend. Griffin and Kate go to the wedding and seem to have fun together. Griffin becomes brave enough to stand up to Gale and this grabs Stephanie's attention. After Kate tells Griffin she had a great time with him, Stephanie asks Griffin out to dinner. Griffin accepts and they go to dinner and then go to a fashion show. Stephanie tells Griffin that his job at the zoo is holding him back, so Griffin decides to quit his job and accepts Dave's offer, which upsets Kate. Bernie also becomes upset and tells Griffin that he thought he could trust someone again, but was proved wrong when Griffin quit his job. Kate decides to leave the zoo and accepts a job in Nairobi. Griffin becomes the best employee at the car dealership, but misses working at the zoo. Stephanie proposes to Griffin, but Griffin refuses and dumps her. He then goes back to the zoo and apologizes to Bernie, who accepts Griffin's friendship. The animals then tell Griffin that Kate is heading to the airport. With Bernie's help, Griffin manages to catch up with Kate and confesses his love for her. Six months later, Griffin and Kate are back working at the zoo and Bernie is now living in a new enclosure where he gets a great view of the city.

He marries the mentally disturbed and unfaithful Clara Charnofsky  after she tells him she is pregnant with his child. Barney later finds out the child is not his, and he demands they separate. Clara commits suicide, and a devastated Barney decides to return home to Montreal. Barney soon gets a job back home and meets the woman who becomes his nameless second wife , the daughter of a wealthy Jewish family. At their lavish wedding, Barney meets Miriam Grant , and immediately falls in love. He tells Miriam his feelings for her that night but she rejects him. Despite his marriage, Barney sends Miriam flowers and gifts. Barney later picks up Boogie, who is in the middle of detox therapy, for a few days at Barney's lake house. He eventually finds Boogie in bed with his wife. Barney is at first overjoyed that he has an excuse to divorce her and pursue Miriam, but questions Boogie's integrity. The two argue, firing rounds from Barney's gun into the air before Barney collapses onto his dock and passes out, and a drunk Boogie falls back into the lake. When Barney awakens, it appears that he has shot Boogie. An abusive detective  tries to beat a confession out of Barney until Barney's father, Izzy , intervenes. Barney is let go when they cannot find a body. Barney continues to believe that Boogie ran away and throughout the movie waits for him to reappear. With his divorce finalized, Barney asks Miriam out on a date. He travels to New York City to meet her, and they finally begin a relationship. They marry and have two children as Barney gets a job producing a television series. Izzy later dies in a brothel, causing Barney to laugh and cry and call his father a ""King"". Barney and Miriam live happily until, on another vacation to the lake house, Barney meets Blair , who is trying to get a job in Miriam's line of work. Both Blair and Miriam travel to the city to try and use Miriam's contacts. Barney gets drunk at a bar and ends up sleeping with a former actress on his show. Miriam finds out about her husband's infidelity and the two divorce. Miriam later marries Blair, which contributes to Barney's mental deterioration. Years later, Boogie's body is discovered in the mountains near the lake house, apparently dead from injuries suggestive of a sky diving accident. Barney continues his slide into progressive dementia, which causes his daughter to look after him. He realizes he is losing his memory and, while they lunch at their favorite restaurant, begs Miriam to agree to be buried next to him. She agrees to think about it, and begins crying in the restroom. When she returns to the table, Barney is gone. She finds him wandering, whereupon he starts rambling about their life together. Barney's condition worsens until his death. While his children are helping settle some of his affairs at the lake house, they observe a ""water bomber"" plane scoop up water from the lake, and dump it on the mountain side fire—showing the children  what had probably happened to Boogie.  The final scene shows Miriam visiting his grave, leaving roses at a tombstone bearing both of their names."

When the story opens, it is the day of Steven's father's funeral and, while in the process of organising this event, Steven and Nancy plan to purchase a flat and move away from the parental home. Steven's brother Brian , a renowned novelist living in Mumbai, would rather spend his money on a First Class airline ticket to Goa than help finance the funeral, leaving Steven to cover the burial expenses. As guests begin to arrive at the family home, where a brief service is being held, he struggles to complete a eulogy, although everyone expects Brian the writer will be the one to deliver some appropriate remarks. Steven's cousin Maria  and her boyfriend Michael  are desperate to make a good impression on Maria's uptight father. Their hopes for doing so are dashed when Maria, hoping to calm Michael's nerves, gives him what she believes is Relaxo but actually is a designer hallucinogenic drug manufactured by her rockstar brother, Harry . While on the way to the funeral, Michael begins to feel its effect. A short man named Andrew  introduces himself to Steven, who is too busy to speak to him at that moment and suggests they talk later. None of Steven's relatives can identify the man. The service begins and the hallucinating Michael, certain he hears scratching noises in the coffin, tips it over, allowing the body to spill out onto the floor. During the ensuing chaos, Maria and Harry drag Michael outside, where their father forbids Maria to marry Michael. When Micheal is told why he is reacting as he is, he panics and locks himself in the upstairs bathroom. Maria tries to persuade him to open the door while fending off the unwelcome advances of Jim, who has a crush on her. When the drug overcomes Michael, he steps out of the window wearing just his superman boxers and a tie and sees Jim kissing Maria. Thinking what he sees reflects mutual feelings, he proceeds to climb onto the roof, where he threatens to jump. Hoping to calm him, Maria reveals she is pregnant with their child. While most of the guests are caught up in Michael's seeming insanity, Andrew meets privately with Steven and Brian and reveals he was their father's lover. Unhappy he was left nothing in their father's will, Andrew reveals photographs that prove his relationship, and attempts to blackmail the family for Rs. 20,00,000. The brothers panic and bind and gag Andrew. Steven's best friend Carlos  enters the room and asks what they are doing. The brothers quickly lie that Andrew is having sezures and to calm him down they give him the Relaxing drug they also believe is Relaxo. Harry then enters and seees Carlos holding the Relaxo bottle and freaks out because Carlos, Brian, and Steven gave Andrew three highly hallucinogenic pills. Somehow, Andrew manages to free himself as all four boys are busy trying to calm their guests, but in his drug-induced state he jumps repeatedly on the sofa before falling and hitting his head on a glass coffee table; Harry and Carlos cannot feel a pulse, so they believe Andrew to be dead. Forced to dispose of the body as quickly and surreptitiously as possible, Steven and Brian decide to place it in the casket with their father. The service resumes, and Steven's awkward eulogy is interrupted when the still very-much-alive Andrew who leaps from the coffin and the compromising photos fall out of his pocket for everyone, including the widow, to see. Steven demands everyone stay calm and declares his father was a good man, although clearly one with secrets, and he delivers a loving tribute to the man. Later Andrew reveals that he is not a lover of Steven's father and it was a made up story by him to take the revenge on the family. In the end, Maria's father agrees that she and Micheal should get married, Harry decides to give up his drug habit, Jenny stops accusing Carlos of cheating on her, and Brian agrees to take his widowed mom to live with him in Mumbai.

She meets young Lizzie Buscana , who is in the garden trying to take care of her mother's rose bush. Lady Mary tells Lizzie about the exchange program and the secret garden, whereupon Lizzie agrees to participate so she can see the garden for herself. Lizzie arrives in England and is met at the train station by Martha Sowerby , who runs Misselthwaite Manor. Lizzie quickly discovers that the children are only allowed to be in the garden on Sunday after church and must be on their best behaviour and not touch anything. Making friends with Geraldine, Steven and Robert , Lizzie visits the garden after curfew and realizes that she must help it. Returning to the manor Lizzie notices a fire in Robert's room, caused by Robert having fallen asleep with a candle still lit. After alerting everyone and helping put out the fire, she is questioned by Martha as to why she is still dressed and how she knew there was a fire. Lizzie tells Martha about her illicit visit to the garden, and Martha discovers that Lizzie stole the key to the garden. Martha discovers that Geraldine told Lizzie about the key, but Geraldine believes the key should belong to Lizzie, and that the garden has chosen her, instead of Martha, who could not find the door. Geraldine , who is jealous of Lizzie, learns that Ms. Sowerby gave the key to Lizzie, and persuades Steven to steal it in revenge for Lizzie's rejection of his feelings. When Lizzie finds the key missing, she assumes that Robert has taken it, knowing of his animosity towards her. She goes to find the key with Robert and discovers that it was Steven  who took it, on Geraldine's instructions, and threw the key in the pond. Lizzie confronts Geraldine, who initially denies it, but confesses when Martha punishes her for being a liar. Lizzie is told that maybe she does not need the key, because of the magic door. When Martha goes to meet Lady Mary, who has returned to Misselthwaite, she tells Mary of the garden's untended state, even though it has been well-tended in her absence. Lizzie realises that the garden has been starved of children's love and fun; with the help of Robert she gathers the orphans, who run to the quickly-reviving garden. Lady Mary and Sir Colin  arrive with Martha and are amazed, as the garden does not look dead as Martha had described. Lizzie tells Lady Mary that the garden needed love and that she should not have it closed. Lady Mary informs Lizzie that the garden belongs to her, and that it took ""a girl from across the sea, many years ago"" to bring the garden back to life, and that it has taken a girl from across the sea to do it again, and that it is up to her to do as she wishes with the garden. Lizzie announces that the garden will stay open so that all the children can enjoy it."

It was a year which gave birth to key features of the modern age: the thought crime; the belief that calculated acts of violence can perfect humanity; the notion that the interests of ""mankind"" can be placed above those of ""man""; the use of policemen to enforce morals; and the use of denunciation as a political tool."

Marcus's father disappeared with the eagle standard of the ill-fated legion, and Marcus hopes to redeem his family's honour by bravely serving in Britain. Shortly afterward, only Marcus's alertness and decisiveness saves the garrison from being overrun by Celtic tribesmen. He is decorated for his bravery but honourably discharged due to a severe leg injury. Living at his uncle's estate near Calleva  in southern Britain, Marcus has to cope with his military career having been cut short and his father's name still being held in disrepute. Heeding rumours that the eagle standard has been seen in the north of Britain, Aquila decides to recover it. Despite the warnings of his uncle and his fellow Romans, who believe that no Roman can survive north of Hadrian's Wall, he travels north into the territory of the Picts, accompanied only by his British slave Esca. Esca, the son of a Brigantes chieftain, detests Rome and what it stands for, but also considers himself bound to his master, who saved his life during an amphitheatre show. After several weeks of travelling through the northern wilderness, Esca and Marcus encounter Guern, one of the survivors of the Ninth Legion, who attributes his survival to the hospitality of the Selgovae tribe. Guern recalls that all but a small number of deserters were killed in an ambush by the northern tribes – including Esca's Brigantes – and that the eagle standard was taken away by the Seal People, the most vicious of the tribes. The two travel further north until they are found by the Seal People. Identifying himself as a chieftain's son fleeing Roman rule and claiming Marcus as his slave, Esca is welcomed by the tribe. After allowing the Seal People to mistreat Marcus, Esca eventually reveals that his actions were a ploy and helps his master to find the eagle. As they retrieve it, they are ambushed by several warriors, including the Seal Prince's father, but Marcus and Esca manage to kill them and escape with the eagle standard. With the aid of the Seal Prince's young son, Esca and Marcus manage to escape the Seal People's village. The two flee south in an effort to reach Hadrian's Wall, with the Seal People in hot pursuit. Marcus, slowed by his old battle wound, orders Esca to take the eagle back to Roman territory and even grants the reluctant slave his freedom. Freed, Esca still refuses to abandon his friend and instead heads out to look for help. He returns with the survivors of the Ninth legion just as the Seal People catch up with them. The legionnaires, wishing to redeem themselves, accept Aquila as their commander and prepare to defend the eagle standard. As an example to those who would betray their people, the Seal Prince kills his young son in front of Esca, Marcus, and the legionnaires; then orders his warriors to attack. A battle ensues, in which the Seal Prince and all his warriors are killed, along with most of the Ninth Legion soldiers. After burying the fallen legionnaires – including Guern – Marcus, Esca, and the few survivors of the Ninth return to Roman territory, where Aquila delivers the eagle to the astonished governor in Londinium. There is some talk of the Ninth legion being reformed with Marcus its commander. But when Marcus and Esca wonder what they will do next, Marcus leaves the decision to Esca.  The alternate ending is featured in the DVD. Marcus decides to burn the eagle standard on the altar where the final battle occurred, instead of delivering it to the Roman governor of Britannia. He tells Esca that he does this because the eagle belongs to the men who fought for it. Marcus and Esca are then shown approaching Hadrian's Wall on foot and talking about their plans for the future.

Courteous. Courageous. Committed. Almost human. Designed to handle assignments too dangerous for traditional methods, De Ming is the first in the TN Research Bureau’s ""K Series""—a revolutionary cybernetic organism programmed with a sophisticated social conscience. Sent to a remote town as part of a covert training operation, De Ming is placed under the supervision of the local police captain, Xu Dachun. Xu’s mission: facilitate De Ming’s integration into the community while protecting the secret of his young protégé’s true identity. Charmed with a talent for delivering both justice and compassion, De Ming is quick to win the hearts of the town residents—though none more completely than that of Su Mei, a fellow officer who also happens to be the object of the captain’s secret affection. Nothing in De Ming’s programming has prepared him for this. But affairs of the heart are put on hold when word arrives that one of De Ming’s cybernetic siblings, the K-88, has disappeared after suffering a critical neural meltdown. Together, the two men hunt down and confront the malfunctioning cyborg in a spectacular clash of artificial wills that leaves the captain scarred, and De Ming confused and conflicted about his role in human society. Mission completed, the consequences of De Ming’s actions continue to haunt the young cyborg. The captain’s behavior has become increasingly strange and erratic since the battle with the K-88, a fact that De Ming feels compelled to hide from co-workers and superiors. Su Mei’s behavior is no less troubling as she seems incapable of understanding that as a machine he is unable to love her in the way she so desperately desires. Torn between his bond to humanity and the knowledge that he will never be a part of it, De Ming must find within himself the strength to defeat the group of cyborg assassins that has descended on the town to avenge his betrayal of cyborg."

During this mission, Thorn  is attacked and captured by the local natives called the Botos. Before they can kill him at their village, the Botos then notice the arrival of a long-haired, topless wild woman  wearing only three necklaces and a loincloth made of beads, shells, and some feathers. The wild woman communicates with the Botos to spare him and let him go. When Thoren leaves, the wild woman heads into her treehouse. Later that night, Thoren tells the others of her experience with the wild woman and is told by one of them to take him to where he saw her. The Botos are shown doing entertainment as the wild woman plays with her pet lion cub Simba. The next day, the wild woman grabs onto a vine and swings over a lake before she lets go to drop into the lake and go swimming. When she is spotted by Thoren, she escapes into the jungle only to be later caught in a big game net by Kersten and Keller which is spotted by one of the tribesman who alerts the other Botos. Later that night, Thoren arrives and has part of the net removed from the woman's head and feeds her a banana. When the Botos attack in retaliation, Thoren hooks up a tape to a loadspeaker which frightens off the Botos as Dr. Jacqueline Goddard  undoes the net and lets her rest. After the Botos escape, the wild woman gets up and is attacked by an expedition member only for him to be beaten up by Thoren who warns him to keep his hands off her. Thoren carries her body back to the tent to let her rest. Thoren and Jacqueline then notice that one of necklaces around her neck has a good luck charm with an L engraved into it. Thoren then decides to bring it to Professor Danner to figure it out. The next day, Jacqueline gives the wild woman a bath which she enjoys, cuts her unruly hair to shoulder length, and puts her in some new clothes. Thoren comes in and tells Jacqueline that the whole world is asking for information about the white girl they found. Jacqueline says that her name is Kiyahi, but couldn't understand anything else she said. Thoren and Jacqueline then teach her some of their language and states that she must've originally come from a good family before being taken in by the Botos. Meanwhile in Germany, shipping tychoon Theo Amelongen  and his nephew Viktor  look at the article about the wild woman that was found and Theo suspects that it might be her long-lost granddaughter Liane who went missing 18 years ago when the ship she and her parents were on went down with a speculation that her Liane at 2 years old had somehow survived. Theo decides to have his agents look into this. Back in Africa, Thoren takes Liane with him and Jacqueline. When Liane's tribesman friend Tanga  and Simba show up, he ends up sneaking on the ship. While Liane, Thoren, and Jacqueline are playing cards, Tanga catches up with them and they end up taking him and the lion cub with them. When the ship arrives in Germany, the press swarm over Liana until Thoren sends then off. When the group ends up at Theo's house, he is reintroduced to Liane as well as being introduced to Tanga and Simba. Viktor is told by his lawyer that Liane will be inheriting the fortune. This causes Viktor to take matters into his old hands without Theo finding out. He ends up locking her into a room and ends up getting attacked by Tanga. At his company later, Viktor hires a man named Jensen who was one of the survivors of the ship Imperia sinking and asks to testify that he had no survivors without mentioning that Viktor hired him for this. While talking with Thoren as a bikini-clad Liane plays with Simba, Theo tells Thoren that he will watch over Liane until he gets back. They then see Liane climb up a tree and dive into the lake that she swims in until breakfast is served. Theo then commented that she had inherited her mother's swimming abilities. Theo and Thoren then look at the last letter Liane's mother wrote which says that she had given her milk to her fox terrier Terry and enjoys climbing. Later on, Blackie the dog find a piece of paper of the letter that was crumpled up. When Thoren asks who would want to try to dispose of the letter, Theo asks his maid where Viktor is. Theo then arranges to meet with Viktor tonight. When the counselor comes that evening with Viktor, they find Theo dead in his study. Moments later, the police are called in where the counselor and the maid are questioned about Theo's death. They found the evidence of the pencil and string which the inspector thinks the culprit would end up getting in to the study. It is then discovered that Viktor was responsible for his uncle's death as he makes his escape. Viktor then gets into his car as Thoren and the police pursue him. The car chase goes down the street until Viktor ends up driving his car off the bridge to his death. Back in Africa, Professor Danner gets the news that Liane has inherited the Amelongen fortune and gets a news article that Liane is heading back to Africa to visit the Danner expedition. Professor Danner considers this as a homecoming with Thoren and Tanga arriving with her. The Botos also rejoice with the news that Liane and Tanga are coming back. Liane, Tanga, and Thoren arrive with Professor Danner. While the Botos celebrate, Liane runs off into the jungle, gets naked, and goes swimming in a lake. She is then joined in her swimming by Thoren.

At 40, she is unmarried, lives only for the theatre, and realises she will probably never have children, which heightens her anguish. She looks to communicate with those around her - living or dead: the Virgin Mary, the protecting ghost of her father seated on the family sofa, the mischievous phantom of her lover perched in a tree.

He is informed that the last Governor had shot himself from 'loneliness', which dampens his spirits a little. On landing he finds his quarters are not ready for him, and he is invited to stay by the local missionary Owen Jones ([[Paul Rogers  and his sister Martha (Glynis. He soons finds their company, while friendly, a little overbearing - and returns to stay at his own residence despite it not being finished. That evening he is visited by the only other European resident of the island, known as the 'Honorable Ted' who introduces himself a drinks a large amount of Gray's whiskey. Despite having been warned that Ted was a scoundrel, Gray soon warms to him. A year after arriving on the island, Gray is disappointed to see Ted arrested and brought up before him in court for encouraging a girl at the mission to steal some money which he then spent on drink before becoming involved in a drunken brawl. Gray breaks with precedent and sentences Ted to three months hard labour on a neighbouring island. While there the local headman  suffers from apendicitus. Because her brother, who functions as a local doctor as well as running the mission, is unwell his sister travels out and successfully performs the operation. She nurses the headman back to health, while also tending to a local elephant that had injured its trunk. On the way back she travels in a boat with Ted, who has now finished his sentence. She strongly disapproves of Ted, and the fact that he and the crew are drunk on arrack. She is horrified when the propeller fails and they are forced to spend the night on a small desert island. She is convinced that Ted will try and molest her, but to her surprise he leaves her alone all night - except to put some blankets on her to stop her becoming cold. When they return to the capital, she is now slightly infatuated with Ted - in whom she can now see signs of goodness. He remains repulsed by her, and ignores her gentle attempts to get to know him better. His drunken behaviour on the island carries on as before, and he is involved in another brawl. This time Gray is forced to sentence him to deportation to Australia. His departure is delayed by a sudden outbreak of cholera which sweeps the islands. With all available hands needed in the capital, only Martha can be spared to go to the northern islands to treat the outbreak there. Because the governor and her brother are worried that the spread of disease might encourage a native rebellion they are hesitant to let her go. Ultimately they agree provided she takes Ted with her. At first he refuses to help her when he is approached, but later guiltily agrees to join her. Once they reach the northern islands, they discover the inhabitants have become hostile to them blaming the spread of the disease on the whites. However Martha persuades them to let her help, reminding them of how she saved the life of the headman months before. They assent to her presence, and she and Ted throw themselves into the task of fighting the disease. Slowly they grow extremely fond of each other, and finally embrace. Each has made an emotional journey, Martha from a repressed state to being a more sensually aware woman while Ted has changed from a morally dubious character to being a more upstanding person. After failing to save the life of a young woman, they are suddenly seized by a mob and threatened with death. Pegged out, they are about to be trampled to death by an elephant, but the animal stops at the last moment - recognising her as the woman who had nurses his trunk months before. Astonished by this miraculous survival, the native inhabitants let them go. Back in the capital, Martha and Ted marry - and he takes up playing the organ to accompany her in the mission. Gray takes some satisfaction from the fact that the number of deaths have been dramatically reduced since the last outbreak of disease.

White Mike , once a wealthy, carefree teenager, now struggles to scrape out a living as a pot dealer, dealing to his former classmates. His mother died from breast cancer a year prior to the events of the film, her treatment having completely consumed his family's wealth, and left a deep emotional trauma on Mike. Mike's good friend, Molly Norton , a sweet girl from the poorer side of town, doesn't know he is a drug dealer. Mike's supplier, Lionel , also deals the addictive drug cocktail ""Twelve"" to Mike's cousin, Charlie . Charlie attempts to mug Lionel one night, as he is unable to pay for the drug. Lionel turns the gun on Charlie, shooting him at point blank range, before finding and executing Nana , an innocent observer, returning home after a basketball game at the Harlem Recreation Center. Mike and Charlie's good friend, Hunter , another resident of the wealthy Upper East Side, set on attending Harvard, who had played basketball with—-and got in a fight with—-Nana earlier that evening, is taken into custody for the murders. He visits Harlem regularly because he detests the high society of his classmates. Several of the other young residents of the wealthy Manhattan scene are introduced at a party as customers of White Mike, including Tobias , a male model, and several others, all of whom know the attractive and popular Sara Ludlow . The party is held at the home of Yvette Vasquez & Chris Kenton , a hopeless nerd, but the host of the party, which he threw in order to boost his popularity. At the party, Sara's friend Jessica Brayson  tries Twelve for the first time, leading to an addiction over the course of the film. During the party, Chris's older brother, Claude , a sociopath and weapon collector, returns home after breaking out of rehab, much to the dismay of their mother. She realizes he is there while Chris is videoconferencing with her, and threatens to call the police. Chris tries to mediate and asks her to talk with Claude. She says she will speak to him but disconnects--with a swallow of pills--when Chris leaves the room. Sara's birthday is coming up just before the end of spring break, and she easily manipulates Chris into throwing a huge birthday bash for her, hinting that she will compensate him with sex--something she has no intention of doing. She and her friends Shelly  and Gabby  spend the next few days inviting everyone they know in order to make Sara's birthday ""famous."" Meanwhile, Jessica has run out of money as well as Twelve, but asks Lionel  to stop by Sara's party, anyways, so she can buy more Twelve. Tobias accidentally meets Molly during a drug deal with Mike, and invites her to Sara's party. Mike sees him from across the street and phones him to pick up the weed he had wanted. With Tobias gone, Mike meets with Molly, where she tells him about the male model who she allowed to flatter her and who also invited her to a party tonight. They relax over hot chocolate until she suggests visiting him at his job that evening; Mike closes up and dashes off after only a few minutes of talk. Molly is disappointed and decides to go to the party Tobias invited her to. As the party begins, Claude locks himself in his room, practicing with his weapons, as the noise grows louder downstairs. Tobias disappears into one bedroom with a girl. Lionel arrives, but is infuriated that Jessica does not have the money she promised. Since she has no money, she first offers him a blowjob, to which he responds that it must be ""one expensive blowjob."" Tearfully, she offers to have sex with him, revealing furthermore that she is a virgin. Lionel agrees and they head inside. Tobias heads back into a bedroom with a different girl. Mike's father calls him to deliver the news that Charlie is dead, his body finally having been identified. Mike tries to call Molly, who doesn't answer her phone. He goes to the party to locate her, but is stopped by several drunk party-goers. He accidentally enters the wrong room, only to find Jessica and Lionel having sex. Lionel, startled, pulls out a gun, which Mike recognizes as Charlie's. As he begins to accuse Lionel of the murder, Lionel shoots him, causing Claude to pull out his weapons and begin shooting up the party. Tobias is shot in the eye and Lionel is shot and killed, along with Sara and Timmy . Timmy was with Mark Rothko  as they frequently tried to buy pot from White Mike. Teenagers rush out of the party, but many others are shot and killed. Claude calls out for Chris who is hiding in the kitchen crying, when he hears police sirens. Claude hears them too and runs outside to die in a suicide by cop fashion. As she lays dying, Sara's last thought is how this will now make her famous. As Mike wakes up in the hospital, Molly reprimands him, having finally found out about his drug-dealing livelihood and the power he holds over the people he deals to. He wants to call her when he is sent home, but she says not to; not until he is done with this life. As the film closes, Mike visits Nana's mother, and together they connect over their shared grief--Mike, finally coming to terms with the loss of his mother, and Nana's mother , coping with the loss of her son."

Mike and Charlie's good friend, Hunter , another resident of the wealthy Upper East Side, set on attending Harvard, who had played basketball with—-and got in a fight with—-Nana earlier that evening, is taken into custody for the murders.

She says she will speak to him but disconnects--with a swallow of pills--when Chris leaves the room. Sara's birthday is coming up just before the end of spring break, and she easily manipulates Chris into throwing a huge birthday bash for her, hinting that she will compensate him with sex--something she has no intention of doing. She and her friends Shelly  and Gabby  spend the next few days inviting everyone they know in order to make Sara's birthday ""famous."" Meanwhile, Jessica has run out of money as well as Twelve, but asks Lionel  to stop by Sara's party, anyways, so she can buy more Twelve. Tobias accidentally meets Molly during a drug deal with Mike, and invites her to Sara's party. Mike sees him from across the street and phones him to pick up the weed he had wanted. With Tobias gone, Mike meets with Molly, where she tells him about the male model who she allowed to flatter her and who also invited her to a party tonight. They relax over hot chocolate until she suggests visiting him at his job that evening; Mike closes up and dashes off after only a few minutes of talk. Molly is disappointed and decides to go to the party Tobias invited her to. As the party begins, Claude locks himself in his room, practicing with his weapons, as the noise grows louder downstairs. Tobias disappears into one bedroom with a girl. Lionel arrives, but is infuriated that Jessica does not have the money she promised. Since she has no money, she first offers him a blowjob, to which he responds that it must be ""one expensive blowjob."" Tearfully, she offers to have sex with him, revealing furthermore that she is a virgin. Lionel agrees and they head inside. Tobias heads back into a bedroom with a different girl. Mike's father calls him to deliver the news that Charlie is dead, his body finally having been identified. Mike tries to call Molly, who doesn't answer her phone. He goes to the party to locate her, but is stopped by several drunk party-goers. He accidentally enters the wrong room, only to find Jessica and Lionel having sex. Lionel, startled, pulls out a gun, which Mike recognizes as Charlie's. As he begins to accuse Lionel of the murder, Lionel shoots him, causing Claude to pull out his weapons and begin shooting up the party. Tobias is shot in the eye and Lionel is shot and killed, along with Sara and Timmy . Timmy was with Mark Rothko  as they frequently tried to buy pot from White Mike. Teenagers rush out of the party, but many others are shot and killed. Claude calls out for Chris who is hiding in the kitchen crying, when he hears police sirens. Claude hears them too and runs outside to die in a suicide by cop fashion. As she lays dying, Sara's last thought is how this will now make her famous. As Mike wakes up in the hospital, Molly reprimands him, having finally found out about his drug-dealing livelihood and the power he holds over the people he deals to. He wants to call her when he is sent home, but she says not to; not until he is done with this life. As the film closes, Mike visits Nana's mother, and together they connect over their shared grief--Mike, finally coming to terms with the loss of his mother, and Nana's mother , coping with the loss of her son."

When she arrives there with the police accompanying her, she catches sight of a man in the distance wearing an old coat of her husband's. When he is pursued and captured, he turns out to be Duds Morrison a former soldier and out-of-work actor recently let out of prison. He refuses to tell them anything, and having nothing they can charge him with, the police release him. His interest aroused by the pictures sent to Meg, her new fiancé Geoffrey Leavitt follows Morrison and tries to demand an answer from him about his sudden appearance masquerading as Meg’s dead husband. Morrison again refuses to talk, and tries to flee from Leavitt - into an ally where he is set upon by a gang of ex-soldiers who beat him to death and take Leavitt off as a prisoner. It is soon revealed that they are ex-commandos and former comrades of Morrison, with whom they served on a raid in Brittany in the Second World War. The commander of the raid had been Major Elgin, the husband of Meg. They were led to believe that Elgin had secreted a large amount of treasure in a house in Brittany and now that he is dead they are desperate to get their hands on it. They are wary of their former Sergeant, a psychopath named Jack Havoc, who has recently escaped from prison and committed several murders, who is also seeking out the treasure. Believing that Morrison was an accomplice of Havoc, they attacked him. Wearing their old uniforms they have spent the past few years trying to carve out a living as street musicians, begging from passers by. Realising that releasing Leavitt might open them to being charged for the murder of Morrison, they bind him up and keep him as a prisoner. He is rescued later by a patrol policemen who investigates the squat while the musicians are out. Leavitt returns to Meg and together they head to Brittany to find the treasure. Havoc, now united with his former comrades, also travels to France where he discovers to his disgust that when Major Elgin had spoken of his ‘priceless’ treasure he had in fact been referring to its artistic beauty rather than its monetary worth. The treasure is in fact a statue of the Madonna.

On returning to Sweden after nearly a year living abroad, Salander reconnects with her former lover Miriam Wu  and offers her free use of her previous apartment in return for forwarding her mail. Later, Salander confronts her guardian, Nils Bjurman ([[Peter Andersson  after hacking into his email account and discovering he has an appointment booked with a tattoo removal specialist. Threatening him with his own gun, she warns him not to remove the tattoo that she etched on his abdomen as revenge for sexually abusing her, marking him as ""a pervert, a rapist and a sadistic pig"". Millennium magazine welcomes Dag Svensson , a new journalist who is writing an exposé on prostitution and human trafficking in Sweden. Dag's girlfriend, Mia Bergman, is writing her doctoral thesis on sex trafficking. Dag is nearly finished with the story and is confronting those who will be exposed by the article. Dag and his girlfriend are about to leave on a holiday and ask Mikael Blomkvist  to come to his apartment and collect some photographs. At the same time Dag also asks Mikael to inquire about someone called ""Zala"", who may have a connection to his present research. Mikael arrives at their apartment late at night to collect photographs for the article but finds them shot dead. The gun used is tracked to Bjurman, who is also dead. Salander is the prime suspect, as her fingerprints are on the gun. Bublanski, the police officer leading the investigation, advises Blomkvist that he should stay out of it. Salander tells Blomkvist she did not kill Dag and Mia and that he needs to find the mysterious ""Zala"". In an effort to find Salander, Blomkvist contacts her boxing trainer and friend, Paolo Roberto. While he is unaware of Salander's whereabouts, he does know Miriam, who also trained with them, and promises to pay her a visit. Near her apartment, Paolo witnesses Miriam being kidnapped by strongman Niedermann. Paolo follows his car to a deserted barn, where he hears him beat Miriam for information about Salander. Paolo comes in to rescue her but Niedermann incapacitates him. Niedermann sets the barn aflame, believing he has killed Paolo and Miriam, but they have actually secretly escaped. News breaks of the attack and Paolo gives his account to the police. After Blomkvist leaves information he has discovered about the case on his computer for Salander to hack into and read, she leaves a message to him saying, ""Thank you for being my friend"". He realizes that she intends to set out alone to find the man who framed her and that she may not survive. A disguised Salander visits Miriam in hospital to apologize for getting her involved. Without giving anything away, Salander confirms the police sketch of Niedermann with Miriam and then disappears. Knowing now that he is Salander's friend, Miriam calls Blomkvist to the hospital to give him keys that Salander dropped accidentally during her visit. Noticing they are for a post office box, Blomkvist is able to access and read Salander's mail and track down her apartment. Meanwhile, Salander continues her efforts to find Niedermann by watching his post office box. She sees someone check the post box and follows him to a small house near Gosseberga. Researching through the material in her apartment Blomkvist finds the video of Bjurman raping Salander. In the offices of Millennium magazine, Paolo explains he tracked down Niedermann and learned that he has congenital analgesia: Niedermann is unable to feel pain. They trace Niedermann to a company owned by ""Karl Axel Bodin"". Blomkvist has Erika Berger make copies of the documents including the 1993 police report and forwards the originals to Bublanski, and sets out to find Salander. Salander crosses the grounds and enters the Gosseberga house, but Niedermann has been alerted by motion detectors and knocks her out. She awakens to see her father, Zalachenko, an old man who walks with a stick and is heavily scarred by the burns she inflicted as a child. He dismisses her mother as a whore and belittles her rape at the hands of Bjurman. He reveals that Niedermann is her half-brother. Niedermann killed Bjurman to prevent him from revealing any of Zalachenko's secrets. Zalachenko is confident he will not be caught, since being an invalid means the idea of his involvement in the murders lacks plausibility. They lead Salander to a shallow grave in the woods. She tells him the police will find him soon and all that he has said has been published online through her hidden cellphone. Seeing through her bluff, he shoots her several times as she attempts to escape and buries her alive. Left for dead, Salander digs her way out using her silver-plated cigarette case. Hidden in the woodshed, she surprises Zalachenko with an axe to the head. Salander scares Niedermann off with the help of Zalachenko's gun, just as Blomkvist finds them. Ambulances and police arrive to take away Salander and Zalachenko, who are both badly hurt but still alive."

In return, the prince promises that the Emperor will make him governor of Hu Bei. Su's step brother Yuan is envious of Su, but Su loves him and asks the prince to make Yuan governor instead. Su wants to leave the military and lead a life pursuing the perfection of Wu Shu, eventually in the hopes of starting his school and teaching his skills. Su gives his great prestigious sword to a comrade Ma, then tells Yuan of his plans. Yuan expresses that he is always in Su's shadow but accepts the governorship. Early next morning, Su leaves on a horse. Five years later, Su and his wife Ying  have a child, Feng. Su's father informs them that Yuan is returning from the military to be a governor. He warns Su that Yuan may not have come back simply to reconcile with family but to seek revenge. This is because years ago, Su's father killed Yuan's father when the latter went too far in learning an evil martial arts technique called the Five Venom Fists. Su's father then took Yuan in, but he harbours concern that Yuan is still vengeful. Su is naive and assures his father that everything will be alright. When Yuan returns, a homecoming party is held. Yuan greets his sister Ying, Feng, and Su's father. Su's father knows what is impending and asks Yuan to take his revenge on him alone, sparing Su and his family. Using his mastery of the Five Venom Fists, Yuan kills Su's father and decapitates him. He expresses his desire to be with his sister  and her son Feng as a family. When Su hears the news of his father's murder, he rushes to the scene of his father's death and is attacked by the Iron Twins. He chases them to a rapid where Yuan is offering Su's father's head to his real father as a symbol of revenge taken. A battle ensues between Yuan and Su. Yuan has a dark armour sewn into his body, making him partially invulnerable to blades. Using his Five Venom Fists, Yuan deals a deadly poisonous blow to Su who is defeated. Feng begs for Su's life and Yuan spares him but throws him into the rapids. Ying jumps into the rapid to save Su and Yuan is heartbroken at the loss of his beloved sister. He takes Feng in as his only family. Ying awakes in forest area and tries to bring her husband to civilization and safety. They are found by a herb researcher and wine maker, Sister Yu, who treats Su's wounds. Su comes to consciousness but is broken to find his right arm severely weakened with all tendons torn. At first, he is desperate and turns to drinking, but with Ying's support, he focuses on training in order to save Feng. He meets Wu Shu God and an old sage and asks to be their disciple. At a sacred site, he trains with the Wu Shu God for years, always trying to defeat him but never able to. Later, by checking Su's pulse, Dr. Du reveals to Ying that Su is going mad and that there is probably no Wu Shu God or Old Sage since she is the only one living in the area. Ying follows Su into the forest one day and finds him fighting  with himself, oblivious to the fact that he is only battling with the Wu Shu God in his mind. Ying pleads with Su to come to his senses but he does not believe her. By the time Su realizes the truth, it is too late. Ying has left to try to save Feng by herself. At Yuan's palace, Ying is now a captive of Yuan. Su arrives shortly after and fights his way through the guards. He also battles the Iron Twins and with his improved skills, impales both on a satay, a saber like spear. Yuan orders his men to bury Ying alive in a box and then kills the men who buried her so that only he knows her location. A crazed Su battles with Yuan in his training chamber and ultimately defeats him, even gnashing though a poisonous snake in the process. Feng screams that Yuan must not die because only he knows Ying's location, but a maddened Su delivers a fatal blow to Yuan's throat, thus executing him in anger. Realizing the words of Feng, he rushes out and a dying soldier reveals the vague location of Ying. Su and Feng rush to search for her but manage to dig her out too late. Ying dies from lack of air. The era changes from the dynastic to the colonized. Su has lost his mind after the loss of his wife and the previous delusions he had. A homeless Feng leads his father through the streets by rope and takes care of him. A Kung Fu master is killed in a fighting arena - part of a foreigners' club - leaving Su's old friend, Ma, as leader of the Wu Shu Federation. The arena is a stage below which tigers lurk freely, waiting for any unfortunate fighter to drop below. In the meantime, Su goes into an inn and creates trouble by stealing wine and countering people bent on stopping him with martial art moves. He then meets a fellow drunkard who spars with him and gives him a few philosophical tips. The two of them start using Drunken Fighting  techniques, and Su regains his sanity. The inn lady calls Ma to deal with Su and Ma recognizes Su. They have a talk and Ma gives Su back his sword. Su asks Ma to take care of Feng since he is unfit to be a father but Feng persists, staying with his father instead. The next day, Su and Feng show up to support Ma in his arena battle. Su goes about drinking in the club's bar area, oblivious to Ma receiving a serious beating in the ring. When Feng tries to save Ma from being killed, the opposing wrestler grabs Feng and holds him in the air. Feng screams for help from his father. His son's cries awake Su from his drunken state and Su rushes into the arena. As Ma and Feng are being taken out of the arena by bystanders, Su battles and defeats the wrestler. Anthony, owner of a wrestling stable, orders his lot to pour into the arena, resulting in a mismatch of three wrestlers to one . Using the drunken martial arts technique learned from his fellow drunkard in the inn, Su's defeats the fighters although he is heavily injured. At the end of the battle, the other fighters are either dead or unconscious, and only after a vision of Ying and the dramatic cries of Feng in an otherwise silenced arena, does a semi-conscious Su manage to stand up. He is declared the winner. The film ends with a seemingly restored Su practising his moves of old but with long hair reminiscent of the insane period of his life, with Feng observing. Su has seemingly found his passion.

Lisbeth Salander is airlifted to a hospital in Gothenburg. Surgeons remove bullets from her shoulder, hip and head, bullets fired by her father, Alexander Zalachenko . She is cared for by Dr. Jonasson, who prevents anyone except her lawyer from visiting. At the same time Evert Gullberg and Fredrik Clinton, old colleagues from the ""Section,"" a group within the Swedish Security Service, reconnect and decide that they must silence Zalachenko and Lisbeth to preserve cold war secrets. Zalachenko is still alive, in a hospital room down the hall from Lisbeth. Mikael Blomkvist asks his sister, Annika, to be Lisbeth's lawyer in her up-coming murder trial. Gullberg arrives at the hospital at the same time as Annika, proceeds to Zalachenko's room, and shoots him dead. Annika saves Lisbeth by barricading the door to Lisbeth's room, preventing Gullberg from killing her too. Gullberg then shoots himself. Clinton visits psychiatrist Dr. Peter Teleborian, and explains his plan to silence Lisbeth by having her committed to St. Stephen's mental hospital again. Teleborian tries to meet with Lisbeth to conduct a psychological evaluation but is prevented by Dr. Jonasson. Mikael Blomkvist persuades Dr. Jonasson to sneak an internet phone into Lisbeth's room, whereupon Lisbeth immediately contacts her information source, Plague, to see if he can find something on Teleborian, and then tells Mikael that Annika has permission to use a video of Nils Bjurman&nbsp;– her former guardian and one of the people she is accused of murdering&nbsp;– raping her. Mikael compels a civil servant, Bang Janeryd, to reveal that Gullberg and Rottinger had visited the Prime Minister years ago to urge a cover-up of the Zalachenko affair. Lisbeth starts working on an autobiography to document her actions and motives from childhood to the present. She continues to have nightmares of memories about her time at St. Stephen's, her father and half-brother, and of her rape by Bjurman. Mikael continues to pursue Teleborian, with Christer's help. They also follow a Section member to a flat that Fredrik Clinton had been to four hours before. Lisbeth finishes her autobiography and sends it to Mikael, and Jonasson informs Lisbeth she cannot remain at the hospital but must be transferred to prison in a couple of days. He is surprised that she is not worried about the trial. The strongman Niedermann, who previously tried to kill Lisbeth's best friend, has remained a fugitive, wanted for killing a police officer. Sonny, of the motorcycle gang from the previous film, is informed that he was searched, but found clean, and that his friend had sent Niedermann to hide out in his home. There, he finds his brother dead and his girlfriend tied, gagged, and apparently assaulted. She tells him that Niedermann was the culprit, and Sonny vows revenge. Clinton, in dialysis, is given a copy of Lisbeth's autobiography, and is told that none of it can be proven. Meanwhile, Erika has been receiving anonymous e-mail threats, which causes an uproar in the office. In prison, Lisbeth is interrogated by the prosecutor but says nothing. Annika is later given Lisbeth's computer and the DVD, which she watches. Niedermann breaks into an abandoned warehouse and kills a witness, a random cyclist. Teleborian finally meets with Lisbeth, who again remains silent. Erika's bedroom window has been smashed, and in desperation she has called Milton Security. Mikael learns that someone has just broken into his apartment and planted cocaine and cash there. He concludes that they are trying to frame him, since they cannot hurt the magazine. Mikael decides to meet Erika at a restaurant named ""Samir's Gryta."" The police try to warn Mikael of an attempt to kill them there, and Mikael fends off the assault as the police hurry toward the restaurant. The Section is dismayed to find their hired hit men have failed. On the day of her murder trial, Lisbeth enters court with piercings, a mohawk hairstyle, black makeup, and dark clothing. Called as an expert witness for the prosecution, Teleborian characterizes Lisbeth's autobiography as merely the product of her paranoid delusions. Annika gradually demolishes Teleborian's credibility, using Lisbeth's words and files from the hospital. She shows the video proving Bjurman raped Lisbeth, demonstrating that her statements were completely true. As Annika presents her case, the police arrest the people involved with the Section and seize their place of operation. Called to the stand, Mikael shows that Teleborian had written his psychiatric opinions before he had even been allowed to interview Lisbeth. Then Annika calls Edklinth to the stand, and he states that the opinions were formulated in cooperation with Jonas Sandberg, using his computer as proof. Teleborian is left speechless. Edklinth tells Teleborian he is to be arrested on charges of possessing over 8,000 items of child pornography , and his computer is seized as evidence. After Teleborian is arrested, the court rules that there is no further need for Lisbeth to be detained in custody. The Millennium workers celebrate their victory, as Erika leaves the newspaper job and returns as editor in chief. Lisbeth is encouraged by Annika to check the property she has inherited from Zala and discovers the warehouse where Niedermann was hiding. Niedermann attempts to trap her in the warehouse and kill her, but she is too fast for him. She uses a nail gun to nail Niedermann's feet to the floor. She considers nailing him in the head but instead phones Sonny and tells the bikers where to find him. Then she calls the police after the bikers arrive. Lisbeth returns home, Mikael briefly visits her to tell her that the motorcycle gang killed Niedermann and were arrested soon after. They have a brief conversation that might or might not be a prelude to a further relationship."

A sweetly naive 18 year-old guitar player, he dreams of putting together his first band. Richie has the perfect musical collaborator in his best friend, Kevin Tucker , who has a voice second only to James Brown. Richie buys a used Les Paul model electric guitar from Jerry Domino , who owns a tropical fish emporium, but also runs a few other ""businesses"" on the side. Percy Price  is a local legend on the saxophone. The kids used to listen to him practicing at night when they were growing up. Percy agrees to help Richie and Kevin to form a group, letting them practice at the local mortuary where he works. However, the owner Lewis Moss  wants to sell the business to the local Alderman, who plans to turn it into a disco. Richie, Kevin and Percy begin to put the band together, searching the city for horn players. Richie stumbles upon Harold Tate , a hillbilly sax player, while Harold is washing windows at the music store where Richie works. Harold's mean uncle yanks him away from an impromptu jam session before Richie can get his name or address. Richie scours the city to find the young wunderkind and then hilariously conspires with Kevin to get Harold a horn to play. The band starts coming together, and Percy even manages to set up their first gig in a club where blues legend B.B. King often performs. However, annoyed with the music during a customer’s funeral, Alderman Waller orders Mr. Moss to fire Percy, and the group must find a new place to practice. Fortunately, Jerry Domino lets the kids use a rehearsal space above his tropical fish emporium. During a rehearsal, Percy has a heart attack while playing a solo, and dies. Stunned by their mentor’s death, the kids sadly take his body back to the mortuary for a courtesy funeral. However, Mr. Moss informs them that Percy's insurance policy had lapsed, and callously demands they pay the funeral cost or take Percy's body to the County morgue. But Mr. Moss makes the mistake of calling Ronnie Roosevelt , a man listed as ""next-of-kin"" on Percy's lapsed insurance policy. Mr. Moss tricks Ronnie into believing that he is the beneficiary of the policy, when in fact, Mr. Moss only hopes to sell him an expensive funeral service for Percy. Ronnie is a New Orleans piano man with a soulful voice and a voodoo attitude. He is outraged to learn that he was duped into coming to Chicago and he threatens Mr. Moss with an especially unpleasant form of death. As if by magic, Mr. Moss is found dead at his expensive home, and the kids decide to take matters into their own hands. When Kevin learns it will be a closed casket ceremony for Mr. Moss, he and Kevin switch Percy's and Mr. Moss' bodies, so that Percy will get the expensive funeral. That night the mortuary is filled with music and musicians as they celebrate a New Orleans style wake. Mr. Moss' body ends up in the autopsy room of the County Morgue. The Stony Island Band’s debut is a smash. The evening is dedicated to Percy, whose spirit arrives just in time to finish the solo he was playing when he died."

They were orphans raised by a rich landowner named Clifford Downey and his dancer wife, Mona Rowland-Downey. Upon her death, Mona leaves her entire {{convert}} ranch in Santa Barbara, California in the care of only one son, Ruben. The other brother begins plotting how to win control of the property away from his estranged twin. Ruben's main concern at the moment is that his wife Laura has left him. She can't comprehend how her loving husband could have cheated on her with another woman. Ruben tracks her to Chicago, where he meets used-car salesman Lou Perilli. He is assured that Laura will come back to him eventually. In the meantime, being pursued by a tough customer named Nick Zangaro about a debt he owes, Lou decides to make a quick getaway out west to Santa Barbara. Eddie Agopian, a family lawyer, is in charge of watching over Ruben's interests. But suddenly he disappears. Local authorities, including Sheriff Otis and a corrupt judge, have begun harassing Ruben and the dozens of workers and friends who live at the ranch. They are the stooges of powerful businessman Reed Tyler, who has business interests with Ruben's brother, Robby. Lou becomes a partner to the timid Ruben by promising to help him with his legal troubles. Lou has no lawyer experiences, but begins doing some investigating on Ruben's behalf and does the best he can in court. He also helps Ruben track down Eddie, who has absconded to Mexico with a stash of money. A scam is exposed, revealing to Laura that it was not her husband who had relations with another woman but Robby, his evil twin. Ruben, Laura and Lou quickly hatch a scheme of their own, catching the sheriff and judge in compromising positions and luring Robby into one with the help of a couple of young women hired for the occasion. The relationship between the brothers is healed a bit, if not completely, by the end as Ruben finds happiness at the ranch with his wide assortment of friends and family.

The divorced Ann proves attractive to Charley. She is a bright conversationalist and bakes delicious cheesecake that she sells. Charley enjoys being with her and helps her land a job at the hospital, but with all the available women out there, he is reluctant to commit to a monogamous relationship. Ann finally persuades him to agree to a trial period of a few weeks. At the hospital, a botched diagnosis leads to the death of a wealthy owner of a baseball team. The widow, Ellen Grady, intends to sue for millions, saying the only thing she knows about medicine is that nobody at this place can practice it. Charley tries to charm her. They share a common background and Mrs. Grady is definitely interested in him. But she nonetheless adamantly refuses to drop the lawsuit, and when Charley neglects a date with Ann and shows up late with a lame excuse, she angrily hides his clothes while he showers. Ann also wants him to show some backbone in not nominating Willoughby for chief of medicine, but he does so anyway. Willoughby reneges on a promise to stop personally treating patients, however, so Charley takes back his nomination. He then does his best to win Ann back as well."

Although not entirely happy with his new gig, Smilac finds a love interest in Candace Vandervagen , the daughter of the politician's wealthy campaign booster.

Boyd is ready to give up his fruitless search for gold. Cherry reinvigorates him and persuades him to join her side. She sends him, Fraser and Balt to Seattle to get a loan of $200,000 from Cherry's banker friend, Tom Hilliard, to rebuild a cannery. After concluding the deal, Boyd goes to see his socialite fiancée, Mildred Wayland . She is determined to marry him, despite her father's wish that she wed someone with wealth: none other than Fred Marsh. When Marsh provokes him, Boyd carelessly blurts out his plans. Wayne Wayland and Marsh between them see to it that the financing is withdrawn. Notified, Cherry sails for Seattle and dines with Hilliard. It soon becomes plain to the banker that Cherry has fallen in love with Boyd. He explains that the young man already has a girlfriend, and points out the couple dancing elsewhere in the establishment. Cherry then secures the loan by taking up Hilliard's offer to go to his apartment. Boyd assumes, however, that it was due to Mildred's influence with her father.

He subsequently receives a sailing scholarship to Stanford University. Charlie graduates from Winslow High School and after getting home from his graduation ceremony, Charlie promises Sam that they will practice baseball together every day until he leaves for Stanford; at sunset when the “Bailey’s Yacht Club” ceremonial cannons sound. Later that night, Charlie was supposed to go to a graduation party with his friends, but his mother Claire  makes him babysit Sam while she picks up another shift at her job as a nurse. When Sam is watching television, Charlie tries to sneak out and go to the party. But he is caught by Sam when he turns his headlights on, and Sam asks Charlie to drive him to his friend Tommy's house to watch the Red Sox game. At first Charlie refuses, but gives in when Sam makes compliments about his car. While driving, Charlie and Sam talk about Charlie's departure and horseplay until they get into a bad car accident at an intersection. Their car is rear ended by a SUV, forcing them into the path of a Mack truck in a T-bone collision. In the dark, during an out-of-body experience, Charlie hugs a badly wounded Sam and tries to reassure him that everything will be fine once he takes the blame for his actions. Knowing that his injuries are fatal, Sam asks Charlie to never leave him alone again, saying that if he does, they will always be together as brothers. Charlie promises they will always be together. Then a paramedic named Florio Ferrente  revives Charlie, who sobs in horror when he realizes that Sam has succumbed to his wounds. At Sam's funeral, a broken-hearted Charlie runs off after refusing to put Sam's baseball glove in the grave. After a heartbroken run through the neighboring woods, Charlie finds Sam's spirit and discovers that Sam can interact with him on the physical plane. After their reunion, Charlie fulfills Sam's dying wish by practicing baseball with him every day at sunset, in the canyon, after the sounding of the cannons. Five years later, Charlie, who gave up his scholarship and mournful over Sam's loss, is now caretaker at Waterside Cemetery. During a trip into town, Charlie visits the boat docks and meets Tess Carroll , a sailor who is scheduled to sail solo around the world. The following day, Charlie runs into Florio Ferrente, the paramedic who saved his life. Ferrente is dying of cancer and questions Charlie if he ever wonders why he was saved and tells him there is a reason for his gift. Charlie returns to the cemetery and finds Tess injured tending her father's grave. He takes her back to his home to patch her up and they develop a relationship. Meanwhile, Sam begins to feel being transparently erased from existence as a certain sign that Charlie is forgetting him when Charlie arrives late for their game of catch. However, Tess follows Charlie and he explains to her that the more he is in her world, the less he can be in Sam's. Later, Charlie discovers that Tess had gone missing while sailing through a storm a few days earlier, revealing that Charlie could see her just like he could Sam. Ferrente's wife Carla comes to Charlie and tells him that Ferrente had died the previous night and to give him his St. Jude medal that he wore the night Charlie was revived. Charlie examines the pendant. After one of the evenings Charlie and Tess have together they play hide and seek. Tess sticks a note on the door which says ""come find me"" with a drawing of a boat under. Later on in the story this is seen as her asking Charlie to find her after the storm has washed her on shore but she is dying. It is then that Charlie realizes that Tess is not dead and that he has to find her to save her life. Along with his friend Alistair and Tess's coach Tink, Charlie takes a boat to find Tess based on Charlie's instincts that he knows where she is due to what she told him and what he'd do himself. The following sunset, Charlie finally misses his game with Sam. As Charlie confesses his love for his departed sibling, Sam simply tells Charlie that he loves him back and takes off as a shooting star to point out Tess' location. The group finds Tess' wrecked boat along with her lying on the rocks. Charlie uses his body heat to keep both himself and Tess warm until the two are eventually found by a Coast Guard Jayhawk called in by Tink. Charlie and Tess are taken to the hospital where Alistair tells Charlie that Tess had hypothermia and that he saved her. Later, Charlie purchases an old boat and asks Tess if she would like to take a ride with him. However, Tess fears him explaining that she had been having vivid dreams about them together. Charlie tells Tess that her dreams are memories and recites a quote from her dad's funeral that they had spoken about in her dreams. Charlie decides to resign from his job and goes into the forest to reminisce and say farewell to Sam, telling him they'll always be brothers and although he is unable to see him, Sam is there too and reveals that he's at peace, before Charlie leaves the forest with Tess. During the credits, Charlie and Tess finally sail around the world and say goodbye to the citizens of Quincy Harbor, Washington."

He subsequently receives a sailing scholarship to Stanford University. Charlie graduates from Winslow High School and after getting home from his graduation ceremony, Charlie promises Sam that they will practice baseball together every day until he leaves for Stanford; at sunset when the “Bailey’s Yacht Club” ceremonial cannons sound. Later that night, Charlie was supposed to go to a graduation party with his friends, but his mother Claire  makes him babysit Sam while she picks up another shift at her job as a nurse. When Sam is watching television, Charlie tries to sneak out and go to the party. But he is caught by Sam when he turns his headlights on, and Sam asks Charlie to drive him to his friend Tommy's house to watch the Red Sox game. At first Charlie refuses, but gives in when Sam makes compliments about his car. While driving, Charlie and Sam talk about Charlie's departure and horseplay until they get into a bad car accident at an intersection. Their car is rear ended by a SUV, forcing them into the path of a Mack truck in a T-bone collision. In the dark, during an out-of-body experience, Charlie hugs a badly wounded Sam and tries to reassure him that everything will be fine once he takes the blame for his actions. Knowing that his injuries are fatal, Sam asks Charlie to never leave him alone again, saying that if he does, they will always be together as brothers. Charlie promises they will always be together. Then a paramedic named Florio Ferrente  revives Charlie, who sobs in horror when he realizes that Sam has succumbed to his wounds. At Sam's funeral, a broken-hearted Charlie runs off after refusing to put Sam's baseball glove in the grave. After a heartbroken run through the neighboring woods, Charlie finds Sam's spirit and discovers that Sam can interact with him on the physical plane. After their reunion, Charlie fulfills Sam's dying wish by practicing baseball with him every day at sunset, in the canyon, after the sounding of the cannons. Five years later, Charlie, who gave up his scholarship and mournful over Sam's loss, is now caretaker at Waterside Cemetery. During a trip into town, Charlie visits the boat docks and meets Tess Carroll , a sailor who is scheduled to sail solo around the world. The following day, Charlie runs into Florio Ferrente, the paramedic who saved his life. Ferrente is dying of cancer and questions Charlie if he ever wonders why he was saved and tells him there is a reason for his gift. Charlie returns to the cemetery and finds Tess injured tending her father's grave. He takes her back to his home to patch her up and they develop a relationship. Meanwhile, Sam begins to feel being transparently erased from existence as a certain sign that Charlie is forgetting him when Charlie arrives late for their game of catch. However, Tess follows Charlie and he explains to her that the more he is in her world, the less he can be in Sam's. Later, Charlie discovers that Tess had gone missing while sailing through a storm a few days earlier, revealing that Charlie could see her just like he could Sam. Ferrente's wife Carla comes to Charlie and tells him that Ferrente had died the previous night and to give him his St. Jude medal that he wore the night Charlie was revived. Charlie examines the pendant. After one of the evenings Charlie and Tess have together they play hide and seek. Tess sticks a note on the door which says ""come find me"" with a drawing of a boat under. Later on in the story this is seen as her asking Charlie to find her after the storm has washed her on shore but she is dying. It is then that Charlie realizes that Tess is not dead and that he has to find her to save her life. Along with his friend Alistair and Tess's coach Tink, Charlie takes a boat to find Tess based on Charlie's instincts that he knows where she is due to what she told him and what he'd do himself. The following sunset, Charlie finally misses his game with Sam. As Charlie confesses his love for his departed sibling, Sam simply tells Charlie that he loves him back and takes off as a shooting star to point out Tess' location. The group finds Tess' wrecked boat along with her lying on the rocks. Charlie uses his body heat to keep both himself and Tess warm until the two are eventually found by a Coast Guard Jayhawk called in by Tink. Charlie and Tess are taken to the hospital where Alistair tells Charlie that Tess had hypothermia and that he saved her. Later, Charlie purchases an old boat and asks Tess if she would like to take a ride with him. However, Tess fears him explaining that she had been having vivid dreams about them together.

This time a local police official, Inspector Simon, comes to call. The only conclusion Max can draw is that Carliss is somehow trying to frame him. His suspicions are correct. Carliss is not a Scotland Yard inspector at all but Gina's jealous ex-husband. He has arranged things to make Max appear guilty, and Simon, having the neighbor's eyewitness description of seeing Max's car, has little choice but to place Max under arrest. When it looks as though Carliss intends to harm Carol as well, Max escapes from jail. He manipulates Carliss into stealing his own car, and when the police give chase to the wrong man, Carliss, in a panic, drives over a cliff. Max's innocence becomes apparent to the police.

Abandoned by her husband, Amanda is forced to sell magazine subscriptions, but still considers herself superior to her working class neighbors. Concerned about her daughter, a shy loner who is training to be a secretary, but whose real interest is her collection of glass animal figurines, Amanda urges Tom to bring home a friend who might be interested in dating his sister. He finally relents and invites Jim O'Connor to dinner. Amanda is thrilled that her daughter finally will have a ""gentleman caller"" courting her. Determined to make a good first impression, she makes elaborate preparations for the meal, but complications arise when Laura learns the name of their expected guest, a boy she recalls was one of the most popular in high school. Feigning illness, she initially refuses to join everyone at the dinner table, but eventually Amanda encourages her to join the group, then arranges for Laura and Jim to be alone. Realizing she suffers from an inferiority complex, he draws her out of her shell by expressing interest in her collection and then persuading her to dance with him. Stumbling, Laura causes a glass unicorn to fall to the floor and lose its horn. At first upset by the damage, she realizes the loss of the horn makes the unicorn more like the horses and therefore less noticeable, as she feels she herself is because of her pronounced limp. Jim suggests he and Laura go to the Paradise Ballroom, and Amanda is delighted, until he mentions he is engaged to a woman named Betty. Laura gives him the broken unicorn and invites him to return some day with his fiancée, but after he leaves her devastated mother berates Tom for raising her hopes. Laura is more understanding and reminds her brother she loves him. Seemingly free of her limp and brimming with self-confidence, Laura awaits a visit from another ""gentleman caller"" in an upbeat ending that deviates from the play."

On March 2, 1896, the Italians embarked on the final European conquest of an African nation, Ethiopia. With brilliant military intelligence and gallant generals at the helm, united and willed, the Ethiopian people rose their way to triumph over the Italians at the Battle of Adwa. The event ignited a lasting flame of hope, of freedom and independence in the hearts of African people. Haile Gerima, the director and producer of this important historic landmark, joins the voices of Ethiopian historians, elders, priests, poets and singers, capturing on film the powerful education and experience that shaped his consciousness. In a collage of Ethiopian landscapes, paintings, photographs and faces, the film illuminates one of the hidden sources of African empowerment.

Her consciousness of life, morality and her own entity are intermingled with theater. The undaunted spirit places her above the nitty-gritty of daily life. She seeks emancipation through her medium of self-expression - the theater. Jhumur’s family included her mother, younger brother Chhorda , wife of her elder brother who are sympathetic with her sense of emancipation and also share with her joys and ambitions. Jhumur is professionally attached with a theater group named Nanarup. She also acts in another group in her locality in which Rajat  is the director. Apart from her professional attachment, Jhumur’s only refuge is her close proximity with Rajat, a theater director - already married and father of a daughter. From closeness to love or something beyond… Her love for life, theater, and Rajat become inseparable in such a way, she could not resist.. Rajat also seeks comfort in Jhumur's companion. The patriarchal society seems not to be tolerant with her sense of emancipation. It tries to delimit her within the conventional notion of womanhood. The inhabitants of the locality detest Jhumur's affinity with Rajat. The elders in the vicinity like Bhattacherjee or Mallickbabu are jealous about her. The youngers including local ruffians - Jaga, Patla and Buro use to tease her and even try to demean her publicly. Everyone is eager to snatch her freedom, she enjoys by engaging herself with theatre. They want to shatter her relationship with Rajat and teach a lesson. Incidentally, Rajat has to take the responsibility of directing a drama to be played in the annual function of the local club. Jhumur is in the role of a female lead. The local ruffians are also involved in collecting donations for the annual function, which Jhumur and Rajat detest. Everyone thinks - something has to be done. In the pretext of rehearsal, the ruffians took Jhumur to a wrong destination and raped her. Jhumur falls prey to the crime of the rapists. But who are the culprits? Is it the ruffians who committed the crime or the patriarchal society, who is the abater? The film seeks the question. There remains only one woman’s fight against conventional society. A fight - Jhumur’s own. Her armour - her challenge - the theater. ----

One of them, Jeannot, has the idea of putting the money together so the group can buy an old suburban wash house in ruins, that they will transform into a guinguette - a dancing and refreshment café in the country. They will be equal co-owners. They get down to realizing the project with confidence. But the solidarity of the group proves fragile. Soon enough the group is reduced to just Charles and Jean - who are in love with the same woman, Gina . The ending, judged too pessimistic, was re-made. ""Critics have associated the film with the rise and demise of the Popular Front. Duvivier was certainly not of the Left. The film was made in June and July 1936 and coincided with the early days of the Léon Blum government and the strikes calling for better conditions. It should be pointed out nonetheless that Duvivier's portrayal of male friendship gradually being eroded by a woman and by desire for that woman was canonical by 1936, so the film does not limit itself to that reading. If the men in Duvivier's film do not get to fulfil their dream of setting up their guinguette it is because, while economically they can be solidaires - as one, sexually they cannot.On a first level of reading, therefore, it is sex before politics that drives the narrative.""

In the soap, Fiz Brown receives bad news from her mother, Cilla, about her brother, Chesney, who had recently gone with her friend and ex-boyfriend Kirk to South Africa to see Cilla. Fiz arrives in South Africa to make sure that Chesney was safe. Fiz finds Chesney in a wheelchair but it soon becomes clear that Cilla had lied about Chesney's accident and that Chesney is not in fact injured. She is both relieved and angry, when they inform her this was all a scam to win a competition to find South Africa's best family. Fiz reluctantly agrees to participate when Chesney tells her that, if they win, Cilla has agreed to return to Weatherfield and be his mum. As part of the scam, Fiz is forced pretend to be a nun, Kirk poses as Cilla's mentally disabled son, and Cilla's boyfriend Lesedi pretends to be their stepfather. Fiz winds up falling for an AWOL South African soldier, Alex, who is working as a hotel security guard. He asks her to stay in South Africa with him, as he could not apply for a passport for fear of being court-martialed. Fiz agrees to stay in South Africa providing that Cilla will return to Weatherfield to look after Chesney. Unfortunately, Cilla has no intention of keeping her promise. When Chesney overhears her true plans, he ruins the prize ceremony by telling everyone of Cilla's lies. They are disqualified, and Cilla vanishes. A heartbroken Fiz had no choice but to tell Alex goodbye. She attempts, not very successfully, to convince him as well as herself that it had only been a holiday romance anyway. After one final kiss with Alex, Fiz returned to her life on the Street. In the closing moments, Cilla is crowned ""Worst Mom"" on South African television."

Britt's attitude changes when James is found dead from an allergic reaction to a bee sting. After the funeral, Britt fires the staff aside from his maid, but later re-hires Kato , James's mechanic and a skilled martial artist. Britt and Kato get drunk together and, upon agreeing that they both hated James, visit the graveyard to cut the head off James's memorial statue. After they succeed, they rescue a nearby couple being mugged. When police mistake Britt and Kato themselves for criminals, Kato evades them in a car chase as he and Britt return to the mansion. Britt convinces Kato they should become crime-fighters who pose as criminals in order to infiltrate real criminals, and to prevent enemies from using innocents against them. Kato develops a car outfitted with several gadgets and weapons, which they call the Black Beauty. Britt plans to capture Benjamin Chudnofsky , a Russian mobster uniting the criminal families of Los Angeles under his command, and whom his father was trying to expose. To get Chudnofsky's attention, Britt uses The Daily Sentinel as a vehicle to publish articles about the ""high-profile criminal"" the Green Hornet. Britt hires Lenore Case , who has a degree in journalism and a minor in criminology, as his assistant and researcher, and uses her unwitting advice to raise the Green Hornet's profile. Britt and Kato blow up several of Chudnofsky's meth labs, leaving calling cards so Chudnofsky can contact them. Throughout all this, The Daily Sentinel managing editor Mike Axford  fears this single-minded coverage will endanger Britt's life, and District Attorney Frank Scanlon  frets over public perception that he cannot stop the Green Hornet. Britt asks Lenore out, but she rebuffs him and instead invites Kato to dinner, making Britt jealous. Kato learns from her that mobsters often offer a peace summit to rivals in order to get close enough to kill them; Britt then tells Kato that Chudnofsky has offered them such a meeting. Kato tries dissuading him, but Britt, feeling overshadowed, follows his instincts. This nearly proves fatal when Chudnofsky tries to kill them. Barely escaping to the mansion, Britt and Kato argue and fight, and Britt fires both Kato and Lenore, whom he believes are in a relationship. Kato receives an email from Chudnofsky on the Hornet's calling-card email address, offering $1 million dollars and half of Los Angeles if he kills Britt. Meanwhile, Britt discovers Scanlon is corrupt, learning that he tried to bribe James into downplaying the city's level of crime in order to help his career. Scanlon invites Britt to meet in a restaurant, where he reveals he murdered Britt's father. Kato arrives, and instead of killing Britt attacks Chudnofsky's men, allowing him and Britt, whom Chudnofsky deduces is the real Green Hornet, to escape. At The Daily Sentinel, Britt intends to upload a recording of Scanlon's confession onto the Web — and belatedly discovers he did not manage to record it. Chudnofsky and his men, who followed the duo there, engage them in a firefight. Kato ultimately stabs Chudnofsky in the eyes with wood in self-defense and Britt shoots him to death. A SWAT team appears and fires at the Green Hornet and Kato, who use the remains of their nearly demolished Black Beauty to run Scanlon out the 10th-floor window, killing him. The Green Hornet and Kato flee to Lenore's house, where she learns their secret identities and that she has been the accidental mastermind behind the Green Hornet's plots. Despite being furious, she helps them hide from the police and tends to Britt's shoulder gunshot wound. The next morning, Britt promotes Axford to editor-in-chief and stages being shot in the shoulder by Kato, further establishing the Green Hornet as a threat and allowing Britt to get treated by professionals in a hospital. Later, the two weld James' stolen bust back onto his memorial statue. Now with Lenore to aid them, Britt and Kato vow to continue protecting the law by breaking it."

This man is Rip Porter, and he lives at the house with his wife Wendy Porter. The police say they are checking in on a domestic disturbance, and when they walk upstairs, they find Wendy injured by Rip's hand. They then arrest Rip, and he spends the next seven years in prison. It is unknown that if domestic assault was Rip's only crime, but he is an alcoholic and may have had a prior criminal record. Seven years later, Rip is released from prison and Wendy picks him up to take him home. Rip has changed in prison, he is now sober and has taken anger management courses. Not long after returning home, Rip talks to Wendy about starting a family. Wendy has kept a secret from Rip since he went to prison, and tells Rip of this secret; that she gave birth to a son after Rip went to prison, and Rip is the father. She tells him that she gave the baby up for adoption, and the couple who adopted him are the Campbells who live in Florida. Rip is immediately driven to regain custody of his son, and has a right to do so because he never signed the adoption papers. Jack and Molly Campbell enjoyed an idyllic life with Wendy and Rip's son, Joey, and love him very much. One phone call shatters their world when they learn that Rip Porter has just been released from prison and discovered a loophole in the adoption papers and now lays claim to his son. When a judge upholds Rip and Wendy's claim and Molly and Jack learn they must give Joey over to them, they are distraught at the fact that they can no longer keep the son they have raised. At first, Jack Campbell tries every legal avenue he can find. He speaks with a lawyer about the possibilities of keeping Joey, but his lawyer tells him that there is nothing he can do. Jack then contacts a congressman friend of his, but the congressman also tells him that his hands are tied and there is nothing he can do to help them. As a last resort, Jack travels to Ohio and tries to offer Rip money in exchange for Rip legally signing Joey over permanently to Jack and Molly. Rip refuses, and gets in a physical altercation with Jack. There are no charges pressed against Rip because Jack would also go to jail for violating the court order and for trying to bribe Rip. Jack and Molly have no choice but to allow Joey to visit his biological parents, Wendy and Rip Porter. Joey's first visit with Wendy and Rip goes exceptionally well. Rip has been working hard on preparing his home for Joey, and when Joey arrives, they work on building a tree house together. Wendy and Rip are grateful to have an opportunity to spend time with their son, and when Joey returns home to Jack and Molly, he excitedly tells them of his trip. However, Joey's second trip to Rip and Wendy's does not go well. After Rip's confrontation with Jack, he started drinking again, most likely due to the stress of the situation, he could no longer control his repressed alcoholism. Whenever Rip instructs Joey to go to the bathroom and take a shower, Joey refuses. Rip is at first patient, but Joey's constant refusal to wash up eventually causes Rip to lose his temper. He takes Joey to the bathroom forcibly, and while not intentionally doing so, he accidentally puts a bruise on Joey's arm. Before Joey leaves for Florida, Wendy tells him about making a wish by blowing on a dandelion, and Joey does so. After he leaves, Wendy tells Rip that she arranged to have Joey spend an extra week with Jack and Molly before he permanently returns to them. This upsets Rip, and in anger, he hits Wendy. When Joey returns home, he shows his bruise to Jack and Molly, and tells them what happened and they are very upset about this, and make a decision. Molly's sister and her husband had been inviting Jack and Molly to join them on a church mission trip to Haiti. Jack and Molly decide to take advantage of this invitation by telling Molly's sister that the courts have decided to send an investigative commission to the Porter's home before Joey can return there. Molly claims that a friend of Jack's, a congressman, has helped to arrange this. Molly's sister is suspicious of this, and calls the congressman. He proves her suspicions correct when he states that he has not helped Jack and Molly. Jack, Molly, and Joey travel to Haiti with Molly's sister and her husband. Jack has arranged for himself, Molly, and Joey to fly out of Haiti to another country, therefore running away from the possibility of having to send Joey back to the Porter's. However, Molly's sister called Allyson Bower, the child services agent in charge of Joey's case, and told her about the situation. The Haitian police force was notified and they stopped Jack before he could drive the family to the airport. The Campbells are returned to the United States and they meet with Allyson Bower. She tells them that Wendy Porter is there to see them. Before this, Rip and Wendy reconciled at their home. Rip felt tremendous regret for the way he had treated Joey and Wendy, and it is shown that he will continue to receive help and guidance for his alcoholism and anger problems, in the hope of becoming a better man. Wendy tells the Campbells that Rip never meant to hurt Joey, but that he is not ready to be a father. Jack apologizes to her for trying to bribe Rip and asks her to express his condolences to Rip. Ultimately, Wendy agrees to give Joey over to them permanently and signs a revised adoption paper, which Rip had also signed. They realize that the Campbells truly love Joey and cannot live without him even though he isn't biologically their child. Wendy and Rip still love him, but they realize that living with the Campbells is the best option for Joey right now, and as Wendy tells Joey goodbye, she expresses that she hopes that she and Rip can have a relationship with him when he grows older. They hug, and Joey returns to Jack and Molly. The last scene in the movie shows Jack, Molly, and Joey sailing on Jack's boat, with Joey steering.Plot Summary for ""Like Dandelion Dust"""

As a last resort, Jack travels to Ohio and tries to offer Rip money in exchange for Rip legally signing Joey over permanently to Jack and Molly. Rip refuses, and gets in a physical altercation with Jack. There are no charges pressed against Rip because Jack would also go to jail for violating the court order and for trying to bribe Rip. Jack and Molly have no choice but to allow Joey to visit his biological parents, Wendy and Rip Porter. Joey's first visit with Wendy and Rip goes exceptionally well. Rip has been working hard on preparing his home for Joey, and when Joey arrives, they work on building a tree house together. Wendy and Rip are grateful to have an opportunity to spend time with their son, and when Joey returns home to Jack and Molly, he excitedly tells them of his trip. However, Joey's second trip to Rip and Wendy's does not go well. After Rip's confrontation with Jack, he started drinking again, most likely due to the stress of the situation, he could no longer control his repressed alcoholism. Whenever Rip instructs Joey to go to the bathroom and take a shower, Joey refuses. Rip is at first patient, but Joey's constant refusal to wash up eventually causes Rip to lose his temper. He takes Joey to the bathroom forcibly, and while not intentionally doing so, he accidentally puts a bruise on Joey's arm. Before Joey leaves for Florida, Wendy tells him about making a wish by blowing on a dandelion, and Joey does so. After he leaves, Wendy tells Rip that she arranged to have Joey spend an extra week with Jack and Molly before he permanently returns to them. This upsets Rip, and in anger, he hits Wendy. When Joey returns home, he shows his bruise to Jack and Molly, and tells them what happened and they are very upset about this, and make a decision. Molly's sister and her husband had been inviting Jack and Molly to join them on a church mission trip to Haiti. Jack and Molly decide to take advantage of this invitation by telling Molly's sister that the courts have decided to send an investigative commission to the Porter's home before Joey can return there. Molly claims that a friend of Jack's, a congressman, has helped to arrange this. Molly's sister is suspicious of this, and calls the congressman. He proves her suspicions correct when he states that he has not helped Jack and Molly. Jack, Molly, and Joey travel to Haiti with Molly's sister and her husband. Jack has arranged for himself, Molly, and Joey to fly out of Haiti to another country, therefore running away from the possibility of having to send Joey back to the Porter's. However, Molly's sister called Allyson Bower, the child services agent in charge of Joey's case, and told her about the situation. The Haitian police force was notified and they stopped Jack before he could drive the family to the airport. The Campbells are returned to the United States and they meet with Allyson Bower. She tells them that Wendy Porter is there to see them. Before this, Rip and Wendy reconciled at their home. Rip felt tremendous regret for the way he had treated Joey and Wendy, and it is shown that he will continue to receive help and guidance for his alcoholism and anger problems, in the hope of becoming a better man. Wendy tells the Campbells that Rip never meant to hurt Joey, but that he is not ready to be a father. Jack apologizes to her for trying to bribe Rip and asks her to express his condolences to Rip. Ultimately, Wendy agrees to give Joey over to them permanently and signs a revised adoption paper, which Rip had also signed. They realize that the Campbells truly love Joey and cannot live without him even though he isn't biologically their child. Wendy and Rip still love him, but they realize that living with the Campbells is the best option for Joey right now, and as Wendy tells Joey goodbye, she expresses that she hopes that she and Rip can have a relationship with him when he grows older. They hug, and Joey returns to Jack and Molly. The last scene in the movie shows Jack, Molly, and Joey sailing on Jack's boat, with Joey steering.Plot Summary for ""Like Dandelion Dust"""

A Sicilian family depicted across three generations: from Cicco to his son Peppino to his grandson Pietro… Touching lightly upon the private lives of these characters and their families, the film evokes the loves, dreams and disappointments of an entire community in the province of Palermo over five decades: during the Fascist period, Cicco is a humble shepherd who, however, finds time to pursue his passion: books, epic poems, the great popular romance novels. In the days when people go hungry and during World War II, his son Peppino witnesses injustice by mafiosi and landowners, and becomes a communist. After the war, he encounters the woman of his life. Her family opposes the relationship because of his political ideas, but the two insist and get married, and have children. Subplots include one about a boy running an errand, a living fly locked inside a top, three rocks people try to hit in one throw, a man mutilating himself to avoid having to fight in the war, looting while the U.S. invades Sicily, making clothing from an American parachute, and Peppino's daughter calling her father a fascist for not allowing her to wear a mini-skirt. Running through the film however is the main subplot concerning the history of the Italian left especially the Communist Party of which Peppino is a life long member. It charts his fight against injustice and eventual disillusionment in the face of corruption and compromise by his fellow politicians.

Flashbacks telling the main story are framed by pieces of a conversation between government agent Marcus Santiago  and Colonel Gauge , the leader of Shadow Rock Securities International. At the beginning of the film, Santiago is seen briefing Gauge on his mission, which involved spying on the Just Rite Sugar Company, who are allegedly involved in some kind of plot involving an unethical Russian scientist as well as Shadow Rock Securities itself. A visibly shaken Santiago warns Gauge that Shadow Rock's leader, Colonel Briggs, is involved in the plot; however, once assured that Briggs has been detained and Gauge is now Shadow Rock's commander, he details his activities, which included planting wire taps and spying on the operations of Just Rite. Santiago berates himself for following his orders&nbsp;– to spy but not get involved&nbsp;– too closely, as he could have stopped the plan before it progressed to its current stage, which he claims could be the extinction of humanity. Prior to this, Just Rite security officials pursue an escaped girl, Hannah  through a seemingly abandoned mill, capturing and killing her before disposing of her body in a boiler. Just Rite CEO Braylon  meets with his security commander, Sykes  who informs him of the events at the mill. Braylon entrusts Sykes with cleaning up the situation, as some potential investors in his new sugar formula will be visiting the mill soon. It is revealed that Braylon intends to create a new type of sugar with an additive more addictive than crack cocaine and heroin combined, and to that end, he has hired Sergei  to conduct experiments in the mill. The men under Sykes's command were directed to abduct addicts and homeless people for Sergei's experiments, reasoning that nobody would be looking for such people if they disappeared. He is more enraged by Sykes's men accidentally abducting Ryan , the brother of Braylon's secretary Erin , in the course of abducting Hannah, than he is by Hannah's escape and death. It is revealed that previous batches of sugar devised by Sergei caused infections in their test subjects, and even though Hannah was previously designated ""status clear,"" Braylon and Sergei are confident she was an anomaly, as no other subjects from the most recent batch became infected. Ryan and Erin's father Griff , a Just Rite security guard dealing with alcoholism following his wife's death, discovers strange shipments being made to a supposedly abandoned sugar mill&nbsp;– which is also being observed by Santiago&nbsp;– and learns that Braylon has hired Shadow Rock to guard it independently of his usual security team. Meanwhile, Erin begins receiving strange e-mails at her desk from a mysterious figure calling themselves ""Cinderella."" Apparently a mole within Just Rite, Cinderella first sends Erin financial documents showing money being spent on the abandoned mill, then a photograph of Ryan in his holding cell. Together, Griff and Erin realize that Ryan must be at the mill, and resolve to rescue him. Sergei makes an ominous discovery&nbsp;– the latest batch of sugar, which was shipped out when it was verified clear, actually is infected as well, with the infection manifesting three months after ingestion. Upon receiving this news, Sykes gives up on the plan and decides to call in Shadow Rock's extermination team. Sergei pulls a gun, but Sykes kills him. Erin and Griff infiltrate the mill by hiding inside a truck. While roaming around searching for Ryan, they encounter Sykes and prepare for a confrontation. However, Sykes reveals that he is Cinderella and joins them, escorting them to Ryan's cell. While they are reunited, Braylon escorts his potential investors around the mill, proudly showing them some of the test subjects. He explains while showing them one failed subject that the infection in the previous sugar batches attacks the victim's brain and breaks down their body, a point made clear when he shows them the longest-surviving subject, whose body has melted in many places. However, when Braylon opens the door of a subject he believes is ""status clear,"" the subject is actually infected and attacks them. While one of Braylon's guards kills the infected subject, it is not before a security alarm is tripped that puts the entire mill on lockdown. This leaves Erin, Ryan, Griff and Sykes to escape through the ward where the most dangerous subjects are kept; meanwhile, Braylon and his investors escape and the investors flee, wanting no part of Braylon's plan. The Shadow Rock forces led by Gauge arrive at the mill and begin exterminating the infected. Erin, Ryan, Griff and Sykes manage to escape, but Sykes is shot and gets separated from the group in the confusion, and Ryan discovers that despite being ""status clear"" earlier, the boils characteristic of an infection have developed on his arm. Colonel Briggs  suddenly appears and begins killing Gauge's men after freeing the trapped Braylon. He ambushes Gauge and shoots him in the shoulder, and the two briefly exchange gunfire while discussing the internal coup Gauge staged against Briggs. Gauge gives up when his gun runs out of bullets and steps out, inviting Briggs to shoot him; however, Briggs discards his gun and rushes Gauge, allowing Gauge the chance to stab him in the stomach with his knife. Gauge then finishes the injured Briggs off with the bullet remaining in his gun's chamber. Ryan, Erin and Griff reunite with Sykes outside the mill, who reveals that he has rigged the entire mill with a self-destruct mechanism that he needs to be close to the building to activate. Revealing his infection, Ryan volunteers to drive the dying Sykes back into the mill. They successfully trigger the bombs before Ryan is killed by Shadow Rock's forces, and Braylon, watching his work go up in flames in dismay, is attacked and killed by an infected subject. Gauge, who escaped the explosion, salutes Griff and Erin for their work. He reveals Braylon's fate to them, then assures them that none of the infected subjects or sugar got out. However, in a final flashback, the last part of Santiago's transmission is revealed, in which he instructs Gauge to exterminate everything at the mill and then get ready to ""go hunting."" In an epilogue, people from all walks of life are seen consuming large quantities of Just Rite sugar. Everything appears normal until an elderly man being examined in a hospital appears to have the infection's boils on his body. As the doctor leaves the room, the view zooms out, revealing the entire waiting room filled with victims suffering from the infection."

Newly arrived teacher, Miss Lombardo grew up in the neighborhood but returned to be their Sing Leader. One cold Christmas night, Miss Lombardo is leaving a neighborhood party when a young man hails her a cab, then attempts to mug her. In self defense, she bites his hand to release his grip and he screams in pain and terror, quickly making an exit. The cab driver jokes about not starting the meter yet. On the first day of school, Miss Lombardo runs into difficulty when her students are uninterested and misbehaved. One such student was named Dominic who gets scolded for bringing stolen watches to school grounds and putting his feet up on the desk.

The school kids work hard to plan their Sing productions. Hannah and Dominic clash along the way as Hannah uses traditional Sing planning strategies while Dominic wants to introduce the flavor of the youth in the neighborhood. In order to put Dominic and Hannah on the same page, Miss Lombardo suggests that Hannah accompany Dominic to a local club. At first, the two are equally hesitant but Hannah agrees on the terms that it is not a date. However, by the end of the night, Hannah uses Dominic to make her ex boyfriend, Mickey, jealous, and due to this, Hannah and Dominic start seeing each other in a different light. Dominic accompanies Hannah on her walk home and the two share a romantic kiss. Once the two are finally uniting and getting along, the Dept. of Education informs the school that it will close its doors forever at the end of this semester and therefore, there will not be enough resources for them to complete this year's Sing. This fuels the kids to work even harder on their productions and the neighborhood comes together even more to help finance the show, despite the school authorities' ban. Ironically, just as things are starting to look up, Dominic reluctantly accompanies his brother on a robbery of Hannah's mother's diner, their sole source of income which already was at risk of failure due to the school's upcoming closure. A classmate saw Dominic standing outside the diner at the time of the crime and informed Hannah of what he saw. Devastated, Hannah confronts Dominic and he promises to get the money back for her. He then steals the money back from his brother and returns it to the diner, restoring Hannah's faith in him. The recent events had discouraged Dominic from fulfilling his co-Sing leader duties and he had been skipping out on rehearsals. In a moment of great need as the senior's main performer falls unconscious, Dominic steps in to save the show. He sheds his bad-boy demeanor and exceeds all expectations. The underclassmen and seniors perform to a record-high sold out audience. At the end of the show, Hannah makes a moving speech motivating the community to rejoice and always remember that despite compromising circumstances, they completed a successful Sing and proved their community's worth.

Hannah and Dominic clash along the way as Hannah uses traditional Sing planning strategies while Dominic wants to introduce the flavor of the youth in the neighborhood. In order to put Dominic and Hannah on the same page, Miss Lombardo suggests that Hannah accompany Dominic to a local club. At first, the two are equally hesitant but Hannah agrees on the terms that it is not a date. However, by the end of the night, Hannah uses Dominic to make her ex boyfriend, Mickey, jealous, and due to this, Hannah and Dominic start seeing each other in a different light. Dominic accompanies Hannah on her walk home and the two share a romantic kiss. Once the two are finally uniting and getting along, the Dept. of Education informs the school that it will close its doors forever at the end of this semester and therefore, there will not be enough resources for them to complete this year's Sing. This fuels the kids to work even harder on their productions and the neighborhood comes together even more to help finance the show, despite the school authorities' ban. Ironically, just as things are starting to look up, Dominic reluctantly accompanies his brother on a robbery of Hannah's mother's diner, their sole source of income which already was at risk of failure due to the school's upcoming closure. A classmate saw Dominic standing outside the diner at the time of the crime and informed Hannah of what he saw. Devastated, Hannah confronts Dominic and he promises to get the money back for her. He then steals the money back from his brother and returns it to the diner, restoring Hannah's faith in him. The recent events had discouraged Dominic from fulfilling his co-Sing leader duties and he had been skipping out on rehearsals. In a moment of great need as the senior's main performer falls unconscious, Dominic steps in to save the show. He sheds his bad-boy demeanor and exceeds all expectations. The underclassmen and seniors perform to a record-high sold out audience. At the end of the show, Hannah makes a moving speech motivating the community to rejoice and always remember that despite compromising circumstances, they completed a successful Sing and proved their community's worth.

SpongeBob's foghorn alarm spits out some more, and SpongeBob wakes up and stops them. SpongeBob remembers that, on this day, the Krusty Krab celebrates its ""eleventy seventh"" anniversary. He remembers his first visit to the Krusty Krab and tells Gary about it: Years ago, when SpongeBob's mother was still pregnant with him, she and SpongeBob's father went to the Krusty Krab to eat there. His mother asked him what he wanted , and he asked for a Krabby Patty. They were so good, SpongeBob took off his umbilical cord and sucked on it. When he finishes his flashback, SpongeBob showers, goes through the wringer, puts on his clothes and drinks a can of socks . He then puts on his shoes and goes over to the mirror, opens the door on it and looks through a collection of his faces. He takes off the one he already has on, and then replaces it with his ""eager face"". SpongeBob then leaves to go to the Krusty Krab, but as soon as he exits his house, he bumps into the back of an unbelievably long line of customers waiting to get to the restaurant as well. SpongeBob jumps on top of every second person in the line, then eventually reaches the Krusty Krab front door and squirms underneath it. Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob and Squidward that this is a perfect opportunity for his former best friend  Plankton to steal the Krabby Patty formula . Mr. Krabs has hired Patrick as a security guard, so that he does not have to pay for a real one. SpongeBob spectacularly decorates the Krusty Krab with ketchup, mustard and pink toilet paper. He then turns the Krabby Patties into balloons with an air pump, but then mentions that has one last decoration. Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs follow SpongeBob into the freezer where he shows them a giant Krabby Patty ice sculpture which he made himself. However, in attempt to take the ice sculpture outside, they accidentally knock SpongeBob out the open freezer door; he then rebounds off the kitchen door and back into the freezer. The impact shuts the door and it locks, trapping all four friends inside. While finding their way through air shafts, they look back at some memorable moments in their lives, including the first Krabby Patty commercial in which Krabs, baby SpongeBob and his parents played , the time Mr. Krabs first conveyed the Krabby Patty formula to SpongeBob while they travelled around the world, the day SpongeBob moved to Bikini Bottom , and also a time when SpongeBob and Sandy got married - which turned out to be a play without the priest knowing. . To get out of the air shaft, SpongeBob gathers Squidward, Patrick, and Mr. Krabs to bust out the shaft, but it takes a few tries, On his last try, he says to himself, OK, this is the one! Feel very good about this! OK, steady..., and he finally makes it out, only to find that all the customers have left after waiting for so long without getting any food. However, SpongeBob summons them all back as he sings a song in honour of the Krusty Krab, called ""Oh, Krusty Krab"" . Meanwhile, Plankton finally finds the perfect opportunity to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula. He fails, having Mr. Krabs to launch him, but Plankton tells Krabs that he cannot take any more launches, having been launched countless times by Krabs in the past.

He is separated from their mother Marambra, an unreliable and reckless woman suffering from alcoholism and bipolar disorder. Having grown up an orphan, Uxbal has no family other than his brother Tito, who works in the construction business. Uxbal earns a living by organizing work of illegal immigrants, a group of Chinese producing forged goods, and a group of African street vendors selling them. He is able to talk to the dead and is sometimes paid to pass on messages from the recently deceased at wakes and funerals. When he is diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer and is told to only have a few months to live, his world progressively falls apart. Uxbal initially begins chemotherapy, but later ends the treatment at the advice of his friend and traditional healer Bea. She also gives him two black stones which she asks him to give his children before he dies. The group of Africans are brutally arrested by the police despite Uxbal's regular bribes. As his friend Ekweme faces deportation to Senegal, Uxbal offers Ekweme's wife Ige and their baby son a room in his apartment. Meanwhile, an attempt at reconciliation with Marambra fails when Uxbal realizes she cannot be trusted to raise his children. Tito brokers a deal to put the Chinese to work at a construction site. However, almost all of them die while asleep in the basement of their sweatshop due to malfunctioning gas heaters that Uxbal provided to heat their clammy sleeping quarters. An attempt by the human trafficker to dump the bodies of the Chinese into the sea fails when they are washed up on the shore shortly after. As Uxbal's health continues to deteriorate, he is plagued with guilt that he is responsible for the death of the Chinese immigrants. As his death draws nearer, he realizes that there will be nobody to take care of Ana and Mateo once he is gone. He entrusts the remainder of his savings to Ige, asking her to stay with the children after his death. She accepts his request, but later decides to use the money to pay for her return to Africa. However, she changes her mind at the last minute and returns to the apartment.

His wealthy brother Josh  announces at the dinner table at their parents'  house that he has found Jamie a job as a pharmaceutical sales representative. After attending a Pfizer training program where he has sex with the instructor , Jamie goes to work for the company and tries to get doctors to prescribe Zoloft and Zithromax. He is rebuffed, much to the dismay of his regional manager, Bruce , who sees Jamie as his ticket to the ""big leagues"" of Chicago. Bruce says if Jamie can get Dr. Knight  to prescribe Zoloft instead of Prozac, other doctors will follow his lead. Jamie tries to get access to Dr. Knight by hitting on his female employees until, exasperated, Dr. Knight unethically permits him to observe a disrobing patient, Maggie Murdock , who suffers from early onset Parkinson's disease. Jamie angles a date with Maggie, who has sex with him. Jamie is later beaten up by top-selling Prozac rep Trey , one of Maggie's ex-lovers, who warns him to stay away from her and the doctors. That night, Jamie is unable to get an erection. Maggie teasingly says he should use the new erectile dysfunction drug that his company has developed.

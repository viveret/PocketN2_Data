One evening, while they are sitting in the restaurant, George introduces them to a young American named Andrew Larson . Andrew, who is a Mormon priest, is quickly attracted to Florence and gives her an ""admission card"" to a Mormon meeting. Although Florence cares greatly for Leslie , he often neglects her while pursuing other interests. Florence spends much time with the strangely fascinating American, enabling Andrew to indoctrinate her and convince her to go to Utah with him. Partly in passion and partly in hypnotic trance, Florence runs away and meets Andrew at the railway station. After her disappearance, her father searches her room and finds the note from Andrew asking her to come to the train. Leslie and George  inform the police of Florence's disappearance and the police notify the harbor patrol. With help from a Mormon friend, Andrew drugs Florence, then exchanges her hat and coat with another couple, enabling Andrew to sneak Florence aboard a steam ship heading for America. The harbor patrol detains the couple wearing Florence's clothes. When George and Leslie arrive to get Florence, the ruse is revealed, but the ship has already sailed. While on board, Florence has a change of heart and wants to return home. Andrew assures her that they will return home. A telegraph is sent to the ship about the kidnapping, but Andrew overpowers the telegraph operator before his plot can be revealed. The ship arrives in America and Andrew escapes with Florence to Salt Lake City where he locks her in a bedroom. George and Leslie leave aboard the next ship for America. Florence gains the sympathy of Andrew's first wife , but an attempt to set Florence free is unsuccessful when Andrew discovers it. One day, Andrew leaves home to perform a baptism at the Mormon temple. George and Leslie, having arrived in Salt Lake City, follow Andrew to his house. Andrew convinces them that Florence is elsewhere in the city. While the two race off on a wild goose chase, Andrew conceals Florence in a dark, dank cellar with a secret trapdoor entrance. Realizing that they were tricked, Leslie and George burst back into Andrew's house and search desperately for Florence, but cannot find her. Andrew continues to plead his innocence. By luck, Florence discovers the hidden button which opens the secret trap door to her cell. Leslie frees her and promises he will never again neglect her. Andrew pulls a pistol and tries to kill Florence. Leslie prevents him and during the ensuing struggle Andrew shoots himself and dies."

In Triplicane the next morning, Rajan , a radio engineer and communications researcher, is found murdered with his own hand gun. His neighbour Chinnaiah Pillai  hears the gunshot and complains to the police. A local Police Inspector named Purushothaman Naidu arrives and investigates the scene. He is joined by C.I.D. officer Sivanandam  there. He concludes that the killer is some petty thief who must have shot Rajan for the lump of money found in the same room of the crime scene. However, Sivanandam states that to be a bad solution, as the amount of money matches exactly with the withdrawal entry in the bank passbook found in the same room, without a single rupee's difference. Nonetheless, it was clear Rajan was making plans to leave Chennai in anticipation of the bombings. Rajan's wife Usha  is almost dumbstruck and unable to speak during any inquiries. Sivanandam and Naidu feel reluctant and embarrassed to do any questioning to her. The two decide to investigate the case by questioning the people in and around the house, who are the family members or friends of Rajan. They start their questioning with Chinnaiah Pillai, the neighbour, as he is the first to inform them. He tells that the killer could probably be Pattabi, Rajan's younger brother . He recounts an incident , in which Pattabi confronts Rajan at the house's garage to ask for his share of the family property to be apportioned and given to him. Rajan, in good faith, denies to give Pattabi his share, feeling that he and his wife might squander it. Chinnaiah concludes that this would have kindled Pattabi to kill Rajan. Sivanandam and Naidu decide to inquire Pattabi. However, Pattabi had rushed to the Beach before their arrival, probably to commit suicide. They rush there themselves to inquire him. When questioned, Pattabi feels remorseful of his brother's death. He states that he did not treat his brother well when he was alive and failed to understand his good intentions. He recounts another incident where his wife Hema, had fought with him herself, during dinner for the apportionment of the property. She is also a person who loses sanity when overpowered by anger. Pattabi believes it is easily possible that Hema used the Rajan's gun to shoot him for the money. Sivanamdam briefly parts Naidu, to meet Hema soon after, to do his inquiry. Hema was initially impudent and refusing to give her statement about the crime, but later gives in when threatened that her husband would be arrested for the same. She reveals a secret of Rajan. Rajan has had extramarital affair with a dancer named Ambujam . Only a week before the murder, she found this out when she stumbled upon and overheard Rajan and Ambujam conversing in some public place. During their conversation, Ambujam unveils that she is pregnant with Rajan's child. Rajan treats the news with a reckless attitude, infuriating Ambujam. Additionally, Hema had received a letter addressed to Rajan from Ambujam, that had the address ""No.15, Thoni Street"". Hema proposes that Ambujam could have killed Rajan in retaliation to Rajan's lack of concern for her. Fatigued with the case's complicated nature, Naidu compares it with a supposed ""Peruvala Vaikal"" in Trichy, a river that has a lot of twists and turns. Sivanandam makes a better analogy of the case, to the story of ""blind men and an elephant"", in which he states each suspect has a different and contrasting opinion to offer. In Thoni Street, Ambujam leaves her house, at the news of Rajan's death, to go out of town. Half-an-hour after her departure Sivanandam and Naidu arrive to find the house locked. They take with them Shanmugam, Ambujam's servant boy, to the Police Station and inquire him on the physical features of Ambujam, to locate and recognize her. But in a coincidence, Ambujam's bullock-cart and another bicycle strike each other in a road accident, right in front of the very same police station. They identify and inquire Ambujam. Ambujam accuses Chinnaiah  of the murder. She explains that Chinnaiah was her foster father, who wanted her to stay away from Rajan. She started loving him after the trio's meeting in a picnic. When their relationship started deepening, Chinnaiah got infuriated and wanted put an end to the affair. Ambujam gives a strong opinion that it must have been Chinnaiah who killed Rajan. Sivanandam does his homework by developing the film roll found in Rajan's camera, collecting and comparing all of the suspects' and others' fingerprints with those found in Rajan's shoes, finding a teardrop mark in Rajan's shoes and finding broken bangle pieces on the crime scene. He finds that they further complicate the case and the case comes to nowhere. He gets small clue at a sharbat shop, apparently making no sense. He make inquiries to Rajan's college  principal Ranganathan, who has a good opinion of both Rajan and Usha, his wife, both being his alumni. He says Rajan once broke into the college laboratory at night, to complete an experiment, for which he never felt guilty and also Usha once put up the Indian flag as part of Freedom Movement and she accepted doing it herself. This emphasizes her patriotism. Sivanandam finally inquires Usha. She narrates an incident during college where Rajan spoke of individualistic needs that are equally as important as the country's freedom. He managed to convince the entire crowd of his viewpoint, who previously opined in contrary. However, he was bullied and disdained when Usha took over and changed the crowd back to ""giving your life for the nation"". Usha further tells Sivanandam on how she and Rajan came to love each other. In the process, he tricks into collecting Usha's fingerprints with a leaky fountain pen. On that eve, Sivanandam meets all the suspects along with Naidu at Rajan's residence. He caries out an exercise wherein the suspects including Usha must shoot Sivanandam, assuming that he is Rajan. They are given revolvers with fake bullets. Everyone but Usha is able to shoot. Usha breaks down into tears and fails to shoot. Then Sivanandam orders an  arrest of Pattabi and Hema. Unable to bear the torture, Usha comes out with the truth. On the day of the murder, when she entered the room, she found Rajan working with something meticulously, with a radio equipment, powered by a generator. She doubts of something suspicious. The second time she enters she discovers that he is part of the terrorist activity that involves bombing Chennai. Rajan was indeed communicating to the Japanese bombers, the suitable time for the bomb to be dropped. He is the key part for their plans. Out of her extreme patriotism for her nation, and unable to bear the injustice she tries to talk and mend Rajan's ways. However, Rajan only wants to help the Japanese , and does not mind betraying his own country. Rajan has in fact, planned is to escape to Japan in a submarine after the bombing, for which he had packed the money. Usha unable to stop him in any polite way, attempts to shoot Rajan. However, she then changes her mind but the trigger is accidentally pressed killing Rajan. She has cried at his boots later, holding them, explaining the fingerprints and teardrop stain. Sivanandam and Naidu ask for the papers Rajan used to hatch the bombing plan. She goes inside to fetch them. Sivanandam tells Naidu that the Usha's fingerprints  and the ones on the boots matched, which led him to suspect her. Also, her failure to shoot during the exercise confirms the fact. When Usha takes a long time to come back, the two hear a moment's silence followed by a gunshot and they run inside. Sivanandam shouts ""Usha!"" followed by a screen closing behind them."

Additionally, Hema had received a letter addressed to Rajan from Ambujam, that had the address ""No.15, Thoni Street"". Hema proposes that Ambujam could have killed Rajan in retaliation to Rajan's lack of concern for her. Fatigued with the case's complicated nature, Naidu compares it with a supposed ""Peruvala Vaikal"" in Trichy, a river that has a lot of twists and turns. Sivanandam makes a better analogy of the case, to the story of ""blind men and an elephant"", in which he states each suspect has a different and contrasting opinion to offer. In Thoni Street, Ambujam leaves her house, at the news of Rajan's death, to go out of town. Half-an-hour after her departure Sivanandam and Naidu arrive to find the house locked. They take with them Shanmugam, Ambujam's servant boy, to the Police Station and inquire him on the physical features of Ambujam, to locate and recognize her. But in a coincidence, Ambujam's bullock-cart and another bicycle strike each other in a road accident, right in front of the very same police station. They identify and inquire Ambujam. Ambujam accuses Chinnaiah  of the murder. She explains that Chinnaiah was her foster father, who wanted her to stay away from Rajan. She started loving him after the trio's meeting in a picnic. When their relationship started deepening, Chinnaiah got infuriated and wanted put an end to the affair. Ambujam gives a strong opinion that it must have been Chinnaiah who killed Rajan. Sivanandam does his homework by developing the film roll found in Rajan's camera, collecting and comparing all of the suspects' and others' fingerprints with those found in Rajan's shoes, finding a teardrop mark in Rajan's shoes and finding broken bangle pieces on the crime scene. He finds that they further complicate the case and the case comes to nowhere. He gets small clue at a sharbat shop, apparently making no sense. He make inquiries to Rajan's college  principal Ranganathan, who has a good opinion of both Rajan and Usha, his wife, both being his alumni. He says Rajan once broke into the college laboratory at night, to complete an experiment, for which he never felt guilty and also Usha once put up the Indian flag as part of Freedom Movement and she accepted doing it herself. This emphasizes her patriotism. Sivanandam finally inquires Usha. She narrates an incident during college where Rajan spoke of individualistic needs that are equally as important as the country's freedom. He managed to convince the entire crowd of his viewpoint, who previously opined in contrary. However, he was bullied and disdained when Usha took over and changed the crowd back to ""giving your life for the nation"". Usha further tells Sivanandam on how she and Rajan came to love each other. In the process, he tricks into collecting Usha's fingerprints with a leaky fountain pen. On that eve, Sivanandam meets all the suspects along with Naidu at Rajan's residence. He caries out an exercise wherein the suspects including Usha must shoot Sivanandam, assuming that he is Rajan. They are given revolvers with fake bullets. Everyone but Usha is able to shoot. Usha breaks down into tears and fails to shoot. Then Sivanandam orders an  arrest of Pattabi and Hema. Unable to bear the torture, Usha comes out with the truth. On the day of the murder, when she entered the room, she found Rajan working with something meticulously, with a radio equipment, powered by a generator. She doubts of something suspicious. The second time she enters she discovers that he is part of the terrorist activity that involves bombing Chennai. Rajan was indeed communicating to the Japanese bombers, the suitable time for the bomb to be dropped. He is the key part for their plans. Out of her extreme patriotism for her nation, and unable to bear the injustice she tries to talk and mend Rajan's ways. However, Rajan only wants to help the Japanese , and does not mind betraying his own country. Rajan has in fact, planned is to escape to Japan in a submarine after the bombing, for which he had packed the money. Usha unable to stop him in any polite way, attempts to shoot Rajan. However, she then changes her mind but the trigger is accidentally pressed killing Rajan. She has cried at his boots later, holding them, explaining the fingerprints and teardrop stain. Sivanandam and Naidu ask for the papers Rajan used to hatch the bombing plan. She goes inside to fetch them. Sivanandam tells Naidu that the Usha's fingerprints  and the ones on the boots matched, which led him to suspect her. Also, her failure to shoot during the exercise confirms the fact. When Usha takes a long time to come back, the two hear a moment's silence followed by a gunshot and they run inside. Sivanandam shouts ""Usha!"" followed by a screen closing behind them."

In Triplicane the next morning, Rajan , a radio engineer and communications researcher, is found murdered with his own hand gun. His neighbour Chinnaiah Pillai  hears the gunshot and complains to the police. A local Police Inspector named Purushothaman Naidu arrives and investigates the scene. He is joined by C.I.D. officer Sivanandam  there. He concludes that the killer is some petty thief who must have shot Rajan for the lump of money found in the same room of the crime scene. However, Sivanandam states that to be a bad solution, as the amount of money matches exactly with the withdrawal entry in the bank passbook found in the same room, without a single rupee's difference. Nonetheless, it was clear Rajan was making plans to leave Chennai in anticipation of the bombings. Rajan's wife Usha  is almost dumbstruck and unable to speak during any inquiries. Sivanandam and Naidu feel reluctant and embarrassed to do any questioning to her. The two decide to investigate the case by questioning the people in and around the house, who are the family members or friends of Rajan. They start their questioning with Chinnaiah Pillai, the neighbour, as he is the first to inform them. He tells that the killer could probably be Pattabi, Rajan's younger brother . He recounts an incident , in which Pattabi confronts Rajan at the house's garage to ask for his share of the family property to be apportioned and given to him. Rajan, in good faith, denies to give Pattabi his share, feeling that he and his wife might squander it. Chinnaiah concludes that this would have kindled Pattabi to kill Rajan. Sivanandam and Naidu decide to inquire Pattabi. However, Pattabi had rushed to the Beach before their arrival, probably to commit suicide. They rush there themselves to inquire him. When questioned, Pattabi feels remorseful of his brother's death. He states that he did not treat his brother well when he was alive and failed to understand his good intentions. He recounts another incident where his wife Hema, had fought with him herself, during dinner for the apportionment of the property. She is also a person who loses sanity when overpowered by anger. Pattabi believes it is easily possible that Hema used the Rajan's gun to shoot him for the money. Sivanamdam briefly parts Naidu, to meet Hema soon after, to do his inquiry. Hema was initially impudent and refusing to give her statement about the crime, but later gives in when threatened that her husband would be arrested for the same. She reveals a secret of Rajan.

They quickly round up the rest of the gang, and follow the moving van to its destination. The fire truck's owner, a snobbish rich kid named Jerry, comes out to find a dozen strange children playing with his fire engine and shoos them all away, refusing to trade any sorts of collateral  for even a ride. When Wally's girl Jane turns up, however, Jerry is quick to offer her a ride. Wally tries to dissuade Jane from riding with Jerry by telling her that the gang has a fire engine of its own, big enough to hold all of them. Jane agrees to a ride with Wally in his fire engine after she gets back from her ride with Jerry. Wally, Stymie, and the gang quickly begin building a makeshift fire engine of their own, ""borrowing"" wheels, hoses, plywood, and other raw materials from around the neighborhood. As the older kids work on the fire engine, little Spanky and Scotty find themselves forced out of the proceedings, and sit on the sidelines giving commentary on the building process. Unknown to the kids, Jerry sneaks over to the gang's barn with Jane, hoping to prove the gang does not have a fire engine. He quickly ends up running away, however, when a drill from the other side of the barn door relieves him of his pants. The unwieldy results of their labor fail to impress Jane, whom Jerry successfully coaxes into another ride with him. The gang follows them, and Jerry challenges them to a race to the bottom of a steep hill. Not long after the start of the race, the gang's fire engine loses its brake  and Jerry fears that the gang might very well run him over. Halfway down the hill, he leaps out of his fire engine into a lawn, leaving Jane alone to crash in the next yard over. While the gang cheers in victory, their fire engine suddenly veers onto the sidewalk, where they knock over several pedestrians and ride straight through a hedge, which tears their clothes and causes them to emerge from the other side in their underwear."

Back in class, Miss Lawrence calls on the children to recite their recitations, but it turns out that Alfalfa is the only one willing to recite. He stands to recite ""The Charge of the Light Brigade,"" revealing the firecrackers in his back pocket. Using the magnifying glass, Porky trains the light on Alfalfa's pocket, setting off the firecrackers so that by the time Alfalfa reaches the ""Cannons to the left of me/Cannons to the right of me/Volleyed and thundered"" verses of the poem, the poor boy's backside is on fire. Alfalfa runs around the classroom and then outside where he puts his rear out in a washtub full of cold water.

They are in their 20s and working low paid blue collar jobs and occasional small criminal offenses like selling marijuana or illegally providing liquor for parties. They cook up a scheme to make extra money that involves prostitution. They start with two prostitutes then the business gets bigger with more girls. They find some drug dealer, named Nate, with a low price but as they get richer, Nate gets more expensive. One night Chris and Sienna meet with an old client who likes Sienna. Both smoke crack, and he kills her. The police arrive and arrest him and Chris. He is involved in several crimes that include prostitution, drug-dealing, possession etc. He could face 10 years in maximum state prison. Brian arrives to jail to visit Chris, who tells him that the cops will reduce his sentence to two years minimum, if he tells them where he got the drugs from. Brian tries to convince Chris that if he does this, Nate will hunt him down, but Chris doesn't care. Meanwhile, Brian gets addicted to cocaine. Brian plans to kill Chris with an old man in jail who sticks a knife in his stomach but does not kill him. Chris tells the police of Brian's drug business. His other friends tell him that they are not going to be involved in the business anymore with Chris in jail and Sienna dead, so they go. Darick is killed by the drug-dealer Nate and Brian tries to kill Kevin unsuccessfully. Kevin took a plane out of the country, with his girlfriend catching up with him later, having been shot by Brian in an attempt to kill the couple. She goes to the hospital and catches the next flight. The police then raid Brian's house. Brian burns all of his drug money and tries to flush the drugs down the toilet, but the cops turn off the water supply, knowing Brian is planning on getting rid of the drugs. A helicopter surrounds his house and they order Brian to surrender. Brian grabs his M16 and fires at the helicopter. A shootout with Brian and the cops occurs. Out of bullets, Brian runs to his bedroom to grab his pistol. He calls his mother and apologizes for the lifestyle he chose. She sees him on the news. Brian walks outside, with a gun in his hand. Cops order him to drop the weapon or they will shoot. Brian surrenders, but when he is trying to drop his guns, Nate, with a sniper rifle, shoots and kills him so Brian won't tell the cops who gave him the drugs. The police, amazed, didn't see who kills him. In the end of the movie Brian's mother is shown in the cemetery with Eddie and Chris who is still incarcerated and uses a wheelchair. Kevin and his girlfriend are somewhere away from the US, but still send letters to Eddie. Finally, in Eddie's thoughts, he says that he didn't want to be involved in the beginning of the business because they reached a very high point but finally went to a bridge to nowhere.

The police term it the Manmatha Raja case, and it receives wide media coverage. A man's likeness is also broadcasted. Upon seeing that, two more girls realize that they have also been cheated by the same man, but are unwilling to believe it. On a separate track, Panchamruta aka Panche  is travelling in a bus. The bus meets with an accident and Panche is admitted to the hospital. A policeman ties Panche's face to that of the accused in the Manmatha Raja case and Panche is arrested. Panche's case receives widespread attention, and it finally comes before the judge . The judge's daughter Pooja , a law student who's one of the girls cheated by Manmatha, obtains permission to watch the proceedings. The judge or judge-amma as Panche begins to call her, begins the proceedings by offering a court appointed lawyer for Panche's defense. Panche refuses, and says he will represent himself. The first witness in court is Rekha Vijay Mittal . She recounts, she found a mobile at a parking lot which turns out to belong to Vijay Mittal . Vijay talks to her in English, and asks her to hang on to the mobile, as he's flying to London. Rekha, impressed by him and his wealth, agrees. Vijay comes to Bangalore, and meets Rekha and her brother. Her brother is in the construction business and wants Vijay to help him move things with a strict politician. Vijay says that the politician expects 25 lakhs in bribes in a briefcase and call it a file. They do so, and the politician who is unaware of the existence of the bribe money, takes it. Rekha wants to marry Vijay, but according to his friend Johnny Walker , he has prior commitments to marry an Englishwoman. Vijay however agrees to a quick wedding, and they get married. Vijay doesn't let them get photographed either. The next day, Vijay has run away from the house taking all the valuables with him. The money they had given to the politician is also gone, as Vijay has changed briefcases soon after. Rekha now says that Panche is Vijay Mittal. Panche argues that she has no proof at all that a wedding happened. He also suggests that the judge jails Rekha's brother on bribery charges as they have publicly accepted it. The public prosecutor has no choice but to accept Panche's arguments. In the mean time, Pooja is quite impressed with the arguments of Panche. She tells him so when he is being taken away, and she tells him that she knows that he is not Panche but Zakir Hussain , who cheated her out of a painting she paid one lakh for. Panche disagrees strongly. The next witness is the Telugu girl Shanti/Telugu Pilla/Bangaru . Shanti is obsessed with films, and she in uninterested in the man she is engaged to marry as he isn't heroic enough. She once meets a man wearing the Krissh face mask, and riding a bike on a single tyre. She is impressed with his heroism. He tells her his name is Khush  and he gives her his mobile so she can contact him. Johnny Walker calls her instead, and lets her know that he's really Samarasimha Reddy, hailing from a Rayala Seema royal family and in filmy style has got rid of all his enemies. This impresses her further and she runs away with him with all her valuables. He builds a shack for them in Dil style, and marries her by exchanging flower garlands. Just when they're about to have their nuptials, he makes off with all the gold she's brought with her. In a fit of anger, Shanti has thrown away the mangalasutra he tied her. Now she accuses that Samarasimha Reddy is in fact Panche. Panche says he is not, and says that even this girl has no proof to accuse him and that the story itself was like a combination of four films. Shanti is extremely irritated, but she has no choice but to step down. In the meantime, a man named David Fernandes Shridhar claims that Panche is really his brother Joseph . David had a failed marriage, and his wife, who is frustrated with David's poverty leaves with another man. Deeply affected by that Joseph takes to crime and unjust behaviour, and substantiates all his doings with unarguable logic. And one day, David gets irritated enough with Joseph that he throws him out of the house. Panche listens to all this and disagrees. He says he was born and brought up a Hindu, and also says that he is from Mangalore. The police find that the story he has told them about his mother is true. A DNA test between David and Panche comes back negative. The fourth witness is Radha Bai  who claims that Panche deceived them in the guise of Shri Shri Bhagwan Rajneesh . He calls himself an incarnation of Lord Krishna, and has come to the ashram of Radha Bai to marry Rani , her daughter and take her to heaven. Under the influence of the drugs he has fed them in the name of theertha, both Radha bai and Rani happily agree. He plies them with enough ramarasa for them to lose senses, and makes off with all their money. Panche ridicules them for their foolishness and also makes fun of the fact that Rani wanted to get married to a god. The public prosecutor has no counter-arguments here either. In the meantime, the police find Johnny Walker. Johnny says that he was bribed by a man like Panche to call all the women in question, but he is unable to convincingly tell them that Panche was indeed the man. The last witness is the industrialist Monica , who says she had a secretary called Shyam Prasad , who helped her realize that she was missing something without a marriage. She was a divorcee, divorced from her husband because she was a self-satisfied woman. She falls for Shyam and even announces their wedding, but Shyam walks away. She talks for Panche, and says he shouldn't be jailed. The judge listens to all these arguments and says that she has nothing on Panche, so he is free to go. Panche leaves, and men with the likeness of Shyam, Samarasimha, Rajneesh, Vijay who're present in the crowd also leave and everyone follows them. But, it turns out that these are all different men, all related to the girls, wearing wigs. And Panche is really David's brother Joseph who has been playacting with the girls to make them realize their mistakes and accept the men  who love them. He explains that after he left David's house, he found that his sister in law committed suicide. He then decides to help these women by making them realize that their greed for different things is foolish. Along with the end credits, we are shown how Panche/Joseph falsified various evidences like the DNA sample.{{cite web}}

One evening, Nandita encounters Prithvi , an aspiring artist who is in search of his masterpiece. Prithvi tells Nandita that he made a sketch 4 months ago of a girl, who is actually Nandita. He also shows her a painting where she is lying with her wrist slit. He warns her of any type of danger. Regardless, Nandita accidentally slits her wrist due to an unknown ghostly attack on her in the bathroom. Prithvi saves her and admits her to a hospital. Yash arrives to the hospital and comes to know about her pregnancy and also her miscarriage due to excessive bleeding. She complains to Yash about Prithvi, and Yash gets him arrested, though he is released later on. Meanwhile at Kalindi, the same American, David Cooper , who is the Kalindi chemical plant owner, commits suicide by hanging himself after writing on the wall of his room, ""Tum ashudh ho, andar sey sadh chuke ho"" ,with his blood. The inspector investigating the suicide is severely affected by it. Back at his home, Prithvi makes another picture of Nandita getting mobbed. He runs to a fashion show where Nandita is performing, and witnesses her being possessed and attacking a spiritual guru attending the show. She then says the same lines, ""Tum ashudh Ho, sadh chuke ho"", to the guru. Prithvi rushes to her rescue, but is prevented by the guards. Nandita is taken away from the guru and audience. The guru later appears on TV, claiming she had been possessed. Coming to know about everything, Yash has her publicly apologise to everyone, and declares that she has mental problems. After the guards release Prithvi, Nandita is possessed again in her bathroom, with same lines appearing in the mirror. She goes to Prithvi for help, but he refuses her, showing her a new painting in which she is hanging herself and the same lines seem to appear behind her. He also shows her some news clippings about the death of the priest and David Cooper, with the same lines written behind them. Nandita thanks him and leaves to attend a party with Yash. There she is possessed and attacked again, and starts bleeding. Meanwhile, Prithvi prepares himself to help Nandita by burning the ominous painting of Nandita, which symbolises that he will protect her.

He tries to stop her, but realizes that she is possessed. She then tries to commit suicide but he prevents her from doing so. Yash arrives to find Nandita in Prithvi's arms.

She receives visions of people hanging from trees. She then spots a well and somebody standing near it, and goes towards them. Just as she is about to jump, Prithvi catches her. It is revealed that the 'well' was actually the steep edge of a cliff. They arrive at Kalindi and meet the priest's wife  who tells them that it was her husband who was evil and his death was not surprising, considering the crimes he had committed against innocent people in the name of religion. They decide to go to the police inspectors' house , where they find him completely crazy and are unable to prevent him from committing suicide. Nandita and Prithvi soon continue their journey by jeep. One night while traveling, they are attacked by animals. Nandita escapes the jeep and heads towards the trees, where she finds the same well. This time, before Prithvi can save her, she jumps into it. Prithvi follows her. Inside the well, Nandita comes to know that it was Prithvi's father, Veer Pratap Singh , who was possessing her. It so happened that he discovered that the Kalindi chemical plant dumps its toxins into a lake where thousands gathered once a year to bathe in a sacred ritual. He lodges a complaint against David Cooper but is warned by the policeman and the priest against taking any action, or his life will be in peril. He merely replies, ""Tum ashudh Ho, sadh chuke ho"". Veer Pratap tries to tell the truth to everyone, but is killed by the goons of the priest and his body is dumped in the same well. His spirit returns for his revenge. He kills David Cooper, and the policeman and priest who sided with David. Prithvi finally learns the truth, but is still confused as to why Nandita was used for this. They come to know that it was Yash who had all the proof of Veer Singh's death, but he had sold those proofs to David in return for sponsorship of his show. Nandita tries to escape with the proof but is just about shot by Yash, when Prithvi saves her. Unfortunately for both, Prithvi is stabbed by Yash. In the end however, the spirit of Veer attacks and kills Yash. Before moving on, Veer heals Prithvi's wounds after which Nandita and Prithvi are reunited."

The main danger is from U-boats and aircraft. David is pleased to be reunited with an old friend, Captain Chris Ford . Chris takes him out on a mission, then brings him home to his flat to meet his lover Stella . She had been engaged to Philip, another tugboat captain, but he was killed the day before their wedding. Knowing the extreme danger of his job, Philip had given a copy of his key to the flat to another officer, Van Barger , so that Stella would be taken care of no matter what. Van Barger moved in. Then, continuing the tradition, he gave a key to Chris. When Chris chooses David to be the next in line, David tries to refuse, but his friend is insistent. Stella accepts Chris's marriage proposal. However, she has a premonition that he won't be coming back from his next mission. She is proved correct. At first, David refuses to move in, but eventually does so. To his surprise, she does not share his bed immediately, but as time goes by, Stella falls in love with him, unlike the others. She puts away her photograph of Philip, gets rid of the uniforms of David's predecessors, and takes off her wedding ring. She also leaves her flat for the first time since Philip was killed. Finally, she asks David to marry her and he gladly accepts. With the U.S. entry into the war, an American freighter becomes David's next assignment. The inexperienced crew sends out a continuous S.O.S., contrary to sealed orders, revealing the ship's position to the enemy. When David finds out the situation, he tries unsuccessfully to refuse what amounts to a suicide mission. Just as he is about to depart, another tugboat returns. Knowing his chances, he gives his key to its captain, Kane . David's tug is attacked by a U-boat and set afire. He orders the crew to abandon ship, then rams the submarine. After being rescued, David hurries back to the flat, but Kane is already there, having told Stella that David was killed. When she sees him alive, she screams at him to get out, hurt to the core by his betrayal in passing on the key. Later, Kane finds David drinking his sorrows away and informs him that Stella is leaving for London on the train.

Power  lives with his Aunt Joanie  and is always shown air-drumming to music, even when at work. It turns out he air-drums because his father never could afford to buy him drums. He does his air-drumming at a talent show in a local bar, where his only praise comes from a young boy. Unfortunately, the mining plant is poised to strike, but Power is fired for a mishap that is one too many just beforehand, therefore he cannot join in. Disappointed, he stumbles upon an ad for an underground air-drumming place about forty miles south of them just across the border in Mexico. The boy lends him his dirt bike to get there, but he ends up losing it while there. He joins in, playing a Rush song without sitting down, which makes him nearly pass out. When the police raid the place, he ducks everyone and gets away. Before heading back, he is given an invitation to join a group of air-drummers in Newark, New Jersey, so armed with his music and cereal, he hitchhikes his way to Newark. Once he gets there, he meets the crew, headed by Carlos, a former drummer who now has hooks in place of both of his hands , and he is given a job and a place to crash at a local Chinese restaurant owned by Michael Fong . Living upstairs from the restaurant is Samantha, a religious fanatic, and her hearing-impaired daughter, Annie . Annie does take an initial liking to Power, but her mother objects to it, and even eventually threatens to move to Florida when she catches them making out. Before doing so, Annie reveals that her mother used to be a groupie, and she went deaf in her youth from not wearing hearing protection while on stage with the bands.  A subplot involves a rich young guy called Dallas Houston  who does music videos and has his own product lines of every sorts. He has a secret admiration for air-drumming that his father, who happens to own the mining company that runs the Lode plant, abhors. Power works hard with the new crew for the upcoming air-drumming competition, eventually overcoming his shortcomings, but when he finds out the striking miners were assaulted by hired thugs and his dad is hospitalized, he bails on them and calls him, and they seem to make amends. Carlos decides the group must go on without Power, but as they are performing their group song, one of the members is disqualified for how he’s playing, which causes the others to start a fight and gets them DQed as well. Power, who comes in just in time for the solo competition, is the only one left eligible on their team. He plays along with Dallas H. and another female to Tom Sawyer in the finals. The girl drops out early, and after Power’s defective stool breaks and leaves him flat on the floor, it seems as though he would be out as well. However, he finds out Annie is in the crowd at the show when she tosses a Cheerio on stage right into his mouth.  With renewed energy, Power jumps up and continues playing without a stool  and outlasts Dallas to win the competition. He is presented the $2000 grand prize by Rush drummer Neil Peart  and has him make the check out to the workers union of the copper plant. Power’s dad, renewed by his son’s victory and generosity, helps to resume fighting.

Shanti arrives at Disha's home, wanting to confront her about Manav. She meets Disha's mother and asks for Disha. Disha's mother reveals the twist: Disha has been dead for 22 years. Stunned, Shanti runs away and is pursued by Disha's spirit, finally collapsing on the highway. When she awakens, she finds herself at the home of a noted astrologer and seance medium named Sunita Menon , surrounded by the rest of her friends. First Sunita performs a seance that invokes Amar's spirit but there is no such spirit then she invokes Disha's spirit. The spirit works through Sunita's body and angrily exclaims its quest for the death of the kids. Talli realizes that the secret is in the book, and runs off to retrieve it. He reads the book and learns that this is all about Krishna Cottage.So he goes there is murdered by Disha. The friends then find that the professor Das has burnt the last few pages of the book and has also been killed by the spirit. The friends figure out it has something to do with a place at a nearby hill station. They rush there and Manav discovers a body preserved in ice. The body bears an uncanny similarity to him; this brings back a flood of visions: Manav was in fact, Amar Khanna in his previous birth. He recalls himself and Disha as students of JC College many years ago. Disha was madly in love with him, but he turned her down because he thought of her as a friend. Angry, Disha committed murders and framed Amar for it. However, Amar found the murder weapon in Disha's car. Disha crashed the car into the side of the mountain, instantly killing them both. The professor and the principal were witnesses to Amar and Disha's death. Disha has now returned as a spirit to reclaim her lost love. Sunita suggests the only way to stop Disha: Manav and Shanti must be married , as this bond is too strong for a spirit to break. The wedding ceremony commences that night, and Disha's spirit attacks the ceremony, killing Sunita Menon. Manav then agrees to go with Disha's spirit, but informs it that while the spirit may claim his body and soul, his heart and destiny belong to his wife Shanti. This finally appeases the spirit and liberates it. The film ends with Manav and Shanti happily married.

The impulsive midwife Gulabi  is the protagonist, whose one passion is the cinema. She leads a lonely life in an island inhabited by fisher folk. Her husband Musa , a small-time fish-selling agent, has deserted her and is living happily with his second wife Kunjipathu and their child Adda. A family gifts her a television with a satellite dish antenna in gratitude after she attends to a difficult delivery . The arrival of the first color TV in her small island village heralds great changes in the sleepy hamlet. The women in the village begin gathering at her house once the men leave for fishing. But a few of them stay away, since Gulabi is one of the few Muslims in the village. Yet others prefer to watch from outside her shack, without entering it. Among the regulars at her home is Netru , a girl with an absentee husband and a domineering mother-in-law, whom Gulabi befriends and becomes a confidante to. But Netru disappears and Gulabi is blamed, leaving her all alone in the village. The Kargil War of 1999 and the rise of communalism in Karnataka provide the backdrop to the film. The communal stereotyping of Muslims following the Kargil War finds an echo in the village. The tension between the small fishermen of the village and a Muslim businessman  with a growing fleet of commercial trawlers acquires a communal colour. The disappearance of Netru adds to the mounting tensions. The Muslims in the village flee and urge Gulabi to leave too, but she refuses and stays put in the village. Her house is vandalised and she is forcibly taken to a boat to leave the island. The young men from outside who spearhead the attack assure the villagers that Gulabi's television would remain in her house. The film ends with a scene in which two illiterate elderly women, who had hitherto refused to enter Gulabi's house, going in there to watch TV .

Lukas Sadorov is a Templar and a former Speznas who deserted the Soviet army following a massacre on civilians in Afghanistan, sent by the head of his order to recover the key. After a lot of insistence, Karen tags along with Lukas and eventually gains his trust, and after having seen the Minion in action, she decides to aid him in his quest by proposing to hide the key in a nuclear waste depository built on the grounds of her childhood reservation home, whose resident radioactivity would theoretically prevent the Minion's host bodies from claiming the key. She enlists the help of her grandfather, Michael Bear, a Mohawk shaman who works as a foreman at the depository plant, in order to gain access to the facility. However, the Minion repeatedly takes over people who unwittingly come into contact with his previous, if disabled host bodies, enabling him to continue his relentless pursuit. He finally takes possession of Karen's former archeology tutor, Professor Schulman, who is providing assistance to the NYPD during the investigation of the apparent serial murder case, and tricks the police into opening a manhunt on Lukas.

When he tries to get back in after the gates have been closed, he is restrained by four guards. The gates suddenly start to curl in towards the group, as though attracted by a magnetic force; the boy is then knocked unconscious by another guard. In present day, a girl named Marie  is studying with her boyfriend at her house in Meridian, Mississippi. They hug together and they kiss, which knocks him out and he almost dies. She screams as her mother arrives. Terrified, she decides to leave her home. In Congress, Senator Robert Kelly attempts to pass a ""Mutant Registration Act"", which would force mutants to publicly reveal their identities and abilities. Magneto begins his plans to level the playing field between mutants and humans. Meanwhile, Marie, now going by the name of Rogue meets Logan, also known as Wolverine, at the local bar in Canada. Rogue's mutation makes her temporarily assume the powers of any mutant she touches, while Wolverine possesses superhuman healing abilities, heightened senses, and metal claws that extend outwards from his knuckles. Suddenly, both of them are attacked by Sabretooth, a fellow mutant and an associate of Magneto. Cyclops and Storm arrive and save Wolverine and Rogue, and bring them to the X-Mansion, a facility run by Professor Charles Xavier, who leads a group of mutants who are trying to seek peace with the human race, educate young mutants in the responsible use of their powers, and stop Magneto from starting a war with humanity. Abducted by Mystique and Toad, Senator Kelly is brought to Magneto, who tests a machine on Kelly that artificially induces mutation, though Kelly manages to escape imprisonment with his new abilities. After an accident causes Rogue to use her powers on Wolverine, she is convinced by Mystique (disguised as classmate [[Iceman  that Xavier is angry with her and that she should leave the school. Xavier uses Cerebro to locate Rogue at a train station. Mystique infiltrates Cerebro and sabotages the machine. At the train station, Wolverine convinces Rogue to stay with Xavier, but a fight ensues when Magneto, Toad and Sabretooth arrive to take Rogue. Arriving at Xavier's school, Kelly dissolves into a puddle of water when his mutation becomes unstable. The X-Men learn that Magneto was severely weakened in the test of the machine on Kelly, and Wolverine realizes he intends to use Rogue's ability to transfer his powers to her, so that she can power his machine in his place, possibly putting her life at risk. Xavier attempts to use Cerebro to locate Rogue, but falls into a coma, due to Mystique's earlier meddling with the device. Jean Grey fixes it and uses Cerebro to find Magneto's machine on Liberty Island, which Magneto intends to use on the world leaders, who are meeting for a summit on nearby Ellis Island. Just as the group arrives at the top of the statue, defeating Toad and incapacitating Mystique, Magneto and Sabretooth incapacitate the group and continue with their plans. Magneto transfers his powers to Rogue , who is forced to use them to start the machine. Wolverine breaks free and initiates a fight with Sabretooth, but is thrown off the top of the statue. Wolverine returns, and Cyclops, with Jean's help, blasts Sabretooth out of the statue. With Jean's telekinesis stabilizing him, Storm uses her abilities to send Wolverine to the top of Magneto's machine. With time running out, Wolverine attempts to stop the machine and save Rogue, but Magneto, now having regained some of his strength, halts Wolverine's claws. Cyclops manages to find a clean shot, wounding Magneto and allowing Wolverine to destroy the machine. Placing his hand to Rogue's face, as she is dying, Wolverine succeeds in transferring his regenerative abilities to her; Professor Xavier also recovers from his coma. The group learns, after seeing Mystique impersonating Senator Kelly on a news broadcast, that, despite being stabbed by Wolverine at Liberty Island, she is still alive. In an attempt to help him learn more about his past, Xavier sends Wolverine to a military base near Alkali Lake. Xavier visits Magneto in his plastic prison cell, and the two play chess. Magneto warns his friend that he will continue his fight, to which Xavier promises that he and the X-Men will always be there to stop him."

He parks his car in the middle of the road and makes trouble for other vehicles. A traffic policeman, Kandadasamy , ignores that violation because he is a close friend of Sathya. A social activist and lawyer, Udhayamoorthy , drags both of them to court for obstructing traffic and causing a nuisance. Instead of sentencing them, the court sends them to the Madurai Gandhi Museum for help, where they meet a college student named Meenakshi . After he is discharged, Sathya starts a job as a henchman. VBR , a villainous former minister, sends him to steal a confidential file containing vital evidence on the death of the collector Sukanya at Udayamoorthy's place. While he is stealing the file, Udayamoorthy is killed by Sathya. While dying, Udayamoorthy blesses Sathya by saying ""Vazhga Valamudan"" . These last words haunt Sathya, and, filled with remorse, he vows to carry on Udayamoorthy's good work. He gathers evidence to discover the murderer of Sukanya, even as VBR burns the documents to destroy the evidence. Sathya continues with his task of exposing VBR, and adopts Gandhian principles of nonviolence and peaceful satyagraha. Ezhumalai  is a police inspector who vows to avenge the death of his brother, Udhayamoorthy. He thinks that Sathya had killed him, although he later finds out that he didn't. Sathya sits near the Gandhi statue and follows his examples of non-violence, confident that VBR will be arrested. VBR surrenders himself to police and is arrested. The film ends with Sathya and Meenakshi."

They are happy with each other, but do not believe in tying each other down so, when career beckons, they have a mutual break-up, but decide to remain friends. Meera goes to India, while Jai stays in England, hoping to be called to San Francisco, where working at the Golden Gate is his dream job. Jai begins to date a blonde named Jo, while Meera returns the feeling of her boss, Vikram. The couple believe they have moved on. Running side-by-side, but in a different time, is the tale of Veer Singh. A great believer of love, the Sikh narrates his love story to Jai to try to convince him not to let Meera go to India. He tells how he fell for a girl called Harleen, who moved to Calcutta. He traveled a thousand miles, by train, only to see her face. He also explains how things were different, and the couples then had a lot more respect for each other. Jai ridicules Veer, who vowed to marry Harleen even before he had gotten to talk to her. But, on Veer's insistence, the young man concedes to pay Meera a surprise visit. Meera is stunned, and the two lie to both Jo and Vikram to have some fun together. They go out as friends, and realize how much they still like each other's company. On the day Jai is to leave, Vikram proposes to Meera. She meets Jai secretly, who tells her she should take a decision after thinking. Angry, Meera tells him to leave her, and also says that they can no longer have any contact or else she will never be able to really move on. Parallel to this, we find that Harleen has told Veer she was engaged without being told, and he must leave her. Jai is surprised on Meera's wedding, and tells her nothing can be done now. He goes back, and gets his dream job in San Francisco the same day Meera realizes her marriage is a mistake. She tells Vikram the truth and calls Jai, but he tells her about the Golden Gate before she can tell him what is on her mind. Realizing he is going to San Francisco, she tells him nothing but returns to Vikram's house, dejected. Parallel to this, Veer Singh declares his intentions of marrying Harleen but is badly beaten by her family. Jai slowly begins to lose interest in his ""dream job"" and is beaten badly by some thugs when, while being mugged, he refuses to give them a picture of Meera. He then realizes he still loves her, and goes back to India. He finds Vikram, who informs him that Meera left him the day that he, Jai, had told her about his job in San Francisco. In the past storyline, Veer Singh travels to Harleen's house on the day of her wedding, and convinces her mother that Harleen can only be happy with him. Harleen's mother lets Veer Singh secretly sneak out with her daughter, and the two marry to have a happily ever after. In the present, Jai goes to Meera's work, at the Old Fort, and they have a heart-touching reunion. In the end, the song Aahun Aahun is played in the theme of Aam Janta  and Pratigya, in which Veer Singh represents Pratigya, while Jai represents Aam Janta. Each shows his different way of love, but both conclude that love has never changed. It shows that, even though, people these days try to make themselves believe that love is just an infatuation that goes away with time and that there is no such thing as ""true love"" or ""soulmate"", in their hearts they still love each other with that passion."

When they go into Stefan's room, Vlad enters a short while after, telling them to keep the noise down. As he leaves, Roxy notices something red on his hand, as though dried blood. At home, she quickly starts to believe that Stefan's family are vampires. She meets Stefan at a small gazebo in the woods with garlic and different holy relics to test whether or not he is a vampire. He passes the test, but it is clear that he has no idea that his uncle is a vampire. Roxy hastily says goodbye and runs off. Finding Seth and his gang, Roxy tells them about this, and they go and investigate. Roxy and Seth find several wooden crates in Vlad's barn. In one of them is a horrifying painting. Vlad hears their screaming, and the club shoots him with garlic and holy water-loaded water guns, they realized that Vlad is not effected and they run off, but Vlad manages to catch Roxy. When he calls Susan over, Roxy blurts out ""He's a vampire!"". Vlad then explains that he is a painter and the ""blood"" on his hands is merely red paint. Roxy apologizes, but still gets grounded. However, she receives a letter from Stefan saying to meet him at the gazebo. Once there, Roxy learns that Stefan's parents are very poor, and his father , an artist, hoped that Vlad, who is really a family friend, could sell his paintings  in America, but it turns out that Vlad has signed his name on the paintings to sell them for his own benefit. Meanwhile, Max meets up with his old friend Jill  to egg the sheriff's house. However, the eggs were actually hard-boiled and break right through the window. While everyone else runs off, Max stays, knowing he deserves to be punished. The sheriff tells him about a high school prank gone wrong, resulting in the entire school burning down. His father tried to send him to a military academy, but he ran away to go on an amateur music tour. When he got back, he wanted to tell his father that he had learned that he was acting in his son's best interest, but his father had died. He ends the story by letting Max off the hook after telling him that, though his parents have let him down, it does not mean that they do not love him. Susan gives Roxy a spark of idea on how to stop Vlad and make him confess: scaring the confession out of him. They set up a haunted house, with various scares along the way, until it ends in Vlad running into the forest. Roxy says that she is a vampire, and that she will turn him into a living dead. Terrified, he confesses to his crimes, and the sheriff, who was spying on Roxy's plan takes him to jail for. At dinner, Jon proposes to Susan. She accepts and they are engaged. Max learns to overcome his depression. Best of all, with the money for the paintings, Stefan's parents are able to come to America."

When Roxy points out that the house is so quiet and dark, Stefan says his uncle Vlad Petrescu  sleeps during the day, and is very sensitive to light. When they go into Stefan's room, Vlad enters a short while after, telling them to keep the noise down. As he leaves, Roxy notices something red on his hand, as though dried blood. At home, she quickly starts to believe that Stefan's family are vampires. She meets Stefan at a small gazebo in the woods with garlic and different holy relics to test whether or not he is a vampire. He passes the test, but it is clear that he has no idea that his uncle is a vampire. Roxy hastily says goodbye and runs off. Finding Seth and his gang, Roxy tells them about this, and they go and investigate. Roxy and Seth find several wooden crates in Vlad's barn. In one of them is a horrifying painting. Vlad hears their screaming, and the club shoots him with garlic and holy water-loaded water guns, they realized that Vlad is not effected and they run off, but Vlad manages to catch Roxy. When he calls Susan over, Roxy blurts out ""He's a vampire!"". Vlad then explains that he is a painter and the ""blood"" on his hands is merely red paint. Roxy apologizes, but still gets grounded. However, she receives a letter from Stefan saying to meet him at the gazebo. Once there, Roxy learns that Stefan's parents are very poor, and his father , an artist, hoped that Vlad, who is really a family friend, could sell his paintings  in America, but it turns out that Vlad has signed his name on the paintings to sell them for his own benefit. Meanwhile, Max meets up with his old friend Jill  to egg the sheriff's house. However, the eggs were actually hard-boiled and break right through the window. While everyone else runs off, Max stays, knowing he deserves to be punished. The sheriff tells him about a high school prank gone wrong, resulting in the entire school burning down. His father tried to send him to a military academy, but he ran away to go on an amateur music tour. When he got back, he wanted to tell his father that he had learned that he was acting in his son's best interest, but his father had died. He ends the story by letting Max off the hook after telling him that, though his parents have let him down, it does not mean that they do not love him. Susan gives Roxy a spark of idea on how to stop Vlad and make him confess: scaring the confession out of him. They set up a haunted house, with various scares along the way, until it ends in Vlad running into the forest. Roxy says that she is a vampire, and that she will turn him into a living dead. Terrified, he confesses to his crimes, and the sheriff, who was spying on Roxy's plan takes him to jail for. At dinner, Jon proposes to Susan. She accepts and they are engaged.

Meanwhile, Susan is slightly shocked to find out that Jon  wants to move in with her. When Roxy goes to visit Stefan at his house, she sees an old woman  stirring something strangely red in a cauldron. When Roxy points out that the house is so quiet and dark, Stefan says his uncle Vlad Petrescu  sleeps during the day, and is very sensitive to light. When they go into Stefan's room, Vlad enters a short while after, telling them to keep the noise down. As he leaves, Roxy notices something red on his hand, as though dried blood. At home, she quickly starts to believe that Stefan's family are vampires. She meets Stefan at a small gazebo in the woods with garlic and different holy relics to test whether or not he is a vampire. He passes the test, but it is clear that he has no idea that his uncle is a vampire. Roxy hastily says goodbye and runs off. Finding Seth and his gang, Roxy tells them about this, and they go and investigate. Roxy and Seth find several wooden crates in Vlad's barn. In one of them is a horrifying painting.

An older couple dressed in black is closest to the casket, suggesting that they are the deceased's parents. The grief-stricken father weeps openly as he is comforted by his wife. The story then cuts from the cemetery and to a car swerving erratically on a street, focusing on a young man, 17-year-old Richie Werner , who is doing drugs in the car with his three friends. The driver, Brick, is then pulled over for his erratic driving. The police officer tells Brick he is willing to let him off the hook as a favor...and that he expects favors in return for those he does favors for. Brick agrees. This is the beginning of a series of episodes that bring Richie into conflict with his father, George , a stern man who loves his son, but has trouble expressing his feelings. Eileen Brennan plays Richie's loving but weak mother Carol, and Lance Kerwin plays his younger brother Russell, whom Richie, despite his demons, is very protective of. Both men make genuine attempts to meet each other halfway, yielding some success, with Richie getting a job  and George helping his son get closer to Shiela , a girl from school that Richie likes. However, the relationship between George and Richie worsens as social pressures and personal failings drive Richie deeper into his drug addiction. The interaction between father and son continues to deteriorate, largely due to Richie's escalating drug abuse and his father's unwillingness to enter family counseling. The movie's climax comes when George intervenes by informing the police of his son's activities, in a desperate attempt to save his life at all costs. Richie confronts his father in a drug-induced rage , threatening him with an awl. George retreats to the basement in the family's home, where Richie follows him. George retrieves a revolver from his toolbox and aims it at Richie, but does not fire it, cocking the hammer back in an attempt to convince his son that he is not bluffing. Richie screams repeatedly for his father to shoot him. George manages to overpower Richie by knocking the awl from his hand, but Richie retreats upstairs and returns to the basement with a pair of scissors and taunts his father over and over again, daring him to shoot him, approaching him closer, thinking that George doesn't have the nerve to do it. With a steady hand, George pulls the trigger. A blinding flash from the gun's barrel then morphs into a bouquet of flowers on a mahogany casket in the same cemetery, surrounded by the same mourners in black. Following Psalm 23, a brief eulogy is read by Shiela: {{cquote}} The movie ends with a brief written epilogue over a still shot of George placing a rose on Richie's casket, stating that a grand jury voted unanimously not to indict George Werner for the shooting death of his son, and that he lives as a free man.

Lord Krishna consoles Kunti and promises to ever protect the Pandavas and guide them through troubles and problems that may occur in life.  The sons of Pandu and Dhritarashtra progeny break into an argument. When Duryodhana insults the Pandavas as ""dependents"", Bheema counters by saying that, the Kauravas are the progeny of a widow. Duryodhana asks Veda Vyasa for an explanation. He is then told that, since his mother, Gandhari had an astrological defect, she is first married of to a goat and then married to his father. Duryodhana gains animosity towards the kingdom of Gandhara where the king, the father of his mother Gandhari, rules. He attacks Gandhara and lays waste of the whole kingdom. He them imprisons the royal family in his prison. He gives them only one rice grain per prisoner. The king of Gandhara then stops everyone from grabbing the little food that is provided. He says that instead of everyone dying, they could keep at least one of their princes alive. He chooses Sakuni to be alive. Sakuni takes an oath that he will do everything he can to destroy the entire Kaurava clan. He makes magic dice from his father's spinal cord. The magic dice show exactly the number that he would want. Duryodhana takes pity on the lone prisoner, Sakuni after the rest of the Gandhara royal family dies in prison out of starvation. Sakuni joins the evil of coterie of Duryodhana, Karna and Dushyasana.  Sakuni schemes an evil plan to kill the Pandavas through trickery. He constructs a house made of wax in Varanasi. Pandavas are ordered to go on pilgrimage to Varanasi until the troubled affairs of the state are resolved. Krishna sees through the plan of the evil Sakuni. He warns Bheema to keep an eye on miscreants trying to burn the house. He later orders Bheema to dig an underground tunnel from the wax house into a forest nearby, which Bheema does. On a midnight, as Krishna predicted, the house is burned by fire on the orders of Duryodhana.  Bheema however carries his four brothers and mother on his back and races through the tunnel and takes them to the hiding spot. There a certain cannibal rakshasa named Hidimbasura lives with his sister Hidimbi. He smells the scent of human beings and orders his sister to bring them. Hidimbi however fall in love at first sight with Bheema. Unable to wait any longer, Hidimbasura comes to kill the humans himself. Bheema however kills him very easily. Hidimbi is married to Bheema. She would later give birth to Ghatotkacha from this union.  Here the movie, takes focus of Pandavas and instead focusses on Lord Krishna as the primary character for some duration.  Sisupala, the king of Chedi and Rukmi are the kings under emperor Jarasandha. All three have deep hatred towards Krishna. Jarasandha proposes that Rukmi should marry his sister, Rukmini, to Sisupala. Little do they know that she is in love with Krishna himself. Narada acts as the mediator between the love couple. After a brief courtship, Rukmini elopes with Krishna. Rukmi tries to stop Krishna and challenges him to a fight. Krishna easily defeats him, and grants his wife - Rukmini's wish by keeping him alive. He however shaves half of his hair to add insult to the injury.  The movie returns to its primary focus on the Pandavas with Duryodhana taking a major share of the screen space towards the end.  Bakasura, Bheema, Keechaka, Jarasandha and Duryodhana are all born with their fate mingled with each other. As a result of that, the first amongst the five to kill the another... will eventually kill the other three. This secret is known to Krishna alone. The Pandavas live under the guise of sadhus in a remote town. Bakasura is a very powerful monster who plagues the town. He blackmails them to send two oxen, a cartload of food and a human being everyday to quench his hunger. It so happens that, the house owners of the Pandavas get their turn to send the human being on that day. However, Kunti says that she would rather sacrifice her own son instead of their only one, since she has five children. Bheema sets of to the monster's place, but on the way he eats all the food. After a very ferocious fight with the monster, he does kill it in the end. Bheema emerges as the victor.  The king of Panchala, Drupada announces an archery contest to win the hand of his daughter in marriage. Krishna tricks Karna into losing the contest. Arjuna however shows up as a Brahmin youth and wins the contest. Thus he wins Draupadi as a price. He goes home and tells his mother that he has won a price. Unknowingly, his mother asks him to share his price amongst all the five brothers. Thus all five brother, marry Draupadi.  As the Pandavas have emerged out of their disguise, they get a share of the Kaurava kingdom and develop the city of Indraprastha.  Jarasandha is the arch-nemesis of Krishna. No one other than Bheema or the other three mentioned earlier, can defeat him and he chases Krishna until Dwaraka. Bheema and Krishna go as Brahmins into the fortress of Jarasandha. There they ask for a fight. Jarasandha chooses Bheema as his sparring partner. During the fight, Krishna signals Bheema to tear him apart and as a result, he will be killed. However the body parts of Jarasandha rejoin as a part of a boon and he lives yet again. After some time, Krishna signals Bheema to throw Jarasandha's body parts in opposite directions. This time however Jarasandha dies.  Yudhisthira performs the Rajasuya yaga, to be crowned as the emperor. The Kauravas, arrive at Indraprastha as guests. Duryodhana visits the mayasabha, where he is overawed with the beauty of sculpture and architecture. However, when he is returning, he trips and falls into a pool. He hears some people laughing and sees Draupadi is among the crowd. He then concludes that she is behind all this and vows to avenge the insult in the presence of his brothers, Karna and Sakuni.  Sisupala is a relative of Sri Krishna and he is born with a lot of abnormal features. When Krishna touches him during his childhood, the child becomes normal. However a result of the broken curse, Krishna is destined to kill Sisupala. Krishna however promises Sisupala's mother that he would give his son a hundred chances before killing him. When Yudhistra elects Krishna as the chief guest at the Rajasuya yaga, Sisupala becomes enraged and foulmouths Krishna. Krishna counts hundred absurdities hurled at him by Sisupala. Then after his hundredth mistake Krishna hurls his discus Sudharshana chakra towards him. Sisupala's head is severed. When Duryodhana calls for Krishna to be arrested, Krishna unveils his Vishwa-avatar"

Xiao Wei is a fox spirit who feasts on human hearts in order to maintain her lovely, youthful appearance. When General Wang Sheng rescues her from a band of Xiongnu and brings her home, trouble brews as the demon falls in love with the general, who is married to Peirong. Another older love triangle is present, between Pang Yong, Wang Sheng and Peirong. Pang Yong is a former general who was in love with Peirong, but eventually lost her to Wang Sheng. Peirong asks Pang Yong for help as she suspects Xiao Wei for what she really is. Pang is aided by an inexperienced ""demon hunter"", a young female fighter called Xia Bing. Hints of a developing relationship between Xia and Pang are there, although this is never fully explored. Another subplot revolves around Xiao Wei's demon ally, who is actually morphed from a chameleon, and who also has unreciprocated feelings for Xiao Wei and helps her obtain all the human hearts she needs to maintain her human ""skin"", whom many a times almost got caught by Wang's soldiers, thus enraging Xiao Wei into chasing him off despite his pleas and advise that a love between demon and human is impossible and to let him stay by her side. One night, Peirong found out about Xiao Wei's true form when she undresses and peeled off her human skin right in front of her very eyes. Horrified at her findings, she tried again and again to tell Wang of Xiao Wei's true nature, but he brushes them off as her being tired and fatigue and told her to rest more. Peirong went back to Xiao Wei's residence and confronted her. Xiao Wei told Peirong that she wanted to be Madam Wang, and told her to back down. Peirong made Xiao Wei swear that she won't feast on another human's heart in order to be youthful and love Wang Sheng faithfully until they're aged. Xiao Wei agreed and forced Peirong to drink a potion which would make her the 'demon' while she becomes Madam Wang. After drinking the potion, Peirong's hair and skin turned white like Xiao Wei's true form and in order to keep her promise, she ran away from Wang residence while everyone framed her for being the demon. Pang Yong came and rescued Peiong just as she is about to die and together with Xia Bing, they ran off to a nearby mountain's cave and hide there. Xia Bing recounted her grandfather's experience that the color white is the most poisonous form of demon's poison, and the whiter Peirong is, the closer she is to death. Wang Sheng arrived with his soldiers and Xiao Wei with her maidservants, whom all wanted to kill Peirong. Wang Sheng shouted to his soldiers that he will kill her himself if she really is the demon. Tearfully, Wang Sheng asked Peirong if she really killed humans and if she really is the demon, all of which she answered yes tearfully. Wang Sheng announces that even if she is a demon, she is his Peirong, and she is still his wife. Smiling, Peirong impaled herself with a dagger Wang Sheng is holding and died in his embrace. Xiao Wei tried to gain Wang Sheng's affection by getting closer to him, but he only cried sadly while holding on to Peirong's body. At that moment, Xiao Wei realized that no matter what she did, Wang Sheng will never love her. Heartbroken, Pang Yong shouted to the entire soldiers troupe that Xiao Wei is the real demon, not Peirong, and he proved it by trying to slash Xiao Wei but couldn't since Xiao Wei's body is as hard as steel. Pang Yong almost got defeated when Wang Sheng came towards Xiao Wei. He knelt down in front of her and tearfully begged her to bring Peirong back to life. Xiao Wei, heartbroken, asked Wang Sheng what would she get if she bring her back to life, and Wang Sheng told her that he loves Xiao Wei, but he already have Peirong, and killed himself. Xiao Wei screamed her heart out and her skin whitened to her demon form but her hair still remained black. Xiao Wei willingly gave Wang Sheng her life power in the form of a small sphere, but before she could bring Wang Sheng back to life, her demon ally, the chameleon came and snatched it from her, reprimanding her for her willingness to sacrifice her power which she had cultivated from thousand of years. He swallowed it and told her that he is going to take her back home. Pang Yong and Xia Bing fought the chameleon, and at last, Xia Bing drew out a demon slaying sword and killed the chameleon, but not before the chameleon killed Pang Yong. Xiao Wei tearfully gathered two of the glowing life spheres, one of hers while the other of the chameleon's. She crushed it and dies as Peirong and Wang Sheng came back to life. Everyone in the cave who had died were brought back to life as well, including Pang Yong. In the ending credit, Xiao Wei is reincarnated in her white desert fox form while beside her is the chameleon."

He swallowed it and told her that he is going to take her back home. Pang Yong and Xia Bing fought the chameleon, and at last, Xia Bing drew out a demon slaying sword and killed the chameleon, but not before the chameleon killed Pang Yong. Xiao Wei tearfully gathered two of the glowing life spheres, one of hers while the other of the chameleon's. She crushed it and dies as Peirong and Wang Sheng came back to life.

Xiao Wei is a fox spirit who feasts on human hearts in order to maintain her lovely, youthful appearance. When General Wang Sheng rescues her from a band of Xiongnu and brings her home, trouble brews as the demon falls in love with the general, who is married to Peirong. Another older love triangle is present, between Pang Yong, Wang Sheng and Peirong. Pang Yong is a former general who was in love with Peirong, but eventually lost her to Wang Sheng. Peirong asks Pang Yong for help as she suspects Xiao Wei for what she really is. Pang is aided by an inexperienced ""demon hunter"", a young female fighter called Xia Bing. Hints of a developing relationship between Xia and Pang are there, although this is never fully explored. Another subplot revolves around Xiao Wei's demon ally, who is actually morphed from a chameleon, and who also has unreciprocated feelings for Xiao Wei and helps her obtain all the human hearts she needs to maintain her human ""skin"", whom many a times almost got caught by Wang's soldiers, thus enraging Xiao Wei into chasing him off despite his pleas and advise that a love between demon and human is impossible and to let him stay by her side. One night, Peirong found out about Xiao Wei's true form when she undresses and peeled off her human skin right in front of her very eyes. Horrified at her findings, she tried again and again to tell Wang of Xiao Wei's true nature, but he brushes them off as her being tired and fatigue and told her to rest more. Peirong went back to Xiao Wei's residence and confronted her. Xiao Wei told Peirong that she wanted to be Madam Wang, and told her to back down. Peirong made Xiao Wei swear that she won't feast on another human's heart in order to be youthful and love Wang Sheng faithfully until they're aged. Xiao Wei agreed and forced Peirong to drink a potion which would make her the 'demon' while she becomes Madam Wang. After drinking the potion, Peirong's hair and skin turned white like Xiao Wei's true form and in order to keep her promise, she ran away from Wang residence while everyone framed her for being the demon. Pang Yong came and rescued Peiong just as she is about to die and together with Xia Bing, they ran off to a nearby mountain's cave and hide there. Xia Bing recounted her grandfather's experience that the color white is the most poisonous form of demon's poison, and the whiter Peirong is, the closer she is to death. Wang Sheng arrived with his soldiers and Xiao Wei with her maidservants, whom all wanted to kill Peirong. Wang Sheng shouted to his soldiers that he will kill her himself if she really is the demon. Tearfully, Wang Sheng asked Peirong if she really killed humans and if she really is the demon, all of which she answered yes tearfully. Wang Sheng announces that even if she is a demon, she is his Peirong, and she is still his wife. Smiling, Peirong impaled herself with a dagger Wang Sheng is holding and died in his embrace. Xiao Wei tried to gain Wang Sheng's affection by getting closer to him, but he only cried sadly while holding on to Peirong's body. At that moment, Xiao Wei realized that no matter what she did, Wang Sheng will never love her. Heartbroken, Pang Yong shouted to the entire soldiers troupe that Xiao Wei is the real demon, not Peirong, and he proved it by trying to slash Xiao Wei but couldn't since Xiao Wei's body is as hard as steel. Pang Yong almost got defeated when Wang Sheng came towards Xiao Wei. He knelt down in front of her and tearfully begged her to bring Peirong back to life. Xiao Wei, heartbroken, asked Wang Sheng what would she get if she bring her back to life, and Wang Sheng told her that he loves Xiao Wei, but he already have Peirong, and killed himself.

Mrs. Chan  is a housewife with a grown-up daughter who tends to be domineering of her husband. Mrs. Lee , on the other hand, is meek, with a chauvinistic husband  and a young son who is troubling her with his poor grades. Mrs. Wong  is a garbage lady who has to support a family of four daughters. Her doting tailor husband  is out of a job, and the family has to make ends meet nonetheless. Her life is thrown out of order when she is laid off her job. Mrs Chan and Mrs Lee originally join the belly dancing classes held by foreign teacher Pasha  out of curiosity. Pasha replaces their traditional dance teacher and many in the neighborhood are unwilling to learn the dance as they think it indecent. Before long, Mrs Wong and a younger woman, single mother Cherry , join them. Cherry is a twenty-something gold digger who nonetheless wants to find a father for her baby boy. The belly dancing classes become the highlight of the lives of these women, as they try to cope with upheavals and stresses in their private lives. Mrs Chan's husband has an affair with a younger girl and she is thinking of divorce, yet unable to take the definitive step to break with her husband. Mrs Lee's husband objects to her classes and bar her from attending them, especially after her understanding mother-in-law faints after dancing too vigorously during a belly dance gathering. Mrs Wong has to deal with the stress of having no income, even though her husband voices his support for her belly dancing. Cherry intends to end her gold digging ways and settle down with someone who can accept her baby son. The film ends with each finding solution to her problem: Mrs Chan accepts divorce after support from her grown-up daughter; Mrs Lee reunites with her husband after moving out briefly; Mrs Wong finds a new job, and even Cherry discovers someone who cares enough for her and her baby son."

Mostyn mistakenly believes Oakes was lethal on purpose. Twenty years later, Mostyn  and his boss  are in trouble due to a series of embarrassing security disasters. To save his job, the chief orders Mostyn to hire an assassin to illegally eliminate security leaks without official authorization. Mostyn recruits Boysie into the Secret Service without first telling him what his employment will entail, luring him in with a lavish apartment and a fancy car. After Boysie passes a training course, Mostyn informs him that his code name is ""L"", and that it stands for liquidator. Unable to resign and not a killer himself, Boysie secretly hires a freelance professional assassin  to do the dirty work. Things go well until Oakes persuades Mostyn's secretary Iris  to spend the weekend with him on the Côte d'Azur, even though Mostyn has warned him that any contact between spies and civilian employees is a serious criminal offence. Boysie is captured by enemy agents led by Sheriek , who firmly believes he is on assignment and wants to know who the target is. However, Sheriek's superior, Chekhov , is coldly furious that he has gone beyond his orders to merely watch Boysie, thus endangering a much more important operation. He has Sheriek arrange for Boysie to escape. Then Quadrant  arrives with a new mission for Boysie. He is to stage a fake assassination attempt on the Duke of Edinburgh when he visits a Royal Air Force base in order to test the security. Boysie has been duped: Quadrant is actually an enemy agent, and the bullets in his sniper rifle are real. Mostyn shows up in the duke's place and is able to locate Boysie, but while they are distracted, Quadrant and a pilot steal the real target: the Vulture, an advanced new stealth aircraft which the duke was to inspect.

Six of his friends—Neil , Mikey , Graham , Matt , Patrick  and Banksy , all of whom have their own women problems—decide to take him on a ""boy's weekend"". They hire a minibus driven by Candy  to Moodley, a village where the women allegedly outnumber the men 4 to 1. Banksy misses the bus and travels to the town on his own. Arriving at the town, the boys find it quiet and surprisingly devoid of women. On the way back to the minibus, the men notice a hooded teenage girl Alison Carroll being attacked by a man in military uniform. They rush to her aid and in the confusion of the moment, the hooded teen takes the soldier's knife and stabs Neil. They run for the bus dragging the unconscious soldier with them but discover that Candy, their once-hot bus driver has already become infected. More infected women appear and begin to attack them as they retreat to a house owned by Mikey's grandmother. The soldier  admits that the town has been infected by a biological agent that turns women into man-hating cannibals. The men make another attempt to get on the bus, using the wounded Neil to lure Candy away. However two other infected women had joined her and chase the men back into the streets. They scatter about the village, hiding in a toy store, a clothes shop, and the butcher shop. Patrick gets trapped on a billboard. Neil runs into a house but is taken prisoner by a morbidly obese woman who cuts off his little finger and eats it. Neil eventually escapes and is joined by the others, after their own misadventures, in the local church. There they discover a military command center. Matt powers up the computers and they talk briefly to a local politician, Meg Nut . She had been involved in the distribution of the toxin disguised as biological washing powder. The soldier finds a control box and explains it is a sonar device designed to emit a high pitched sound that will stun the zombified women once they have evolved further into ""Phase 2"" monsters that are faster, more intelligent and weirder. The women so change but when the soldier uses the sonar device it is revealed to have stopped working. He is then killed by Mikey's grandmother, before Matt bludgeons the monster-nan to death with a golf club. Traumatized by what he has done, Matt walks off to 'cool it off' and is killed by a ""Phase 2"" monster which had appeared from the basement of the Church. After finding a nest with woman feasting on the bodies of men in the basement, the men barricade themselves on the roof of the church as more zombies break in. Banksy eventually arrives at Moodley. Although at first he believes his friends to be high on drugs, he soon recognizes the seriousness of the situation and fetches a ladder to get them off the roof. Graham is then attacked by the morbidly obese woman. Banksy leads the surviving group to his vehicle—a small Smart car, definitely not big enough for all of them. As they all argue Patrick is attacked and dies a bloody death. Everyone else heads to the minibus, where Banksy is killed as Vince fights off Candy. Vince berates Neil and Mikey, who treat their women poorly but get away with it, while men like him and their dead friends treat women with respect, only to be discarded or killed. He resolves to be more like them. Before they can drive away, the voice of the still-alive Graham crackles over the walkie-talkie. As he makes his way out from the church Graham powers up the stun-device using a high-voltage power supply. With it now working, the men are able to stop the women in their tracks, however Vince inadvertently drops and breaks it. The infected are once again unleashed and, with the injured Graham in a shopping trolley, the four make a run for it, laughing."

Emma, one of the children, finds a small tree and decides to plant it, but her friends laugh at her because of it, making her sad. However, Barbie cheers her up by telling her that a small tree can grow into a very big tree. Then Barbie tells the children about Thumbelina. Thumbelina is one of the Twillerbees. Twillerbees have the ability to make plants grow faster . Thumbelina is excited when there will be Twillerbabies. She creates fake wings for herself and for her two friends, Janessa and Chrysella. They will use the wings to see the Twillerbuds bloom to be Twillerbabies. When they try the wings, suddenly many tractors come to their field. Hiding in the flowers, the trio are trapped. They are brought into an apartment they never knew before. The apartment belongs to the parents of a spoiled, wealthy girl, named Makena. The flower bed is placed in Makena's bedroom. As Thumbelina, Chrysella, and Janessa search for a way to go back to their field, Makena's dog Poofles run after them. Makena comes into the bedroom while the trio hides. Makena talks to her friend Violet from a cellular phone about her parents who will build a factory on the Twillerbees field. An upset Thumbelina scolds Makena, who is surprised, yet happy to find an interesting thing to be demonstrated to Violet. She always competes against Violet. The three Twillerbees try to escape from Makena and Poofles. Finally, Thumbelina sends Chrysella and Janessa home. They will disturb the work in the field while Thumbelina will talk to Makena. Thumbelina makes Makena promise not to tell anyone about her and Makena must persuade her parents to stop building the factory. Thumbelina will make special things for Makena in return. At first, Makena does not talk seriously to her parents about it. She even wants to break her promise to Thumbelina when she invites Violet and Ashlynn. She wants them to see the thing everyone in the universe cannot have which is Thumbelina. Thumbelina becomes angry at Makena and leaves the apartment, just before Makena realizes that Violet and Ashlyn are not her true friends, Thumbelina is her true friend. Makena goes to the field and asks for Thumbelina's forgiveness. She also wants to save the field desperately and earnestly. Thumbelina, forgiving her, shows Makena the other Twillerbees and the Twillerbuds. That night, Makena, Thumbelina, Janessa, Chrysella, Poofles, and Lola the bird works hard in the green house to grow the plants. The next day, Makena asks her parents to stop the building, and Thumbelina shows herself. Thumbelina explains to them about the Twillerbuds that will bloom soon. Evan and Vanessa, Makena's parents, are convinced and try to stop Myron, the contractor, from destroying the field. With the help of birds and other Twillerbees, Myron's workers run away, thinking that the field is haunted, But Myron is angry and determined to finish his work as he hates flowers. Ultimately, Makena and Thumbelina arrive and they stop Myron. Immediately, Evan and Vanessa arrive at the field to have the factory project shut down. A team of birds chase Myron away, and Makena and her family see the Twillerbuds bloom. To prevent others from building factories in the field, they turn the field into a Reserved Park. In the end of the story, it shows that Barbie and the children are in Makena's Reserved Park. Barbie says that even the smallest person can make a big difference. Makena is small, compared to the adults. And so are the children. The strange thing in the story is that Thumbelina, Janessa, and Chrysella who are in the story, suddenly appear, sitting in the tree. Barbie waves her hand at them. The trio then use their Twillerbee magic to make Emma's tree grow, meaning the story was true after all.

This is followed by a flashback to when David, his assistant Jane and two other researchers tranquilize a polar bear, then discover the frozen remains of a wooly mammoth. They transport the polar bear to their research station. David calls his daughter Evelyn and pleads with her to visit the research station. Their relationship has been strained since the recent death of her mother. Evelyn tentatively agrees to come. After David hangs up, David and Jane learn that the tranquilized bear has died. Meanwhile, a group of students, Ling, Freddie and Adam, are selected to join David's research team. Days later, the research team begins feeling the effects of a strange illness, and David tells helicopter pilot Bart not to bring his daughter Evelyn to the station. However Evelyn insists, Bart ignores David's orders, and brings her to the station along with the students. When they arrive, Jane shoots and apparently kills David and another researcher. Meanwhile the students discover the body of the polar bear, and Bart is bitten by a bug after touching it. Evelyn is awakened in the middle of the night by an ATV approaching the station. When she goes to investigate, she discovers Jane sitting in the helicopter. Jane has destroyed the helicopter's control panel, eliminating any immediate chance of getting out quickly. Ling wakes up with many bug bites on her face and torso, and Jane dies in Evelyn's arms. Realizing Ling is sick, Freddie calls in a helicopter to rescue Ling. Taking the ATV and backtracking, Evelyn and Adam discover bug eggs in the brain of the mammoth. Assuming her father has been infected, Evelyn and Adam deduce that something has made the group sick. Evelyn decides to cancel the rescue helicopter and quarantine the group until a better-prepared team can rescue them. Freddie, discovering he too is infected, goes berserk and destroys the radio. The bite on Bart's arm has started to display signs of the infection. Adam and Evelyn amputate Bart's arm at the elbow. They decide to destroy the facility and wait things out in the helicopter. Ling is attacked by bugs who have made their way in through the ventilation system. Bart discovers that the amputation was useless as his upper arm is now showing signs of infection. He opts to stay behind with Ling. They deliberately overdose on morphine and fall asleep as the bugs swarm over them. Freddie comes running out, refusing to be checked for infection, then turns on Evelyn and David. As he is about to shoot Evelyn, he is shot from behind by David. David insists they destroy the research station. Evelyn finds a video David recorded and discovers that David has intentionally infected himself, preparing to set the bugs loose to teach humanity a lesson about global warming's effects. As a rescue helicopter comes to pick up David, Evelyn and Adam are locked up by David, but they escape. Adam tries to hang on to a helicopter skid but falls to the ground. As the helicopter starts flying away, Evelyn shoots at it, causing it to crash into a building previously doused in gasoline. David and the helicopter crew die in the resulting fire. Evelyn finds Adam, who dies in her arms. The following day another rescue team arrives, finding the destruction and Evelyn, the sole survivor. Later, as a radio station airs information based on Evelyn's reports, a hunter calls his dog away from a dead bird the dog has been eating. Bugs emerge from the bird's body. The closing scene shows the hunter's truck heading towards a large city.

Eight years later, he is dating Meg Brickman , a high school senior who is bitter about being in the chorus and not having a principal role in Gribble's latest production of The Wiz. Marc is keen for Gribble to produce the demo tape for his a cappella singing group Meridian 8 . Gribble, however, tries to avoid Marc, frustrated that Marc refuses to leave him alone because of the friendly advice he gave Marc eight years ago. While tidying Meg's bedroom, Marc finds a tape labelled ""Meg singing"", but discovers after he listens to it that she is singing with Gribble, and at the end of the song, their noises suggest that they are having sex. Meg, meanwhile, begins to doubt Gribble's sincerity when he tells her what a terrific singer she is when she realizes that she is always in the chorus. Questioning whether she even enjoys singing, she decides to quit. Marc drives to a performance with Meridian 8, where the only way he can keep the group from splitting up is to lie that Gribble has given them the chance to record in a studio. After insisting that he should sing his Tin Man's song, he starts crying on stage, and is later forced to admit that Gribble has not yet responded to his request to produce the demo. That night, the opening night of The Wiz, Marc is working as a chauffeur for a high school prom couple. After dropping them off and cutting off his frequently ridiculed ponytail, he arrives at the show in the interval. He unsuccessfully tries to discuss Meridian 8's demo with Gribble, who brushes him off, then learns from another bandmate that they are losing another member. After hearing the Tin Man's song from outside the auditorium, Marc goes inside and drags Gribble out into an empty classroom. Marc confronts him about his empty promises for Meridian 8 to record in a studio. Gribble tells Marc that he is still living as if he were in high school, and an angered Marc threatens to play Meg's tape to the school principal and expose Gribble's affair with a student. As they fight, Marc accuses Gribble of denying Meg a main role as a means of revenge on him, and destroys the tape for Meg's sake. He then goes backstage and breaks up with Meg because she is too young for him. Seeing that the actor of the Wiz has injured himself, Marc takes his cape, runs onto the stage and sings the Wiz's song. Meg runs away but decides that she loves singing and returns to the stage. Marc's performance is met with cheers from the audience, and he is overjoyed. One year later, having left exorcised his Wizard of Oz demons, Marc is working as a professional singer under the title ""The Marc Pease Experience""."

The Hardys, Ma and Pop, daughter Jane and son Jeff, hire the men to play for the dudes. Sam Thorne, Jane's self-appointed boyfriend, ranch cowhand and amateur crooner, is jealous of Jane's interest in Elly. Elly is so successful as a cowboy singer, that when theatrical agent Ray Chadwick arrives at the ranch on a vacation and hears him, he signs Elly immediately. Chadwick thinks that Elly is a real cowboy and Jane coaches him to talk like one. In spite of his fear of animals, he gets away with the deception. He makes a successful screen test as a cowboy, using the name Wyoming Steve Gibson, but he and Chadwick, who now knows the truth, fear that the deception will be revealed when the movie people arrive in New York from Hollywood with Elly's contract.  Meanwhile, Jane and some of the ranch people are traveling East as well so Sam can sing on Captain Rose's Amateur Hour in New York. Jane tells Sam that she is in love with Elly and Sam is so angry that when he isn't a big success on the show, he blurts out the truth about Elly's background. To prove that Elly is on the level, Chadwick and his assistant Pat Dunn suggest that he compete in a rodeo. They take Elly to Professor Landis, who hypnotizes him. Under hypnosis, Elly leaps on a horse, rides to Madison Square Garden, enters the bulldogging contest and sets a new record. He sneezes and wakes from the hypnosis, but the movie people are convinced that he is a real cowboy. He signs the contract and kisses Jane to seal the deal.

The overarching plot involves the beginnings of independence displayed by the androids, what they do with that independence within the bounds of the three laws, and what motivates them. Secondary plots involve the individual stories of each android the protagonists encounter in the cafe, and how they come to discover which patrons are androids and which are not."

These include farting mud-men, small reptilian demons, giant spiders, an arachnid woman, an octopus-like creature with electric tentacles, a skeletal witch, a Grim Reaper statue, a vampiric boy in a monk's habit, and a large group of zombies. Eventually, the entire group is killed by the monsters and Kreon hopes to preserve his bride for longer, but she escapes by killing him and trying to outrun the zombie horde around the mansion. The bride eventually is saved by a man who drives her away in his car. Kreon regenerates out of a coffin as it is revealed the man in the car is actually the cat-like creature with the hook hand. The camera pans on Kreon's laughing face and the credits roll.

The news spreads like wildfire in the city and also reaches Beethoven, who, together with his friends, is sitting in the tavern. Beethoven is very enthusiastic about the ideals embodied by Napoleon after the French Revolution. He hurries home to write a powerful and glorious symphony - which later becomes famous as Beethoven's ""Eroica"" - for Napoleon. After the symphony is successful, two messengers from Napoleon come to see Beethoven. They request Beethoven to participate in a reception given by the French emperor. Favouring the glamour, Napoleon has elaborated detailed clothing instructions for Beethoven. Beethoven is disappointed by his idol's superficiality and deletes the dedication to Napoleon from the title page of the symphony. For his safety, Beethoven travels to Hungary and finds quarters at the aristocratic home of his pupil Therese van Brunswik and her cousin Giulietta Guicciardi. Beethoven falls in love with Giulietta, who is even willing to leave her fiancé for Beethoven. This interpretation of Beethoven's life is distorted, however, as it was in 1800, four years earlier, that Beethoven actually met Giulietta. In the film story, Therese thinks that, due to his talent, it is not Beethoven's destiny to lead a fulfilling relationship with a woman. Beethoven not only worries about his nephew Karl whom he thinks is leading a dissolute life and is under his mother's harmful influence but also becomes aware of a worsening of his hearing abilities. As Beethoven despairs of a reason why God would want to deprive him off his hearing, Beethoven's friend Amenda replies that Beethoven's destiny is to compose a type of music never heard before. It is saddening for Beethoven to learn during rehearsals for his opera ""Fidelio"" that the musicians cannot follow his ""conducting"", and in fact are actually following their music director instead. In a depressed mood, Beethoven goes home and once more speaks with God, as Amenda's words come to his mind. When Therese comes to look after him, he comes to terms with his destiny and begins to compose again."

As an ex-officer, Drummond knows how the suspected military mastermind would think. He agrees, though he very reluctantly accepts Sergeant Helen Smith of Special Branch as his partner, believing that women are not cut out for that sort of undercover work. Drummond arranges to get caught cheating at poker at his London club so he can drop out of sight. Smith causes a minor car accident involving Arthur Gunns, suspected of being in the gang. Gunns' attraction to Smith and carefully planted evidence showing ""Joe Crandall"" and ""Lily Ross"" to be criminals themselves enables the pair to infiltrate the gang. However, Drummond's friend Algernon Longworth, who has been kept in the dark about the whole matter, becomes convinced that all is not what it seems. He telephones Colonel Webson, a member of Drummond's club, to get him to postpone Drummond's disciplinary meeting. Unfortunately, he inadvertently tips off the secret leader of the gang. Drummond and Smith are taken prisoner. Gunns's girlfriend Molly convinces him to go ahead with the latest planned robbery, enough to set them up for life, despite the police having been put on alert by Drummond. She masquerades as Smith to give phony information to Longworth to pass along to the police regarding the target of the theft. Afterward, Longworth is tied up as well.

Radha Kishen  garlands her husband Avtaar Kishen's  bust. The story starts from a flashback. Radha is the only daughter of Seth Jugal Kishore . Radha is in love with Avtaar, a poor boy. Jugal Kishore resents Radha's love. Hence, the duo elope and get married. Avtaar and Radha face various hardships in life, but ultimately succeed. After 3&nbsp;decades, Avtaar is owner of a small garage and a small fortune. He has two sons, Chander  and Ramesh . Chander is married to Renu , while Ramesh is married to Shobha . Avtaar also has a servant named Sewak . Like Avtaar, his sons have also married rich girls, daughters of Seth Laxmi Narayan . But, they are totally henpecked. When Avtaar discovers this, he leaves his home. Radha and Sewak also follow him. With help of a moneylender Bawaji , Avtaar starts his own garage. Avtaar faces an uphill task, since he has no money to buy equipments, is aged and his right hand is paralysed in a freak accident. Sewak helps his master by illegally donating blood to arrange for money, but when Avtaar thinks that Sewak resorted to robbery, Bawaji tells the truth. Moved, Radha and Avtaar regard him as their own son. Meanwhile, both Ramesh and Chander are enjoying their own life. Avtaar's luck changes again when the engine he is working on gives a successful result. Soon, Avtaar starts manufacturing the engine parts. This gives way to an industrial empire headed by Avtaar, Radha and Sewak. To help other old people like him who were spurned by their own families, Avtaar starts some social institutions. Avtaar's success takes a toll on Laxmi Narayan's business and he holds Chander responsible. Meanwhile Ramesh commits fraud with the bank and is arrested. Shobha come to Avtaar for help, but he rebukes her and sends her away. Radha gets angry over this, but keeps silent. Avtaar secretly gives Bawaji the bail money on the condition that he tells no one the truth. Bawaji bails both Ramesh. Meanwhile holding Chandar responsible for the loss in business, Laxmi Narayan throws him out of the house. Ramesh, Chandar and Shobha go to Radha for help. Although Avataar is not willing to help them. Next day, Avtaar goes to office and does not return. Radha calls him many times and finally reaches office late night. She tries to convince him that she is a mother too. But he doesn't listen to all that. Deep in emotions, Radha accuses him of having turned heartless. Same day, Bawaji meets Radha, whereupon Radha tells him the whole story. Bawaji has to tell the truth to her as he cannot bear Avtaar being insulted despite his big heart. On learning the truth, Radha realizes her mistake and tries to call Avtaar. Sewak informs her that Avataar had a heart attack. Everybody goes to Hospital, where Avataar had already written his will and hands it to Radha and dies. The story comes to the present, where Radha garlands Avtaar's bust and the film ends.

Ray Blent is an honor student and college basketball star. June Ryder has come to the university to study home economics and to find a husband. The students and faculty are scandalized by her unashamed pursuit of Blent. She joins the cheerleader troupe and attends all the classes taken by Blent to ensure she has maximum contact with him. Everyone is aware of her designs on the sexually naive Blent except for him. She succeeds in convincing him that she has an intelligent, inquiring mind that he admires, although this is all done through deception. Blent is secretly propositioned, via a radio message, by a gambling syndicate to lose a key game with a visiting Russian team. He refuses to do this but is unable to return the money as he does not know who is behind the bribe. Rather than deliberately throw a game, he decides to deliberately fail an ethics exam, which automatically disqualifies him from playing. He is the best student in class and the only way he can fail is by copying Ryder's paper. Too late he realizes that his not playing is tantamount to ensuring his team will lose and he has given the gamblers exactly what they want. The film climaxes with the professor giving Blent an oral retest while the game is in progress. Blent passes and plays for the last few minutes, achieving a one-point victory for his school. The original play has a much more complex and interesting plot, actually bringing the racketeers on stage for several scenes, along with the FBI, which is investigating a series of similar attempts at ""fixing"" college sports. In that version, the Russian basketball team isn't even mentioned."

Being very short tempered, he gets easily provoked by the rich, proud Vasu  and his sneering attitude. From glares and snarls to punches and fights, Vasu and Shiva do it all, even for unreasonable, petty things. It is Shakthi  who stops their quarrels before they injure each other very badly. As he is friendly, kind-hearted and cool-headed, Shakthi tries to bring Shiva and Vasu together on friendly terms but in vain. Shiva, Shakthi and their faithful friend Bala stay together through thick and thin and are always ready to voice out their views on behalf of the hostelites in the college. Shakthi’s father  often visits his son in the hostel and is like a father to all of Shakthi’s friends. Meera , the daughter of an M.L.A., nurtures a soft corner for Shiva. She is brave enough to stand up to him and check him when he throws unnecessary tantrums. Shalini , Meera’s friend, is a shy, reserved Muslim girl from a very strict family background. She is often preoccupied with her own thoughts. Karthik  is a total show-off who tries to humiliate Shiva and Shakthi but ends up making a fool of himself. The movie begins on an aeroplane as Shiva  heads back to his college to meet his friends. With his eyes sparkling with nostalgic memories, he takes a trip down memory lane and what he recalls about his college days forms the main part of the story. At the reunion, the friends are happy to see each other after eight long years. But they all seem to be weighed down by a tragic incident: the death of Shakti. Shiva remains the most melancholic of them all. All goes well, until Shiva is found almost strangled to death. Everyone suspects Vasu, but Shakti's father discovers that the murder was attempted by Shalini. In a flashback, it is revealed that Shakti and Shalini were lovers. In an ultimate twist, Shalini reveals that Shiva, who was running away from the police after breaking into an election booth, killed Shakti with chloroform, as the latter suffered from asthma. Shalini is upset that Shakti's father prevented her from taking revenge against the murderer of his son. Shiva is cured and comes to seek apology from Shakti's father for accidentally killing Shakti. Shakti's father forgives Shiva and asks Shiva to marry Meera, who has been waiting for him for over eight years. Vasu also comes to seek apology from Shiva for all of his antics in college. Shakti's parents adopt Shalini, whose family has died, and decide to take her home. The film ends as Shalini says farewell to her friends and to the image of Shakti, who is forever present in the college campus. The message of the film goes for all of us: ""Never forget the sweet memories that happened in college."""

When he approaches his publisher expecting an advance on his newest novel, Tony is told that success has gone to his head and the novel is unpublishable. With few options available, Tony and Dora move to his family's run-down farm in Connecticut, where they meet his neighbors, a Polish farmer, Jan Novak , and his beautiful daughter, Manya . Looking to expand his own property, Mr. Novak offers Tony $5,000 for a field bordering the Novak farm. With their finances replenished, Dora returns to New York, leaving Tony at the farm, where he intends to write a new novel inspired by the Novaks and their friends. Sometime later, Tony and Manya are at his house discussing her betrothal to Fredrik , the young man chosen by her father to be her husband. A drunken Tony tells Manya that she is not in love with the young man, and makes suggestive remarks that anger her. The following day, Tony apologizes to Manya and the two begin a close friendship. After Tony's servant leaves to return to New York, Manya begins spending more time at Tony's farm and the two fall in love, just like the characters in his new novel, Stephen and Sonya. Fredrik soon learns that Manya has been seeing Tony at his farm, and he and her father forbid her from seeing Tony again. Ignoring their orders, Manya continues to spend time with the novelist at his house. One evening, a snow storm prevents Manya from returning home. The next morning, Mr. Novak angrily confronts Tony at his farm. Later, he demands that Manya marry Fredrik the following Monday. When Manya tells him that she will not spend her life being an unpaid servant like her mother, Novak slaps her. Later that day, Dora arrives back at the farm, telling her husband that she missed him terribly during their separation. Dora hears stories about the previous night, but she hopes that they mean nothing, until she reads his new manuscript about the love affair between Stephen and Sonya. On the night before her wedding, Manya goes to see Tony, but finds Dora instead. The two speak about Tony's new novel and how it will end—both realizing that they are really speaking about their own lives. Dora tells Manya that she is sure that Stephen's wife, Daphne, will not give up her husband, but that she would feel sorry for Sonya. Manya tells her about the upcoming wedding, and then leaves. Tony returns home and asks Dora for a divorce, but she refuses, telling him that his novel should end with Sonya marrying her Polish fiancé. The next day, after learning that Manya and Fredrik are getting married, Tony goes to the wedding party and dances with Manya, and then returns home. Later, a drunken Fredrik, angered by his fiancé's lack of passion and interest, storms out of their bedroom and heads over to Tony's house to confront the man he suspects is to blame. Manya follows him to Tony's house, where she attempts to stop Fredrik from fighting with Tony on the stairs. During the struggle, Manya falls down the stairs and is seriously injured. Tony carries her to the parlor, where he tells her he loves her, just before she dies. Later, Dora tells Tony that he can now see Manya privately. Gazing out the window, Tony tells her about how full of life Manya was and imagines that she is waving to him.

When he approaches his publisher expecting an advance on his newest novel, Tony is told that success has gone to his head and the novel is unpublishable. With few options available, Tony and Dora move to his family's run-down farm in Connecticut, where they meet his neighbors, a Polish farmer, Jan Novak , and his beautiful daughter, Manya . Looking to expand his own property, Mr. Novak offers Tony $5,000 for a field bordering the Novak farm. With their finances replenished, Dora returns to New York, leaving Tony at the farm, where he intends to write a new novel inspired by the Novaks and their friends. Sometime later, Tony and Manya are at his house discussing her betrothal to Fredrik , the young man chosen by her father to be her husband. A drunken Tony tells Manya that she is not in love with the young man, and makes suggestive remarks that anger her. The following day, Tony apologizes to Manya and the two begin a close friendship. After Tony's servant leaves to return to New York, Manya begins spending more time at Tony's farm and the two fall in love, just like the characters in his new novel, Stephen and Sonya. Fredrik soon learns that Manya has been seeing Tony at his farm, and he and her father forbid her from seeing Tony again. Ignoring their orders, Manya continues to spend time with the novelist at his house. One evening, a snow storm prevents Manya from returning home. The next morning, Mr. Novak angrily confronts Tony at his farm. Later, he demands that Manya marry Fredrik the following Monday. When Manya tells him that she will not spend her life being an unpaid servant like her mother, Novak slaps her. Later that day, Dora arrives back at the farm, telling her husband that she missed him terribly during their separation. Dora hears stories about the previous night, but she hopes that they mean nothing, until she reads his new manuscript about the love affair between Stephen and Sonya.

Their sense of right or wrong is clouded by this state of complete distrust and self-righteousness. As the story reveals through the hazy mist of confusion confounded by loss off memory, the audience is just shown the tip of the iceberg. Five men wake up inside the stolid confines of a factory to find themselves locked in this claustrophobic nowhere land. As the plot unfolds we gradually learn that two of the people who are trapped have been kidnapped and held hostage by the rest of the three for a heist. But the irony is they themselves do not know who the hostages are and who the kidnappers are. The plot is like a Rubik cube that acquires the contours of solid colours on each side as the narrative unfolds. Their fears are heightened by a phone call from the leader of the gang of goons who informs them that he is on his way with the heist and plans to knock off the two hostages as soon as he arrives. Every one fears for their lives as they are unaware about the fact which two of them are the hostages. They plan escape, fail and end lunging at each other in despair as the clock ticks away. Individual foibles and shortcomings surface in this final hour of despair. Like caged animals they alternately bicker among themselves and then jointly plan means of escape but to no avail. The Big Boss eventually arrives. It is revealed in the end that Sarthak and J.D. are business partners and Sarthak was going to sell their company and in order to avenge that, J.D. plans Sarthak's kidnapping. Romeo is an undercover cop who becomes a part of this plan to get close to the gang headed by Kaiser. In the end, the gang goes to jail and Romeo and Sarthak get back to their lives.

In Italy, James, the Old Pretender, wants to make another attempt at regaining the English throne but is worried that he is too old. It is decided to send his son, Charles. Charles arrives in Scotland and meets Donald, a Scottish shepherd, who he asks to send a message to the Scottish nobles, asking them to meet him at his ship. King George II is warned about the impending invasion but is not worried. Charles tries to persuade the nobles to fight for him and most agree, except for Lord MacDonald, who is concerned about the lack of French support. The clans rally to Charles, including Lord George Murray, and proclaim their loyalty to James. The rebellion begins. Charles is accompanied by another shepherd, Blind Jimmie. Charles and his men enter Edinburgh in triumph. Clementina Walkinshaw throws him a rose and they meet at a dance and begin a romance. General Cope arrives with government troops and Lord Murray does not want to tell Charles about it, thinking little of his military ability, but the prince finds out. Charles recommends they attack and the Highlanders defeat the British at the Battle of Prestonpans in seven minutes. Charles and his forces then invade England. King George II starts to panic and sends his son, the Duke of Cumberland, to fight him. At Derby, only 127 miles from London, Lord Murray and the army council recommend a retreat, as further support has failed to materialise. Charles opposes this but the retreat goes ahead anyway. Charles is upset and seeks solace with Clementina, who encourages him to leave for France with her, but he elects to stay with his men. The Duke of Cumberland defeats the Highlanders at the Battle of Culloden  but is unable to find and capture Charles. Charles flees to the islands with Donald, and is hidden by Flora MacDonald. MacDonald helps him evade the government troops looking for him, during the course of which at one stage he has to dress as a woman. MacDonald keeps Charles' spirits high, and he manages to get on a boat to take him back to Italy.

For some of the team it is their first ever trip abroad, while for others it is the first time they have returned to France since the war. One of the team has developed a plan to buy watches in France and smuggle them back into Britain to sell at a profit. Another, Jim Carver, is going through a rocky patch with his fiancee, who he suspects considers him to be boring and plain. The following day the group meet at London Victoria and catch the boat train to Boulogne. Once they have landed in France, despite the insistence of their unofficial leader the pub's landlord that they stick together, Jim Carver departs to visit a farm where he had been involved in heavy fighting during 1944 when British troops had arrived to liberate France. He takes some flowers to the cemetery where his comrade is buried. He then meets a young woman, Martine, who he first met eight years before, who invites him to have lunch with her family on the farm. They immediately strike up a chemistry, which his relationship with his fiancee in England lacks. However his newfound friend is also engaged to a local lawyer. Back in the town, the rest of the group enjoy a lunch in a cafe and then break up into smaller groups to tour round the town. One goes to try to pick up his black market watches, another gets drunk and joins the foreign legion in spite of their efforts to stop him. One of the group becomes violent homesick despite having left England only hours before. After attempting to, and failing to retrieve their friend from service in the foreign legion the group begins to drift towards the docks and the ship that will carry them on their voyage home – and wonder what has happened to Carver who has been missing all day. Carver has fallen in love with Martine, and she has broken up with Henri. However they argue and he heads for his ship without her. Unbeknownst to him, his fiancee in London has met and struck up a relationship with an American servicemen during a visit to Hampton Court.

He then meets a young woman, Martine, who he first met eight years before, who invites him to have lunch with her family on the farm. They immediately strike up a chemistry, which his relationship with his fiancee in England lacks. However his newfound friend is also engaged to a local lawyer. Back in the town, the rest of the group enjoy a lunch in a cafe and then break up into smaller groups to tour round the town. One goes to try to pick up his black market watches, another gets drunk and joins the foreign legion in spite of their efforts to stop him. One of the group becomes violent homesick despite having left England only hours before. After attempting to, and failing to retrieve their friend from service in the foreign legion the group begins to drift towards the docks and the ship that will carry them on their voyage home – and wonder what has happened to Carver who has been missing all day. Carver has fallen in love with Martine, and she has broken up with Henri. However they argue and he heads for his ship without her.

They bring with them a large picnic basket full of food that they know Darla can't eat, intending to eat it all themselves after Darla refuses it. When the kids make it to Darla's room in the children's ward, Spanky assigns Alfalfa to stay outside and guard the picnic basket until they're sure Darla's still too sick to eat any of it. While waiting, however, Alfalfa falls for the scheme of another resident of the children's ward - a boy intending to escape from his own tonsillectomy. He offers Alfalfa a dime to change clothes with him while he ""goes for a little walk"", leaving Alfalfa to fend for himself when an orderly comes to collect him for the tonsil operation. While in the elevator, little Gary, who's stowed away aboard the gurney the orderly is transporting Alfalfa on, opens a canister of laughing gas, sending himself, Alfalfa, the orderly, and even the elevator operator into various fits of mirth and odd behavior. Spanky, Porky, Buckwheat, and leonard do their best to try to catch Alfalfa, who, thanks to the laughing gas, is now romping deliriously through the hospital and causing havoc and mischief. When Spanky and the boys finally manage to drag Alfalfa back into Darla's room, a still tipsy Alfalfa hops on her bed and jumps for the chandelier, finally calming down after falling to the floor and knocking a pitcher of water off the dresser and onto his head. Just before finally diving into their picnic, a nurse arrives to deliver Darla's afternoon dish of ice cream . The nurse also offers the six boys dishes of ice cream as well, and when she leaves, they tear into their picnic basket as well, combining ice cream with hamburgers, pickles, hot dogs, and watermelons in such a way that they all end up with horrible stomachaches . The boys are admitted into the hospital for indigestion, just as Darla is released to go home. Darla and her mother promise to visit the boys tomorrow and offer to bring ""some nice presents"", forcing Spanky and Alfalfa to wince and moan ""just bring flowers"" as they are wheeled away for their treatment: one dose each of castor oil.<ref namehttp://movies.nytimes.com/movie/226187/Men-in-Fright/overview |title2008-10-08|work=NY Times}}"

As stewardess Kuzumi Asakura  announces the flight plan, the pilot notices an unusual red color to the sky around them. The passengers also see bloody birds flapping their wings against the plane's windows. The pilot  receives a radio message stating there may be a bomb aboard and is ordered to return home. Co-pilot Sugisaka  checks each passenger's bags, saying that a bag with confidential documents may have mistakenly been loaded on this flight. All the bags are cleared but one man  had no bag. Kuzumi notices an unaccompanied suitcase under a bench. He opens it and finds a rifle. The man suddenly pulls a gun on Sugisaka and orders the pilot to fly to Okinawa. To show he means business, he shoots out the plane's transistor radio, just as it was breaking the news about a UFO over Japan with Japanese and US Air Force fighters in pursuit. Suddenly, a luminous object appears directly in front of the airplane. It passes overhead but knocks out the airplane's controls, causing an engine fire. The plane crashes on an uncharted desert isle. Sugisaka wakes up to find the pilot and hijacker are both dead. He and Kuzumi check for more survivors. They find Mrs. Neal , an American widow; Senator Mano  of the Constitutional Democratic Party; weapons exporter Tokiyasu  and his wife Noriko ; Psychiatrist Momotake ; space biologist Professor Sagai ; and a young man who called in the bomb threat . Taking stock, they find that they are out of water or food and don’t know where they are. The hijacker suddenly sits up, grabs Kuzumi and runs out into the jungle. When the others pursue him they come upon the luminous spaceship. Kuzumi hides, but the hijacker steps into a clearing. Suddenly, he goes blank and start shuffling toward the spaceship. A dark blob oozes towards the hijacker, who’s forehead is suddenly split wide open, causing Kuzumi to scream and pass out. Sugisaka finds the unconscious Kizumi and carries her back to the plane. Dr. Momotake later hypnotizes her to help her tell them what happened. She saw the dark blob crawled into the hijacker's skull through the split in his forehead. Tokiyasu doesn't believe her, but Dr Momotake assures him that Kuzumi is telling the truth. Sagai points out that it could be a flying saucer. Suddenly, the kid who called in the bomb threat goes berserk. He attacks Dr Momotake, who falls off the cliff. Waiting at the bottom is the hijacker. He bites Momotake on the neck and sucks out his blood, turning Momotake bright blue. Later, the survivors discuss finding water in the morning. Suddenly, there is a knock at the door. Mano and Tokiyasu don't want to open it, but Sugisaka does anyway. As he descends the stairs, he sees the hijacker lying on the ground with a big scar on his forehead. Mrs Neal rushes to the hijacker and begs for the others to help him. Against their better judgement, they carry the hijacker inside and dress his wound. Mano has become extremely thirsty. When Mano wants a drink of water from Tokiyasu's canteen, he refuses. Mano and Tokiyasu have been helping each other illegally, Tokiyasu funding Mano's campaign and Mano promising to pressure the committee to accept Tokiyasu's weapons bid, a promise that Mano des not intend to keep. Tokiyasu then uses the rifle to force everyone out of the plane and locks himself safely inside, except for the hijacker. Tokiyasu's screams can be heard outside. Suddenly, they stop and the door swings open. Everyone rushes inside to find Tokiyasu dead, all the blood drained away. Noriko begins to laugh, happy to be free from his abuse, but she starts to cry when she thinks about the way he died. The hijacker later comes out of hiding and carries Noriko off to the spaceship. When they notice her missing, the others go in search of her. At sunrise Noriko is seen standing on a ridge. She starts to speak, but it is not her voice. It is the Gokemidoro speaking. They have come to invade the earth and to exterminate humanity. The Gokemidoro have no more need for Noriko's body, so she plunges off the cliff. By the time the others get to her, she has disintegrated into a shriveled cadaver. Once again, the passengers argue about whether extraterrestrials would invade the earth. Professor Sagai theorizes that the hijacker was turned into a vampire. Mano challenges them to prove there are vampires. They decide to sacrifice someone to the Goke. Mano suggests Mrs Neal, because a foreigner will be less problems later, but she’s against the idea. Sugisaka is against all o fit. The kid knocks from the cockpit door, asking for water, so they let him out. Mrs Neal grabs a rifle and locks Sugisaka and Kuzumi into the cockpit. Mano and Saiga shove the kid outside. They watch the hijacker slowly advance. The kid pulls out the bomb he's been hiding and threatens to blow up the plane unless they let him back in. They don't and the bomb goes off, killing the kid and blowing a large opening in the side of the airplane. It's now evident that the plane no longer provides cover and the bomb blast wounded Professor Sagai. Mano runs off with Mrs. Neal following him. When the hijacker catches up with them, Mano pushes Mrs. Neal to the hijacker to save himself. Neal shoots several times but misses. Finally, the hijacker grabs her, bites her neck and sucks her dry. Back in the airplane, Sugisaka and Kuzumi are packing up supplies while Sagai bemoans faith in humanity. As Sugisaka assures him there is human goodness, they hear a shout. It is Mano and the hijacker is not far behind. They go to help Mano, but he runs past them, locking the plane door behind him. While Mano watches from inside the plane, Sugisaka tosses a bucket of airplane fuel at the hijacker, then sets him on fire. The Gokemidoro crawls out of the burning hijacker, creeps in through the bomb hole in the plane and enters Professor Saiga's forehead. Saiga drains Mano, then turns to Sugisaka and Kuzumi, who try to run. Saiga follows until he is swept off a hill by a landslide. Sugisaka and Kuzumi keep running, while Saiga goes back to the spaceship. Once there, the Gokemidoro crawls out, reducing Saiga to dust. Sugisaka and Kuzumi keep running until they find a highway. Everyone in the cars and nearby city are dead. The Gokemidoro inform them that nothing will be spared. Epilogue: Sugisaka and Kuzumi are wandering on rocky terrain. In orbit around Earth a whole fleet of Gokemidoro spaceships await.

The store sells various items of great personal worth to the residents , and Gaunt demands payment both in cash and in small ""favors,"" usually pranks played by his customers on their neighbors. Gaunt seems to have an innate knowledge of the townspeople and their history, and the pranks exploit their previous rivalries and prejudices, causing them to attack each other. When the normally peaceful townsfolk begin to commit acts of violence and murder, Sheriff Alan Pangborn investigates Gaunt and becomes convinced that his machinations are the source of the unrest. Gaunt is revealed to be the Devil, traveling from place to place, manipulating people into destroying themselves. Acting primarily through a corrupt boat salesman and gambler named Danforth Keeton, Gaunt succeeds in sparking a riot in the town square. Pangborn manages to stop the violence before the town destroys itself, and the townspeople admit their pranks, exposing Gaunt's web of manipulation. Keeton, despondent at the death of his wife earlier in the film, blows up Needful Things with Gaunt inside. Defeated, the mysteriously impervious Gaunt emerges completely unharmed from the burning wreckage of his store, predicts he will encounter Pangborn's grandson in 2053, exclaims ""Bob will be his name"", and departs, presumably to continue his vicious, evil work. He leaves in the same sinister black car , in which he arrived at the beginning of the film."

As she leaves the apartment with the doll, we see the man watching her leave, then dialing someone on the phone. Lisa takes the doll with her on an airline flight to New York City, but when, on disembarking, she sees a man watching her, she becomes worried and gives the doll for safekeeping to a man she'd spoken with on the plane, professional photographer Sam Hendrix . The man who'd been watching Lisa then roughly escorts her away. Later, when Lisa calls Sam to ask for the doll, Sam and his wife are unable to find it. Some time afterward, small-time con artist Mike Talman  and his partner Carlino  arrive at the basement apartment where Sam lives with his wife Susy , who is blind. The two men watch until both the apartment's occupants have left, then enter. The con men have an appointment with Lisa, who'd been their partner in crime prior to the recent imprisonment of both, but they are met instead by Harry Roat, Jr. , whom the audience recognizes as the man who watched and met Lisa at the airport. After discovering Lisa's body hanging in a garment bag, Talman and Carlino want to make a quick exit, but Roat points out that they have left their fingerprints all over the apartment, while he has worn gloves. Roat is then able to prevail upon the two to help him dispose of Lisa's body--he'd caught her going into business for herself, he explains--and to help him try to find the heroin-stuffed doll. Later that day, Susy's neighbor leaves for the weekend, and Sam leaves for a business trip the next morning. Once Susy is alone, the criminals begin an elaborate con game: In order to gain entry into the apartment, Talman poses as a friend of Sam's, Carlino poses as a policeman, and Roat poses first as an old man and then as the man's son. Using first an innocuous story about Sam and the doll, then a darker one implying that Lisa has been murdered and that Sam will be suspected, the men persuade Susy to help them find the doll. Talman gives her the number for the phone booth across the street as his own after falsely warning her of a police car stationed outside. During this time, Susy has grown suspicious of Carlino and Roat, and Gloria , a girl who lives upstairs and is paid by the couple to help Susy with errands, has been going in and out of the apartment, sometimes without Susy's noticing that she is there. After Talman leaves, Gloria sneaks into the apartment carrying the doll, which she stole some time earlier. She tells Susy there is no police car outside, and Susy discovers the doll. Wanting to confirm her suspicions about Carlino and Roat, Susy tells Gloria to go home and watch the phone booth. If a man goes into it, Gloria is to phone Susy, let the phone ring twice, and hang up. Gloria tells Susy she can signal her by banging on the pipes. On Carlino's next visit, after he calls Roat at the phone booth, Gloria sends Susy the telephone signal, and she sends the signal a second time after Susy calls Talman to tell him she has the doll. Finally realizing that Talman is a criminal, Susy hides the doll. When he walks in with Corlino and Roat following quietly, she tells him the doll is at Sam's studio. The criminals leave after Roat cuts the telephone cord. When Susy bangs on the pipes, Gloria comes in and Susy sends her to the bus station in a taxi to wait for Sam. When Susy discovers that the telephone cord has been cut, she prepares to defend herself by putting the criminals in the dark along with her, breaking all the bulbs in the apartment's light fixtures. She also pours a chemical into a bowl. When Talman returns, she refuses to cooperate. Talman has spent the most time with Susy and he has come to admire her for her quiet strength and ability to stand up to the three criminals, despite her disability. He admits to her that he and his confederates are part of a criminal plot and that Sam, as Susy suspected, is completely innocent of any involvement, while Roat is a particular danger. Susy needn't worry, though, Talman says, as he has sent Carlino to kill Roat. However, Roat has killed Carlino instead, and, as Talman prepares to leave, pausing to say something to Susy as he stands in the doorway, Roat stabs him in the back. Intent on acquiring the doll, Roat chains the door shut in the dark apartment, pours gasoline on the floor, and sets a piece of newspaper on fire. A desperate battle follows in which Susy throws the chemical in Roat's face and she forces him to put out the fire. But the battle ends when Roat obtains light by opening the refrigerator, whose door he props open with a rag in the hinge. Susy, weeping, pulls the doll out from its hiding place and hands it to him. While Roat cuts open the doll and gloats over the treasure inside, Susy is able, unnoticed by him, to arm herself with a large kitchen knife. Roat then pushes Susy towards the bedroom, making an ambiguous threat as to his intentions. As he pushes her forward, Susy suddenly turns and stabs Roat in the belly. She flees his grasp, but is unable to escape through the chained door. She stumbles across the floor toward the kitchen window to scream for help, but Roat unexpectedly leaps out from the darkened bedroom and grabs her ankle. Screaming, Susy wrenches free, but the dying Roat doggedly pursues her, using the knife with which she stabbed him to drag himself across the floor. Susy is at the refrigerator, trying to close its door and thus extinguish its light, unaware of the rag that is preventing its closure. She then gropes for the refrigerator's cord, murmuring desperately, ""Where is it?"" As the reeling Roat stands with his last strength and staggers toward her with the knife, Susy's scream merges with the sound of a police siren, and the scene switches to the arrival of police cars outside the apartment. When the police enter with Sam and Gloria, Sam finds an unbroken light bulb and we see the room littered with the bodies of Talman and Roat, but no Susy. Finally, as Sam calls out for her, the door of the unplugged refrigerator moves, and Susy emerges from behind it, alive."

In a final attempt to restore order, the president declares martial law. In 2033, a massive prison camp known as ""the Red Zone"" is built in a desolate city that soon holds over one million insane, violent felons. The United States is declared safe. A dangerous criminal known as the Reaper  has been extracting sarin, which he plans to spill into the nation's water supply. One of the prisoners, FX  secretly films the Reaper with a Wi-Fi digital camera as he discusses these plans, and the state's governor, Reagan Black  finds out about them. Black develops a plan to hold a ""death race"" within the prison system, assembling four teams of racers: * The Severed Head Gang, consisting of Danny Satanico  and Fred ""The Hammer"" , two members of the largest gang in the United States, known for decapitating their enemies. The team is given a customized 1995 town car. * Homeland Security, consisting of Colonel Bob  and Captain Rudy Jackson , formerly honored, but now disgraced members of the United States Army. The team is given a vintage 1943 Willys MB. * Vaginamyte, consisting of Double-Dee Destruction  and Queen B , two serial killers who seduced and murdered over 72 male and female victims. The team is given a yellow Lotus with a black widow spider design. * Insane Clown Posse , whose violent form of hip hop was attributed as indirectly influencing multiple murders, acts of terrorism and a school massacre which resulted in the rappers being convicted for these murders and being dubbed as ""the Charles Manson of their time"". Although the group's music has been banned, it continues to retain a strong fanbase. Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope are given an ice cream truck customized with a meat grinder, machine guns and ""all the bling-bling these two Detroit locals could find"". The race is televised live, hosted by anchors Harvey Winkler  and Jennifer Ramirez . Black offers the teams gathering points for killing loose prisoners, promising freedom to the team that brings back the Reaper—dead or alive. When Danny Satanico suggests that the four teams escape, Black reveals that each team member has a chip implanted in their bodies which would kill any member that breaks the rules, using Satanico to demonstrate. When Insane Clown Posse's truck gets a flat tire, a fight ensues between the teams and loose criminals. In the distance, Violent J witnesses an explosion. The teams investigate, finding the burning Homeland Security jeep with two corpses inside. Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope find FX filming the race. He tells them that there will be an ambush at their first destination, and they let him ride in their van. Each of the teams work together to surprise and kill the ambushers. Metal Machine Man , under the order of the Reaper, kills FX and attacks the racers before being hit by missiles fired by a pair of mysterious men. The teams fix their cars before dispatching. Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope arrive at the Reaper's lair, and successfully infiltrate the fortress, preventing the Reaper and his henchmen from releasing the sarin into the water. The mysterious men arrive, firing a rocket into the room, and reveal themselves to be Colonel Bob and Captain Rudy, who were hired by Governor Black as inside men, and faked their deaths to convince the other teams that they had a chance of winning. Believing the Reaper died in the explosion, Bob and Rudy retrieve his severed hand and leave in Insane Clown Posse's truck. Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope emerge from the rubble. Because Violent J is injured, Shaggy 2 Dope goes after Bob and Rudy alone. The Reaper appears and attempts to release the sarin as Violent J attempts to stop him. The Homeland Security team members arrive at the finish line, presenting the Reapers hand to Governor Black. Shaggy 2 Dope rises from the back of the truck, shooting at Bob, Rudy and the governor. Black presses the button to activate the explosives in the bodies of the Insane Clown Posse team members. The sarin explodes, causing a chain reaction which destroys the country."

In it, she asks him to come visit her back in their home town, because she is dying of an unnamed disease. At first he is reluctant because he had been a suspect in a murder case there years before, but Don decides to go. He arrives and gets a ride to Sonny's house by an eccentric cab driver named Samuel . Don meets Sonny, as well as her strange caregiver Marie . Marie's coldness towards Don makes it clear that she doesn't approve of his presence. Don spends the night, and he and Sonny make love. The next morning, Sonny's Doctor, Lance Pryce  visits. While Marie and Sonny are out, Pryce attacks Don, and after a struggle, Don kills the man, and hides the body in a bed of leaves behind the garden. However, Don had just suffered an allergic reaction to a bee sting, and blacks out shortly after hiding the body. He awakens in the hospital, where Sonny proposes marriage and claims that she had recently spoken to Pryce. Don goes to see his old friend Otis , and tells him what happened. Otis agrees to help Don get rid of the body that night, but when he arrives it has vanished. Sonny rushes out, thinking the men are burglars, and Otis runs off. After an argument, Don returns home for a few days, eventually getting another letter from Sonny asking him to come back to her. He does. Samuel picks Don up again, but they are intercepted and kidnapped by a man named Mel . Mel takes Don to a hotel room, where it's revealed that both Mel and Marie were planning all along to kill Don and take an inheritance Don would receive upon Don's marriage. Don tries to reason with the two stating that there is no inheritance, and that he has no idea what they are talking about. Marie refuses to believe him and tells him to go along with the plan, or they will go to the police about the death of Pryce. With Samuel in Mel's trunk, the four drive back to Sonny's house, and demand that Don go in wearing a wire, threatening to go to the police if he doesn't cooperate with their plan. Upon arriving at the house, Don hastily proposes to Sonny, stating that he was confused before, but realizes now that he loves her. Sonny quickly peels away Don's story, realizes he is wearing a recording device, and calls his bluff. The doorbell rings; It's Marie and Mel, who enter the house. After a long confrontation, Sonny hits Marie over the head with a frozen ham, and kills her. Sonny then grabs the phone and calls 911 for help, stating that a man pretending to be a private detective just killed someone in her house. She tells Don to kill Mel, and Don refuses. She grabs an ax and again asks him to kill Mel, but he refuses. Sonny then asks Mel to kill Don, and a struggle over the ax ensues between the men. Sonny kills Mel with the same frozen ham she killed Marie with, and tries to concoct a story to cover all of it. She tells Don that she'd been planning all along to take a large inheritance from Pryce, not Don, that he had received from a relative. It's also revealed that Pryce was her husband, and that the two were going to kill him together, but Pryce jumped the gun on the scam. Don then tells her that he knows that she wasn't actually Sonny, as he had killed his girlfriend in an accident before leaving town years ago, but gotten away with it. The police arrive and Sonny lets them into the house. They find the bodies of Marie and Mel, and immediately arrest Don. Sonny is taken away in a police car, and the police start to take Don away. The sound of screaming starts to erupt from Mel's trunk. The police find Samuel and question Don about Samuel's involvement. Don asks Samuel to explain his knowledge of the situation to the police. In the ensuing investigation, Samuel backs up Don's story, and it seems that he will be okay. The detective in charge asks him why he would go through all of it if he knew that it wasn't Sonny, and Don answers that he was ""lonely"". Don receives a ride to the bus station from Samuel, who tells him to contact him if he ever needs anything. Don takes Samuel's phone number and boards the bus back home. At home, Don is seen sitting in a chair, a wasp lands on his cheek and the movie ends, leaving Don's fate unknown."

Professor Sauerbruch joins the scene and sends her into the surgical section of the Charité. As the incident is regarded to be an attempted suicide, Olga Ahrends is admitted into the psychiatric section. A severe debate arises between Sauerbruch and the Charité psychiatrist who diagnose a falling sickness, while Sauerbruche recognizes that Olga Ahrends in fact is suffering from a metabolic disease weakening her bones. Olga Ahrends is in danger of being amputated her leg; Sauerbruch, however, can be able to cure her by removing her parathyroid gland. Neither has she to be worried about the operation costs. Within this background story, many further episodes from Sauerbruch's life and work are shown, some of them in flashbacks. During the Bavarian Soviet Republic, he unwaveringly stuck to his professional ethics. As a consequence, he was arrested in order not to be able to help the enemies of the revolution, but was rescued by a young man whose mother Sauerbruch once had operated on. On President Paul von Hindenburgs deathbed, Sauerbruch had to admit himself to the limitations of his profession and to calm down Hindenburg's fears that, after Hindenburgs death, Adolf Hitler, who had been appointed Chancellor of the German Empire by Hindenburg, would swear the army on himself, by telling Hindenburg that one only is able to decide situationally and that it is always easy for history to judge afterwards. The flashback about another Sauerbruch patient is rather of funny nature. It is about a waiter who is worried about the costs he has to pay for his operation but then reacts confused and finally breathes a sigh of relief when he learns that he has just to pay a bill about 1 DM. After end of work, Sauerbruch performs an operation on a male cat because its owner doesn't rely on veterinarians. Between operations, Sauerbruch gives lectures and examines young physicians. So, his time for private time is very limited. Mrs. Sauerbruch conforms uncomplainingly to his puritanic life style. In further flashbacks, Sauerbruch tells about his invention, which makes thorax operations possible. During Sauerbruch's years of study, tuberculosis claimed many victims because it was not possible to perform operations on the patients' lungs. When a window in Sauerbruch's house was damaged during a storm, Sauerbruch came up with the idea of an underpressure chamber, the Sauerbruch chamber, which was to equalize pressure during opening the thorax. The first operation on an old woman failed, as she died. The second operation, however, which was performed on a young opera singer, showed that Sauerbruch had been right with his idea. Also the Sauerbruch arm, which is a forearm prothesis constructed by Sauerbruch, is shown, when Sauerbruch's wife presents him to one of his former patients, who has a Sauerbruch arm and, thus, is able to perform an organ concerto.

As a consequence, he was arrested in order not to be able to help the enemies of the revolution, but was rescued by a young man whose mother Sauerbruch once had operated on. On President Paul von Hindenburgs deathbed, Sauerbruch had to admit himself to the limitations of his profession and to calm down Hindenburg's fears that, after Hindenburgs death, Adolf Hitler, who had been appointed Chancellor of the German Empire by Hindenburg, would swear the army on himself, by telling Hindenburg that one only is able to decide situationally and that it is always easy for history to judge afterwards. The flashback about another Sauerbruch patient is rather of funny nature. It is about a waiter who is worried about the costs he has to pay for his operation but then reacts confused and finally breathes a sigh of relief when he learns that he has just to pay a bill about 1 DM. After end of work, Sauerbruch performs an operation on a male cat because its owner doesn't rely on veterinarians. Between operations, Sauerbruch gives lectures and examines young physicians. So, his time for private time is very limited. Mrs. Sauerbruch conforms uncomplainingly to his puritanic life style. In further flashbacks, Sauerbruch tells about his invention, which makes thorax operations possible. During Sauerbruch's years of study, tuberculosis claimed many victims because it was not possible to perform operations on the patients' lungs. When a window in Sauerbruch's house was damaged during a storm, Sauerbruch came up with the idea of an underpressure chamber, the Sauerbruch chamber, which was to equalize pressure during opening the thorax. The first operation on an old woman failed, as she died. The second operation, however, which was performed on a young opera singer, showed that Sauerbruch had been right with his idea. Also the Sauerbruch arm, which is a forearm prothesis constructed by Sauerbruch, is shown, when Sauerbruch's wife presents him to one of his former patients, who has a Sauerbruch arm and, thus, is able to perform an organ concerto.

Saccard sees an opportunity to rescue his failing bank, Banque Universelle, by financing the solo transatlantic flight of Jacques Hamelin, a pioneering aviator, and then capitalising on his popularity to set up a colonial business project in Guyane. He also hopes to seduce Hamelin's wife Line in his absence. When a rumour circulates that Hamelin has crashed, Saccard exploits the false reports to manipulate shares at the Bourse. Gunderman disapproves of Saccard and his methods, and has secretly bought shares in his bank as a future weapon against him. The Baroness Sandorf, a former lover of Saccard, acts as a spy to assist Gunderman's interests, and more particularly her own. Hamelin's work in Guyane becomes an expensive liability, and his failing eyesight prevents him from keeping adequate control of the accounts. Saccard ensnares the naïve Line in mounting debts which compel her to tolerate his attentions. Incited by Sandorf, Line makes a formal complaint about Saccard's financial dealings, which launches an enquiry, and when she discovers how her husband's reputation has been compromised by Saccard she tries to shoot him at a party. Sandorf now restrains her, fearful for her own investments if Saccard were to die. Gunderman sells his shares in Saccard's bank and precipitates its collapse. Saccard is arrested, along with Hamelin who has returned to France. Saccard's duplicity is exposed in court, and through Gunderman's intervention Hamelin is released. Saccard goes to prison, but wastes no time before planning new financial schemes - with the aid of his gaoler.

The following day, Sidney Prescott returns to Woodsboro to promote her new book with her publicist Rebecca Walters. Sidney becomes a suspect in the murders after evidence is found in her rental car, and she must stay in town until the murders are solved. Her cousin, Jill, who is dealing with the betrayal of her ex-boyfriend, Trevor Sheldon, gets a threatening phone call from Ghostface, as does her friend Olivia Morris. Jill and Olivia, alongside their friend Kirby Reed, are questioned about their calls by Dewey Riley, who is now the sheriff of the town, while one of his deputies, Judy Hicks, assists him in the case. Meanwhile, Dewey's wife, Gale Weathers-Riley, is struggling with writer's block. She gives up the writing and decides to investigate the murder instead. Sidney stays with Jill's mother, Sidney's aunt Kate Roberts. Later that night, Olivia, who lives next door to Jill and Kate, is attacked and murdered by Ghostface as Jill and Kirby watch in horror. Sidney and Jill rush in to save Olivia, but they are injured in the attempt and are taken to the hospital. In the hospital's parking garage, Ghostface murders Sidney's publicist Rebecca. Gale, trying to solve the murders, enlists the help of two high school movie geeks, Charlie Walker and Robbie Mercer, who explain that the killer is using the rules of movie remakes to murder. Charlie concludes that the killer will likely strike at a party being held that night. Gale goes to the party to investigate. Ghostface injures her but flees when Dewey arrives. Dewey takes her to the hospital. At Jill's house, Sidney discovers that the policemen assigned to guard the house are dead. She also discovers that Jill has left the house and gone to Kirby's. Sidney goes down to tell Kate, but the killer appears, kills Kate, and disappears again. After Deputy Judy Hicks arrives, Sidney rushes to Kirby's house to save Jill on her own. Jill, Kirby, Charlie, Robbie and Trevor are at Kirby's house when Ghostface appears and murders a drunken Robbie. Sidney arrives at the house. Kirby is forced to answer horror movie trivia to save Charlie, who is tied up outside. Sidney goes upstairs to find Jill, promising to return to Kirby. After Kirby answers Ghostface's questions, she goes outside to untie Charlie, believing that she has won the game. He suddenly stabs her in the stomach and reveals himself as Ghostface, before leaving her for dead. Sidney is confronted by Charlie and a second Ghostface, who is unmasked as Jill. She explains that they want the attention Sidney got for surviving the murders, and that they intend to frame Trevor as Ghostface; she then pulls Trevor out of a closet and shot him in the head. Jill then betrays Charlie and kills him too, to pin him as Trevor's accomplice, making her the sole survivor. Jill stabs Sidney in the stomach and mutilates herself to make it seem as if Trevor attacked her. Later, Dewey, Judy, and the rest of the police stumble upon the carnage. Jill is then taken to the hospital. After discovering that Sidney had survived, she goes to Sidney's hospital room and attempts to finish her. Dewey, Gale, and Judy intervene, having been clued by a detail about Gale's injury that Jill somehow knew. Jill subdues Sidney's rescuers, which gives Sidney the chance to shoot her in the chest, killing her. Dewey calls in all police units, as media reporters outside confirm Jill as the ""sole-surviving hero""."

Paul tells his best friend, the schoolteacher Truson , also played by Johnson, but Truson is skeptical. The town of Hamelin has entered a competition in order to win a banner from the King. To this end, the Mayor  exhorts the people to work incessantly, even the children, to the extent that they are denied school and play. Truson protests, but his protests go unheeded by the arrogant Mayor. As part of a competition between several villages, the Mayor and his cabinet plan to construct golden chimes to impress the King's Emissary, who is due to pay a visit to Hamelin. But their efforts are temporarily halted when the town is invaded by rats, which have fled the neighboring city of Hamelout after the Weser River flooded and destroyed the town. It is then that the Piper magically appears before the Mayor and his councilors.  Asking to be paid all the money in the town's treasury,  he offers to rid the town of the rats. An unusual element is introduced into the story here: whenever the Piper plays a happy tune for the children, only Truson and the children can hear it. When he plays ""In the Hall of the Mountain King"" and leads the rats to their doom in the river, the children quickly fall asleep and only the material-minded adults such as the Mayor, but not Truson, can hear the music. The Piper rids the town of the rats, but rather than simply paying him, the Mayor and his Cabinet attempt to use legal pettifoggery to trick him into an agreement whereby he must deposit a certain amount of money as a guarantee that the rats will not return, and if they do he must return the rest of the money that he has been paid. Furious, the Piper leaves without his money, and the Mayor plots to use the gold to construct the chimes. Truson, who is in love with the Mayor's daughter Mara  is thrown in jail for speaking out against this injustice. The Mayor plans to marry off Mara to the King's Emissary , but at this point, the Piper takes his revenge. Playing a happy variation on ""In the Hall of the Mountain King"", he leads the children of Hamelin away and into a beautiful kingdom concealed by a cave which magically opens to let the children in. But Paul is accidentally left behind, after he falls while trying to catch up with the other children and the cave closes before he can pass through. The rest of the plot concerns the resolution of the Truson-Mara love story, the attempts of the adults to bring back the children, the Mayor's repentance, and the Piper's forgiveness. A happy ending was added to the poem in order to keep the program a family special.  The poem's storyline was greatly embellished in order to pad it out to ninety minutes. The characters of Truson, Mara, and the King's Emissary, as well as several bit roles, were invented for the film, as were the happy ending and the storyline about the town entering a competition to win a banner from the King. In the poem, however, the mayor still tries to trick the Piper over the payment for ridding the town of rats. In Browning's original poem, and in the original legend on which the poem was based, the children never do come back."

He is a brilliant and deeply emotional man, devoted to his wife and children. Darwin is especially fond of his eldest daughter Annie, a precocious and inquisitive ten-year-old. He teaches her much about nature and science, including his theory of evolution, and tells her stories of his travels. Her favourite story, despite the sad ending, is about the young orangutan Jenny, who is brought from Borneo to the London Zoo, where she finally died of pneumonia in the arms of her keeper. Darwin is furious when he learns that the family clergyman has made Annie kneel on rock salt as punishment for contradicting him about the existence of dinosaurs, as their existence and extinction contradicts the church's position that life is unchanging and that the Earth is very young. Having returned from his expedition in the Galapagos Islands 15 years earlier, Darwin is still working on finishing a manuscript about his findings, which substantiates his theory of evolution. The delay is caused by anxiety about his relationship with his devoutly religious wife, Emma, who fundamentally opposes his ideas and understands the threat to their religion that his work poses. Emma worries that she may go to heaven and he may not, separating them for eternity. The film shows Annie in flashbacks and hallucinations, a vibrant apparition who goads her father to address his fears and finish his masterwork. It is apparent that Annie has died, and that her death is a taboo subject between Darwin and Emma, as both feel intense blame for her death. As a result of the strained relations between Charles and Emma, they stop making love entirely. Anguished, Darwin begins to suffer from a mysterious, fatiguing illness. It is revealed that after Annie becomes ill in 1851, Darwin takes her to the Worcestershire town of Malvern for James Manby Gully's water cure therapy, against Emma's will. Annie's condition worsens, and she ultimately dies after her father, at her request, tells her Jenny's story once more. Darwin is devastated, and her death sharpens his conviction that natural laws have nothing to do with divine intervention. To his contemporaries, this is an idea so dangerous it seems to threaten the existence of God. In a box in Darwin’s study, we discover the notes and observations that will become On the Origin of Species. Having read his 230-page synopsis, Darwin's friends in the scientific community, Joseph Dalton Hooker and Thomas Henry Huxley, also encourage him. Huxley admiringly tells Darwin that with his theory he has ""killed God"", which fills Darwin with dread. In his hallucinations, he also feels that Annie disapproves of his procrastination. Darwin receives a letter from Alfred Russel Wallace in 1858, which details the same findings as Darwin in 20 pages. He has mixed feelings about this; all his work may have been in vain, but on the other hand, as he will not have to write his book, the discord with Emma will heal. However, Darwin's friends will him to continue, as his book is much more comprehensive. After receiving treatment at Malvern himself, Darwin makes a pilgrimage to the hotel where Annie died. The journey marks a change in him; upon his return home, he is able to reconnect with his wife, and they speak to each other for the first time of their fears and grief over Annie's death. They specifically speak about the possibility that Annie died because she was genetically weak, as Darwin and Emma are closely related cousins. Their renewed devotion restores Darwin's health, and he is able to resume his work, as it also restores Emma's faith in their marriage, and she regains her strength to support his controversial work. Darwin decides that Emma must make the decision about publishing his work. After reading the manuscript, she quietly returns it addressed to John Murray publishers in London. Emma accepts that she is an ""accomplice"" now, but hopes that God will forgive them both. Darwin walks down the lane, holding the package. When the postman arrives, Darwin falters, almost letting him go empty-handed. The postman rides away, unaware of the powerful idea about to be released onto the world. As Darwin walks home, the little figure of Annie walks alongside him."

Both men have been hired to train the animals for a film called Frizzy, The Bichon Frise: Sal as the dog handler, and Eddie is given only the responsibility of training the lizard. When Frizzy is kidnapped, Sal quickly claims that Eddie was responsible for the dog handling. Eddie is promptly fired. The director refuses to pay the ransom and decides to instead hold auditions for the new Frizzy. Meanwhile, Eddie's son, Billy Bob, is walking around town when he discovers a large, stray dog is following him. Billy then brings the dog home and names him Beethoven after the dog shows interest in Ludwig van Beethoven's 5th symphony, after initially trying to call him Wolfgang. Eddie comes home to discover that, not only is his job gone, but now his house is wrecked by an oversized dog adopted by his son. Will soon learns that the one responsible for Frizzy's disappearance is Sal, accompanied by his two other cronies. He admonishes them for not waiting until Frizzy had already shot some of the movie, in order to make her valuable. The next day, when auditions are held, the director has trouble finding the right dog to replace Frizzy. Eddie has arrived  to pick up his lizard, Pete. Suddenly, Beethoven bursts in and performs an impressive chase scene with Pete the Lizard, which instantly makes the director love him. Beethoven and Eddie are hired on the spot, and Sal is sacked. To celebrate, Eddie takes Billy and Beethoven out for hamburgers, but Beethoven escapes with the burgers and leads Eddie and Billy on a chase. Finally, they find where Beethoven was going: he had been caring for his three small pups in an alley, as their mother had apparently died. In Beethoven's 2nd, she wasn't heard from again. Eddie begrudgingly adopts the puppies, as well. Eddie is then charged with having Beethoven perform the requested stunts in the movie. Unfortunately, Beethoven proves to be ""untrainable"", and instead, often crashes through the scene and making a sloppy mess in the process. Each time, Eddie is prepared to be fired, but the director finds these scenes even more funny and orders the scenes printed for the film. Lisa, the film's writer, requests from Eddie to spend more time with Beethoven so that she can write more appropriately for him. As revenge for being fired, Sal orders his henchmen to kidnap Beethoven for the million-dollar ransom, planning to kill him after the ransom is paid. They kidnap him while Billy is flirting with his crush in the park. Eddie, Billy, Lisa, and the puppies then head to Sal's show stage, which doubles as his secret lair, and rescue Beethoven. Sal and his goons are arrested, and Eddie and Lisa begin a relationship. The film ends with Eddie, Lisa, Billy, Katie, Beethoven, the pups, and Pete the iguana, all enjoying snacks while watching the film's premiere. The end credits have movie title parodies.

His grandniece, Zoe, is a child passionate with the fairy tale knights, especially the Silver Knight Gothic, and upon hearing her uncle's distress, flees the castle in search of a knight. Eventually Zoe is attacked by a pair of Jimbob dragons, and Lian-Chu, a roving dragon hunter, rescues her, leading Zoe to think that Lian-Chu is a knight.

They decide to go to the castle, whereupon the blind Lord approves Lian-Chu's bid as a knight, and briefs him on the World Gobbler .

Mistaking her for a schoolteacher, outlaw Frank Calder  and his band of rustlers and thieves kidnap Melissa, not for ransom but because Calder wants to be taught how to read a book. Traveling by luxurious private train, the hunting party engages in debauchery with women, one of whom Ruger sadistically abuses. Notified that his wife has been taken captive, Ruger arms his friends with high-powered rifles to begin a hunt not for animals but for men. Calder twice must keep Melissa from being raped by his men. But eventually he overpowers and rapes her himself. Melissa tries to shoot and stab Calder and to flee, each time in vain. She goes on a hunger strike, but cannot resist the temptation of a jar of peaches. She begins to enjoy Calder's company. Using rifles with telescopic sights that can allow shooting a target at 800 yards, Ruger and his men begin to pick off the outlaws one by one. Melissa also stabs one, Hog Warren , after he attempts a second time to rape her. Calder charges within close range and is able to shoot one of Ruger's men.

Calder's men become upset to discover that they have kidnapped such a powerful man's wife, placing them in danger for no good reason. The men revolt and Calder kills one.

Alone now, Calder and Melissa are driven out into the desert. Weak from heat and thirst, their horse dead, they stumble toward an inevitable fate. Ruger materializes on foot.

She goes on a hunger strike, but cannot resist the temptation of a jar of peaches. She begins to enjoy Calder's company. Using rifles with telescopic sights that can allow shooting a target at 800 yards, Ruger and his men begin to pick off the outlaws one by one. Melissa also stabs one, Hog Warren , after he attempts a second time to rape her. Calder charges within close range and is able to shoot one of Ruger's men. Two others quit the hunting party when they see Ruger's lack of concern over their friend's death. Calder's men become upset to discover that they have kidnapped such a powerful man's wife, placing them in danger for no good reason. The men revolt and Calder kills one. When his own best friend, Doc , is gravely wounded, Calder obeys a last request to put Doc out of his misery. On his death bed, Hog Warren further angers Ruger by telling him Melissa is now Calder's woman. In yet another ambush, Ruger sees for himself that Melissa, rather than trying to escape, leaps onto Calder's horse voluntarily to ride off with him. Ruger's last remaining ally, Matthew , implores him to let her go, but the crazed Ruger pays no mind. The last of Calder's men are gunned down from long-range at a water hole. Alone now, Calder and Melissa are driven out into the desert. Weak from heat and thirst, their horse dead, they stumble toward an inevitable fate. Ruger materializes on foot. He fatally shoots Calder with his rifle. As Calder is dying Ruger kills Melissa. Ruger then collapses beside them. The credits roll over what appears to be a sepia photograph of three bodies in the sand.

LaGuardia founded the High School of Music & Art in order to provide a facility where the most gifted and talented public school students of New York City could pursue their talents in art or music, while also completing a full academic program of instruction. In 1948, the School of Performing Arts was created to provide training in performance skills to students who wished to prepare for professional careers in dance, music or drama.  Students learn on the first day of classes that their teachers expect them to know everything. In dance class, the teacher Ms. Kraft is worried about Kevin's dancing, but is easily impressed by Alice. In acting class, Jenny feels uncomfortable to let loose and be crazy like everyone else. In music class, Mr. Cranston gives Victor pointers, while Denise plays the music perfectly on the piano. In the lunchroom, everyone practices their major and they all get up and dance , while Denise and Malik escape the madness and they talk to each other, Denise saying that her uptight and conservative parents thinks that the school is ""people sitting around, practicing cello all day"", and that they would die if they saw this. Malik reveals that his mother doesn't even know that he is coming to the school for she's a junkie and drunkard who doesn't care about his or anyone's lives. Just before freshman year ends, it shows Malik at his apartment, his mother finding his report card, making it clear that he goes to P.A. She is angry but he continues to go to the school. The year closes after she goes to work and leaves Malik standing alone.  As the new school year begins, it shows the dancers all practicing in a circle, but once it is Kevin's turn, he is out-shined and is forced to go back in his original spot. In music class, Victor is having trouble sticking to the right music, and adds his own spin on whatever he is playing, which doesn't sit well with Mr. Cranston. In theater class, Malik talks about his dead sister, Ayanna, causing Mr. Dowd to ask questions that he refuses to answer. Malik then leaves, stating that he's going to be famous, no matter what anyone else says. Meanwhile, Denise is playing her classical piano, but then starts to sing, assuming she is alone.  When she leaves, it is revealed to the audience that Malik was watching the whole time. He brings her to Victor and convinces her to sing for the album that they are producing. She agrees to it, as long as her strict father doesn't find out. At a Halloween party, Malik plays the song, but says the vocals are ""anonymous"", upsetting Denise, which confuses Malik. Later, Joy is in Central Park drinking beer. She gets up and does a rap, vomiting at the end of it. Neil captures this in his documentary and presents it to the class. Marco asks Jenny out on a date . She agrees to go with him to dinner at his father's restaurant, where she convinces him to play a song and sing on the piano. He does , and she gives him a money tip. The sophomore year portion of the movie ends with them kissing.  Joy has another audition, but is annoyed, because the other girls competing against her always seem to get the part. Neil says that he is meeting with a producer for a short, independent film he wrote and hopes to direct himself. Meanwhile, Marco and Jenny go to a party, where Jenny sees a guy named Andy Matthews, a former P.A. student who claims to be a professional actor and known player. He tells her that he can have her meet with his agent, and the naive Jenny gives him her cell phone number. Marco leaves, having seen the last part, and Jenny runs out after him. They have a minor fight, but she promises that she will never talk to Andy again, and they go back to her house. Victor, Malik, and Denise meet with a man from a record company, who says that their demo is interesting, and he will play it at the next meeting and get back to them. Victor and Malik are overjoyed, but Denise is still hesitant. At the next meeting, the producer tells them that Denise is the reason he was interested in their music. He tries to persuade her to stay. Joy tells Jenny and Neil that she got a part-time acting job on 'Sesame Street' and is very excited about it. Ms. Rowan, the voice teacher, takes some of the students to a karaoke bar where she ends up singing as well. Jenny goes to meet Andy despite what she said to Marco. When she arrives, Andy tells her the director is out sick. He comes onto her, but she stops him and angrily leaves. She tells Marco, and he asks if Andy tried anything, saying that he knew this would happen and that if fame was really that important to her then he hopes she gets the job. He then leaves her sobbing his name on a rooftop. Neil tries to get his equipment for the movie, but when he tries to find his producer, he is discovered to be gone, along with the $5,000.  Kevin has a meeting with Ms. Kraft, the dance teacher, because he asked her to write him a letter of recommendation. She says she can not write him the letter, because she believes he is not talented enough to become a professional dancer. Meanwhile, as they talk, Alice is dancing to  practicing her jazz piece. This conversation with Ms. Kraft causes him to attempt suicide by stepping in front of a subway car. Joy, Rosie, and Jenny are there to stop him. Victor is told by his girlfriend, Alice, that she is going on a world tour next week. He asks if she will visit him, but she says that after P.A. couples usually go their separate ways. Joy drops out of school before graduation because she is working on 'Sesame Street' full-time now and her grades have suffered. Malik talks with Mr. Dowd about his father, which leads to Mr. Dowd telling him about breaking down his walls. Victor, Malik and Denise put on a hip-hop concert at a club at which her parents are at, but Denise told them it was classical jazz because of her father's wishes for her to pursue classical piano and not vocals. Despite this, she defies her father and goes on anyway and wins over her mother during the performance. Marco, along with Neil, Joy, and Rosie, is there to watch but when he sees Jenny come in, he says he has to go. Jenny stops him from leaving, saying that she's been thinking a lot about him, and that it kills her that she hurt him. Later, during the concert, he puts his arms around her and they smile at each other. When Denise leaves with her parents, her father is outraged and tells her that he is pulling her out of P.A., even though she is about to graduate. Her mom stops him and says that if Denise wants to sing, she should sing.  Before graduation, Jenny gives a speech about success to the graduating class, saying that she felt it when she was in the school. Kevin tells Joy that he is moving back to Iowa, and that he is going to be the best damn dance teacher there's ever been. During the graduation performance, everybody participates , with Denise as the main singer. It ends with all the characters following graduating ."

Filmmaker Henry Ferrini uses archival footage of Olson, as well as an array of interview subjects, including actor John Malkovich, to paint a picture of Olson and his life. Throughout the course of the film, Olson struggles to save Gloucester, Massachusetts, his home town, from progress, which in his opinion was taking away the town's very essence. Henry Ferrini is a native of Gloucester himself, and feels the way Olson does about the issues of progress. Polis is This encourages viewers to appreciate where they come from and educates them about the extraordinary possibilities that exist in the ordinary things that exist around them in their daily lives.{{citation needed}} Author Jim Harrison has called the film ""sublime"" and ""simply stunning."" Russell Banks has called the film ""an invaluable contribution to our literature.""http://www.polisisthis.com/press.html"

Despite having been free of alcohol and other drugs for seven years, along with his pop-star girlfriend Jackie Q , when, in an interview, she drunkenly declares they have a boring life, he relapses—which effectively ends his relationship with her, makes him lose custody of their son, Naples, and sabotages his career. Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, Aaron Green  works as a talent scout at Pinnacle Records, a successful record company. He lives with his girlfriend, Daphne , a doctor. Pinnacle Records is performing badly as a result of poor record sales, and the head of the company, Sergio Roma , asks for ideas. Green proposes that Aldous Snow play at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles on the tenth anniversary of his legendary performance there in 1999. Sergio sends Aaron to London to escort Aldous to the performance. Before he leaves, Daphne informs Aaron that she has received a job offer in Seattle and that they are moving there, which leads to an argument resulting in an apparent break-up. After retrieving Aldous from his apartment, Aaron learns that Aldous hadn't been expecting him and that he had thought the concert was not for another two months. They then bar-hop across the city and Aaron futilely tries to get Aldous to catch one of many missed flights. Daphne calls Aaron to apologize for the fight, only to learn that Aaron believes that they are broken up. Throughout his partying, Aaron's cellphone accidentally calls Daphne periodically, informing her of Aaron's activities. Aaron and Aldous travel to New York for Aldous's appearance on Today. To keep Aldous sober for his performance, Aaron imbibes all of Aldous's whiskey and marijuana. Minutes before the performance, Aldous realizes he is unable to remember the lyrics to his most recent and unpopular song, ""African Child"", and replaces it with an older hit, ""The Clap"", to cheers and excitement from the audience. About to embark on a flight to Los Angeles, Aldous forces Aaron to smuggle heroin in his rectum. During their travels, Aaron learns that Aldous has become miserable and lonely, as he misses his son and has been alienated from his own father Jonathan  for years. Aaron suggests he visit him after the show; instead Aldous insists they go to Las Vegas to see Jonathan. Sergio soon arrives, with plans to ""mindfuck"" Aldous to Los Angeles. Sergio hooks up Aaron with a sexually violent girl named Destiny , who takes him to a hotel room and rapes him. After Aaron tells Aldous that he has been raped, Aldous gives him a ""Jeffrey"", a joint described as ""a Neapolitan of drugs"". Aaron panics and starts to have a bad trip, believing he is having a heart attack. Jonathan makes the trip worse by agreeing that Aaron is having a heart attack while Aldous attempts to calm Aaron down, primarily by the comforting sensation of stroking the furry walls of the hotel suite. Aldous fights with his father; Sergio  jumps in the fight, and inadvertently sets the lounge on fire. Aldous attempts to help Aaron by giving him an adrenaline shot and they run out of the hotel, chased by Sergio, who is hit by a car but comes out unharmed. Aldous and Aaron flee to Los Angeles, where Aldous visits Jackie Q. She has been sleeping with Metallica's drummer, Lars Ulrich  and confesses that Naples is not actually his biological son, but instead is a photographer's son. This depresses him even further. Meanwhile, Aaron goes to his home to apologize to Daphne. They are interrupted when Aldous arrives at their house and proposes that he, Aaron, and Daphne engage in a threesome; Daphne  agrees and Aaron hesitantly goes along. During the threesome, Aaron angrily decides to kiss Aldous, breaking it up. Daphne and Aaron both immediately regret the threesome, and Aaron angrily tells Aldous to go, criticizing Aldous's overall mental state. Instead of preparing for his show, Aldous goes to the rooftop of the Standard Hotel in downtown Los Angeles, and calls Aaron, threatening to jump. Aaron rushes to the hotel, and attempts to coax Aldous down from the roof. Instead, Aldous jumps into a rooftoop pool several floors down, accidentally breaking an arm. Aldous tells Aaron that he is lonely, sad and embarrassed, but Aaron reminds Aldous that thousands of fans love him and are waiting just to see him. Aldous decides to perform at the Greek Theatre despite his injury, even though Aaron pleas for him to go to the hospital. Upon their arrival, Sergio offers Aaron drugs to give to Aldous so he will not cancel the concert. Aaron, tired of the abuse Sergio has given him, refuses and quits his job on the spot, much to Sergio's dismay. Aaron walks stage-side with Aldous, trying to convince him to go to the hospital instead. However, Aaron sees how happy Aldous is while performing and heads home to reconcile with Daphne. Months later in Seattle , Aldous, sober once again, has returned to fame with a single ""Furry Walls"" produced by Aaron  based on events from their night in Las Vegas, performing on the VH1 Storytellers program."

After enduring his first day of junior high school, Kevin is befriended on the bus ride home by a sweet girl  who offers him a sympathetic ear. She drops her pencil and Kevin picks it up, only to find that the girl has vanished. Her name is inscribed on the pencil - Tracy Donnelly. The next time Kevin sees Tracy on the bus, she gives him a bus safety manual and begs him to read it. The other kids wonder who he's talking to. Then Kevin finds out that Tracy is a ghost. She died in a bus accident, and what's more, she used to live in the same house as Kevin. The bus safety manual goes unread, so an invisible Tracy haunts Kevin at home while he's working out. Through some nicely done special effects, she moves his weights around and floats the manual over to him. Finally, he agrees to read it. The next time Kevin sees Tracy on the bus, she explains that she never read the bus safety manual, so she didn't know what do to save herself and others when the time came. Then, suddenly, a pickup truck strikes Kevin's bus, knocking out the driver and sending the bus hurtling off the road and dangling over the edge of a cliff.  Remembering what he'd read,  Kevin gets all the kids safely off the bus. Then he revives the driver and gets him out. The bus plunges off the cliff and crashes. Kevin is a hero, the kids cheer him, but he's forgotten about Tracy.  Refusing to believe that Tracy went down with the bus, Kevin scours the area. Finally, she calls out to him. He sees her, she waves him a sad goodbye, and vanishes, fading away before his eyes. Kevin is heartbroken.

Trudi  and Rudi  are an affectionate, long-married couple whose children have grown up and moved away. They live in a small Bavarian village. Trudi learns that her husband is terminally ill. The doctor suggests a final adventure, which the two wanted to have for some time, but never managed. Trudi decides to keep the disease secret from Rudi. She manages to convince him to visit their children and grandchildren in Berlin. But when they arrive, they realize that their children are too busy with their own lives to take care of the parents. Then they decide to drive to the Baltic Sea. But there, Trudi suddenly dies. Rudi is thrown completely off track and doesn't know how to go on. After he learns from a his daughter's girlfriend that Trudi has actually sacrificed her life out of love for him, he starts to see his dead wife with new eyes. Rudi tries to make up for the loss of his wife. As her secret passions were Japan and the Japanese Butoh dance expression, Rudi travels to visit his son in Tokyo. As the situation gets too claustrophobic, his son wishes his father to go away. Then Rudi goes to a park full of cherry blossoms. He meets an eighteen-year-old Japanese girl named Yu . She catches his eyes because she dances Butoh there every day. Yu lives in a tent and has lost her mother only a year ago, so she understands Rudi's feelings. She helps him get by in the big city.

Her parents, Frank and Joanne, give all their attention to her 19-year-old sister Gail, who just found out she is pregnant by somebody she has no interest in marrying. Frank is infuriated and Joanne is worried about Gail, so they forget to spend time with Casey. They think of her as the good girl who doesn't cause any trouble. Feeling ignored, Casey starts wanting to look like the girls on the covers of magazines and begins working out and dieting as well. One day, Casey's friends convince her to join a ballet lesson. Casey is noticed by the teacher, Madame Seurat, who tells her she could be very good if she loses a few pounds. It doesn't take long before Casey becomes a starving anorexic who occasionally purges. She is surprised when her parents don't take her desire of professional dancing seriously, but doesn't give up her dream. Over the next two months, Casey becomes obsessed with dieting and improving in ballet. This causes her school work to deteriorate, which brings attention from her parents. When her sister really sees how thin Casey is, she warns her parents. Casey is sent to a doctor who orders her to start eating normally again, threatening to send her to a hospital if she doesn't. Despite the pressure, Casey is afraid to gain weight and continues her eating disorder secretly. When her parents discover diet pills, Frank tries to force her to eat, but she refuses to do so. When she returns home from a party she tries to convince her parents that she ate at the party, but Frank isn't convinced and tries to shove a peanut butter sandwich in her mouth, but she bites his hand. After her parents take the pills from her, Casey steals a package at the pharmacy the next day. However, she is caught and is arrested. After her parents bail her out, she collapses outside the police station and is taken to the hospital. She tries to run away, but collapses yet again outside the hospital and is taken back. In the hospital, she befriends fellow patient Carol Link. Carol is also suffering from anorexia and bulimia and gives Casey advice about how to get kicked out of the hospital and also teaches her tricks to mislead the doctors. At one moment, Carol overdoses on pills and Casey witnesses her dying. Crushed and devastated, she runs away, but collapses for the third time. When she becomes conscious again, she is angry that she is back in the hospital. She tells her doctor, Clay Orlovsky, that she is afraid to die as well, but he assures her that is not going to happen. When Casey improves, she is finally allowed to see her family again. Dr. Orlovsky analyzes their meeting. He tells the family that he thinks Casey has developed an eating disorder because it seems to be the only way for her to get attention. After a while, Casey finally recovers and is released from the hospital. She doesn't want to leave, however, and feels safer with Dr. Orlovsky. In the final scene, she eats ice cream without disliking it.

After many attempts, only one experiment was successful and now the unsuccessful ones are given drugs every day to keep them from regressing into their animal forms. They are also controlled with electrical shock devices to keep them in order. However, one of the creatures tears the shock device from his body and when he informs others of this, the animal hybrids break loose on the island. One of Dr. Moreau's allies is Dr. Montgomery, a physician gone mad with devotion to Moreau and intense drug abuse. United Nations negotiator Edward Douglas, the sole survivor of an airplane crash, is brought ashore on Moreau's island — against his better judgment — by Dr. Montgomery, and eventually becomes his prisoner. Horrified by the doctor's monstrous experiments and fearing for his own life, Douglas seeks the help of Moreau's lovely daughter, Aissa, in escaping the island, but is foiled at every turn by Dr. Montgomery and his man-beast lackeys.

They arrive uninvited at a party hosted by a former high school classmate of theirs. After finding out that their classmates have grown up and moved on with their lives, Coop and Remer find themselves outside drinking beer and shooting hoops on the driveway basketball court. There, two other former classmates challenge them to a game. The two see that their opponents are very good at basketball, so they say they will only play a new game they picked up ""in the hood"". Clearly making this new game up as they go, Coop originally proposes the game Horse, but changes it to basketball with baseball rules: shots made from different locations count as singles, doubles, triples, and home runs, and missed shots count as outs. During the challenger's first shot, Coop ""psyches"" him out to make him miss; this is another rule made up on the spot. A ""psyche out"" can be anything said or done that makes the offense lose their concentration and miss their shot. Essentially ""BASEketball"" is a hybrid of ""Horse,"" ""Around The World"" and a lot of trash talking. Coop and Remer continue playing their new game, ""BASEketball"", and add a third member to their team, Kenny ""Squeak"" Scolari . Six months later, people come from miles around to watch them play the game they created against other neighborhood teams. Ted Denslow  shows up to propose creation of the National BASEketball League , with numerous rules in place to prevent the sport from deteriorating as other sports had done: teams cannot switch cities, players cannot be traded, and individuals cannot make money via corporate sponsorship deals. Five years after creation of the league, the NBL is in full swing with stadiums, teams, fans, and a major championship . During the 1997 championship, Denslow, who is the owner of the Milwaukee Beers for whom Coop and Remer both play, chokes on a hot dog and dies. Denslow's will grants Coop ownership of the Beers for one year; if they do not win the next Denslow Cup, ownership reverts to Denslow's widow Yvette . The owner of the Dallas Felons, Baxter Cain , wants to change the league rules to allow teams to move cities and players to switch teams, but could not accomplish this while Denslow was alive. Yvette would have been willing to comply had she been given ownership of the team, but Coop refuses to accept any of the proposed changes. Cain and Yvette work together to make sure the Beers will lose the next Denslow Cup and Yvette will win ownership of the team. In a private conversation at Cain's office, Cain tells Remer that Coop has said no to Cain's plans without talking to the other members of the Beers. Remer then goes to the Beers behind Coop's back and tells the team what he learned from Cain. After Remer and the other members of the Beers confront him, Coop agrees to split all decision making with Remer and the team. The team continues to agree that the rules should not be changed. Coop also seemingly enters into a relationship with Jenna, despite Remer's attempts to get between them. Cain cuts the funds to Jenna's foundation, forcing Coop and Remer to ask Cain for help. Cain suggests creating a clothing line and sending the proceeds to her foundation. Coop is entirely against it, but Remer, as part team owner, immediately agrees, and becomes so obsessed with his newfound fame that he alienates Coop. After they win the league semifinals, Cain informs Coop and Remer through photos that their clothing line has been produced through child labor in Calcutta. If the public learns about it, the team and Jenna's foundation will be ruined. Cain threatens to show the photos to the public unless Coop and Remer lose or skip the Denslow Cup game. Jenna learns about the child labor scandal and breaks it off with Coop. Coop blames Remer for the mess and they have a falling out, and Coop decides to go to Calcutta to resolve the situation. Coop replaces all the child workers in the factory with adult workers and makes it back just as the fifth annual Denslow Cup begins. The Beers start with an abysmal performance, failing to make one hit in six innings. At the seventh-inning stretch, the Beers are down 16&ndash;0. After a moving speech from Squeak, Coop and Remer reconcile their differences and Yvette breaks off her alliance with Cain. Coop, Remer, and Squeak finally get back into the game and start scoring. In the bottom of the ninth, Remer is on second, Squeak is on third, and Coop is up when his custom-made BASEketball  pops. Joey brings Coop a new custom-made BASEketball made from a Barcalounger. Coop misses, but successfully completes the conversion, which is considered a home run for the win and the Denslow Cup. He meets Reggie Jackson after the game, who wishes him luck in the next season. Coop and Jenna reunite while Remer hooks up with Yvette, as the team happily carries Squeak on the Denslow Cup."

As the mice engage in various activities such as card games and playing the harmonica, Sylvester marches outside as the guard cat, discouraging any mouse that would dare escape. In the village, the señorita mice are crying about family members and boyfriends having gone missing . The mayor of the village attempts to recruit volunteers to help rescue their villagers, but realize the situation is hopeless because Sylvester is too fast and smart for them. Then, one of the mice suggests calling on Speedy Gonzales to help with the rescue effort. After realizing that he is on vacation in Guadalajara, another mouse comments that Speedy ""would come all the way from Guadalajara to visit my seester Carmella."" With that, Carmella is recruited to place a long-distance call to Speedy; seconds after the call is placed, Speedy races to the village to begin the rescue effort. Speedy walks into the patio to great fanfare, much like a bullfighter before his fight, drawing Sylvester's attention. The mouse directly taunts the ""gringo pussy gato,"" and Sylvester—perhaps thinking Speedy is the latest attempted would-be rescuer in an apparent long line of hapless victims—sarcastically obliges. Speedy instantly races past Sylvester and rescues Manuelito; the cat's attempt to snare them in a rope trap fails, as Speedy's quick pace pulls Sylvester through the knothole of the wall he is hiding behind. Sylvester's other encounters with Speedy include: * The cat's attempt to crush Speedy with a large rock . Speedy then smuggles out several more mice in a tin can and hides behind another rock and in between three cans. Sylvester looks under all three cans, the final one concealing a dynamite stick that explodes in his face as the mice make their getaway. * Speedy sneaking out several more mice using a dachshund costume. One of the mice briefly is separated from the group, but is able to catch up, and Sylvester crashes into the fence. * Speedy using a set of train tracks and cars to bring the rest of the mice home. Sylvester tries to hide behind a tunnel along the tracks, but the train simply goes through the cat's body and exit through his tail. The cat cries in frustration. Here, Speedy refers to the escape as like ""Atchison, Tabasco, and Santa Fe"", a pun on the song On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe.

Several survivors have evacuated to the elementary school to wait for more survivors to arrive. A senior named Sean Ryan calls his friend Vicki at a coffee shop, who tells him that the shooter is Ben Harris, a friend of Sean's. Sean is left speechless. The film then flashes back to the morning before the massacre. A student named Jason is being bullied and is struggling to pick up his books, but then Sean helps him. Sean reminds Jason that school is almost over and that he shouldn't let the bullying get to him. The two then go into their school, Jefferson High School; both are seniors there. It is a Monday, and Sean, his best friend Nick, and a few other students, are working on the school play. Sean learns that his friend Ben Harris, who works the lights, is absent, so Jason substitutes for him. Later, during a lunch period, Sean talks to his math teacher, Martin Blackwell, about the crush he has on his friend, April Lauren. Mr. Blackwell tells him to let her know how he fells about her. Suddenly, the fire alarm rings, and everyone assumes that it is a senior prank. However as they leave, they hear low rumbling. Mr. Blackwell and Sean then see a group of students, running for their lives and screaming. Three gunshots are heard, and everyone immediately realizes that someone is shooting off a gun inside the school. Mr. Blackwell takes a group of students back into his classroom to hide, while Sean and Nick decide to flee with their lives, taking a panicked girl named Samantha  with them. Meanwhile, Jason is left to fend for himself, but he does manage to make it out of the school, carrying out the body of a dead girl in the process. Mr. Blackwell eventually decides to take his group of students and flee, but as they do, the shooter shoots him in the back from behind. Mr. Blackwell tells the students to run, but one student, Jonathan, instead drags Mr. Blackwell back into the math classroom. Jonathan attempts to save his life, but after several minutes, Mr. Blackwell tells him to wait in the closet until help arrives. Sean, Nick, Sam, and a few other students including their friend Mike, stumble upon a suburban area where the injured  have evacuated. While searching for April, Sean runs into April's best friend Jessica, who tells him that the police are having people go down to the elementary school. Sean, Nick, and Mike then decide to go with him. Meanwhile, a S.W.A.T. team enters the school through the main entrance. A single gunshot is then heard, implying that the shooter has committed suicide. While searching, the police find Jonathan, but Jonathan is shocked to learn that Mr. Blackwell has died of his wounds. Jonathan throws a tantrum and blames himself for not doing anything to save him. The film then returns to the beginning scene, where Sean learns that the shooter is Ben. Sean is shocked after learning this, but Nick takes it the hardest, refusing to believe that Ben would cause any trouble. The last group of survivors then arrives, and Sean searches frantically for April. However, a teacher, Sally Reedman, comes in and informs Sean that April is dead. Over the course of the film, the film splits into two separate stories. Sean struggles to cope with April's death, and Jason learns that the security cameras at school captured him carrying the dead girl out, and that he is being hailed as a hero. Later, Sean learns that fourteen people, including Mr. Blackwell, April, and Ben, are dead. April's car is turned into a memorial, and a TV executive, Helen Mann, tries to help Jason cope with his dilemma by introducing him to Sam, believing she was the girl that Jason carried out, but Jason says that it wasn't her. The next night, as everyone learns Ben's motives for the shooting, Sean has a flashback about how when he was unable to tell April about his feelings for her. This flashback causing him to break a mirror, cutting his hand in the process. Sean's father later takes him home. Meanwhile, Jason's situation spirals out of control, causing him to have a mental breakdown in the middle of a grocery store. He later reveals to Sean that he doesn't believe himself to be a hero because he feels that he is responsible for the death of Matt, a student who bullied him. Later, Nick is released from police custody after falsely being suspected of helping Ben plan the shooting. He says goodbye to Sean and he and his family move away. Meanwhile, Jason commits suicide, unable to take any more of his ""fame"". At April's funeral, Jessica gives Sean April's diary. After Sally, Jessica, and Sean perform eulogies for their fallen friend, Sean goes to April's grave and starts crying, ending the film. During the credits, the list of several school shootings from the past  are shown, along with the victims of the massacres. A message is then shown about how officers are now trained to set up a perimeter and move towards gunfire in a school shooting situation since Columbine."

Justine, a sweet and virtuous girl lives with her sister Juliette in a nunnery. When they learn of their father's death, they are booted out of the nunnery with their father's remaining gold. Juliette takes Justine to a friend, Madame de Buission who could provide accommodation for the two girls. De Buisson turns out to be a brothel owner and requires the girls to work as prostitutes to pay for the accommodation. Justine refuses and leaves the brothel with her gold while Juliette stays and learns the arts of a prostitute. Justine meets a priest who offers to keep her gold safe and return it at the church the next day, should she reside with Monsieur Du Harpin. Du Harpin does not know the priest however, but agrees to let Justine stay for free if she agrees to serve as a maid. Justine is spotted by Monsieur Derroches , who takes interest in Justine's beauty and invites her to sleep in his quarters. He forces himself on Justine, who escapes but is instructed by Du Harpin to steal Derroches' valuable gold amulet. The next day, Derroches summons the police, who search the area and find the amulet in Justine's belongings. Justine is taken to prison where she meets Madame Dusbois, a virago sentenced for execution the next day. Dusbois, impressed by Justine's innocent looks, implicates her in an escape plan. The next day, Dusbois' accomplices  start a fire in the prison and Justine screams, causing a commotion in the prison. Using the chaos as cover, Dusbois and Justine escape the prison safely. Meanwhile, Juliette and a fellow prostitute named Claudine kill Madame de Buisson one of her clients, stealing her gold and making their escape. While hiding out in a forest, Dusbois accepts Justine as part of her group, noting the utility of Justine's innocence. But the male members of the group attempt to rape Justine and end up fighting amongst themselves. Justine uses the distraction to escape. She faints near the house of a painter named Raymond who takes care of her. He offers to let her live with him for free, in exchange for her becoming a model for him to paint. Justine falls in love with Raymond and lives happily with him for a duration. One day, the police arrive at Raymond's while searching for Justine and on Raymond's request, Justine escapes into the woods. Justine arrives in the premises of the cunning Marquis de Bressac, who, impressed by Justine's innocent air, gives her refuge and employment. Justine becomes a personal attendant to Marquise de Bressac, who owns all the de Bressac property. The Marquis asks Justine to kill his wife or be framed for a crime. Justine reveals the plot to the Marquise, but the Marquis knows this secretly. Later, the Marquise attempts to poison her husband, but the latter tricks her into drinking his wine, killing her. To punish Justine, the Marquis brands the letter 'M' for Murderess on Justine's breast. Meanwhile, Juliette and Claudine have made great profits from vice and crime. To obtain her share of the fortune, Juliette drowns Claudine while the latter is bathing in a river. Justine meanwhile, arrives at a chateau where four ascetics - Father Antonin and his Order are living a life of meditation and study. Justine asks for sanctuary there and is accepted by the Order. She learns however, the four men are libertine hedonists and sexual deviants, whose four other female servants are in fact, sex slaves. Justine ends up chained and tortured in the dungeon. One day, Father Antonin notes how her life of righteousness and virtue has not gifted her pleasure and reward, but instead brought her to endure suffering. He suggests that Justine's sense of pleasure is enduring this suffering, to which Justine agrees. Pleased at having learnt their philosophy so swiftly, Antonin plans to ""release"" her by killing her in torture during a ritual. The ceremony goes awry, and Justine escapes in the commotion. Raymond finds Justine unconscious on the road and takes her to a nearby city, where he lets her stay temporarily in an inn. Madame Dusbois, who is serving in the same city with her accomplices as an amusement show host, spies Justine and takes her away to work as a nude show performer. During the show, Justine's brand reveals her to be a murderess and causes an uproar in the venue. As she is being taken away by the police, she is spotted by Juliette, now a mistress of a Minister of the King. Juliette describes her wicked life as empty, and says that Justine will earn her reward for a virtuous life despite her sufferings. Juliette takes Justine away to live with her in her palace, and Justine is seen walking away peacefully with Raymond."

At the hospital, she receives good care, but seems distant from her caretakers. While she stays in the hospital, she meets a boy named Daniel and the two have a pleasant conversation. Meanwhile in the rest of the hospital police officers Einar and Kim discuss Jannicke's situation and investigate her last known location at the hotel where they discover several bodies nearby including the mountain man's and has it sent back to the hospital. At the hospital, Officer Sverre flirts with the local nurse Audhild while Nurse Camilla tries to uncover Jannicke's story. It is also revealed that Jannicke has been suffering nightmares from her previous encounter with the mountain man and even goes as far as attacking the mountain man's body in the morgue, much to the surprise of her caretakers. They decide to drug her to keep her calm after her emotional outburst, much to the protest of Nurse Camilla. During this time, the police investigation continues as they begin to discover more bodies. However, at the hospital the mountain man shows sign of life and is frantically resuscitated, much to the horror of Jannicke who violently attempts to stop them but is tranquillized in the process. The doctors manage to successfully bring the mountain man back to life and leave him under watch by Sverre. Eventually the mountain man wakes up, murders a distracted Sverre, and breaks free. He then proceeds to go in a killing spree across the hospital while a recently awoken Jannicke escapes the hospital in the aftermath with Daniel and Camilla while locking the mountain man in the basement. They proceed to rendezvous with officers Kim, Ole, Einar and Johan outside. After being told to stay outside by Einar, who has been investigating the mountain man's background, Jannicke watches nervously as he enters the hospital with Ole and Kim accompanying while Daniel is taken away by his mother. Inside, the officers fail to find the mountain man and decide to pull back from the hospital but are side tracked by Johan's radio message revealing the location of Sverre's body. After finding said body, the officers are attacked and all but Ole are killed in the ambush. After watching gunshots within the hospital, Jannicke offers to enter the hospital with Officer Johan. However, this plan is interrupted when the mountain man attacks, wounding her and killing officer Johan as well as frightening Camilla. The remaining two are then saved by a severely wounded Ole who dies of his wounds distracting the survivors allowing the mountain man to escape. Enraged, Jannicke travels to the hotel where the first movie occurred and falls asleep waiting for the mountain man. The mountain man eventually appears and seems to have the upper hand over Jannicke but is defeated when Camilla arrives. Not satisfied with the mountain man being stabbed through the chest by his own pickaxe, Jannicke ensures the mountain man's death with a shotgun blast to the head.

The movie recounts his inspiring love story with his activist wife, Milly, and the dramatic change in their lives in the years after she is diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. As a young journalist in Chicago in the '60s, Mort Kondracke envisioned marrying a Vassar graduate whose status would facilitate his goal of becoming a top Washington journalist. His calculated plans go awry when he meets and marries Milly Martinez, a brash part-Mexican, part-Catholic, part-Jewish liberal activist who captures his heart. In Washington, D.C., the loving, strong-willed partners build a passionate and volatile marriage while debating everything from politics to how to raise their two daughters as well as her insatiable, all-consuming desire to save the world by championing a never-ending list of causes—all overshadowed by Mort's struggle with alcoholism. In 1987, their lives take a dramatic turn when Milly notices a change in her handwriting and a numbness in her fingers. After a series of tests, her worst fears are confirmed and, at the age of 47, Milly is diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. Holding to his promise of ""in sickness and in health,"" Mort changes his focus from being a die-hard careerist to becoming a devoted caregiver and Parkinson's advocate and the love between the couple grows stronger.

He is single and lives with his mother . He is often bullied into doing ridiculous amounts of office work by his boss Das Gupta . Amar has a recurring stomach problem and has been informed by the doctors that he possibly suffers from an ulcer. But, upon further investigation, he is informed that he is suffering from stomach cancer which is currently in its second stage. He only has three months left to live. He returns to his normal routine of work but is disillusioned by the fact that his boss is extremely unsympathetic towards his plight as he missed doing some paperwork. He goes to a bar in order to drink alcohol for the first time in his life, where he meets an anonymous young man , who describes his risky way of living life, including coming to the bar to drink even though his doctor has warned him not to owing to a bad liver condition. The next day, while making his regular list of priorities for his day-to-day life and office work, he is confronted by his soul, an Amar look-alike who ironically is dressed up in the same way the young man at the bar the previous night was. His soul criticizes Amar for going on with his regular, boring life despite knowing his time is up. Inspired by this, Amar sets up a priority list of the things he needs to do before he dies. First on his wish-list is a new car and so he applies for a company loan, which is promptly rejected by his boss. Finally enraged, Amar deletes all the files that he has completed for Das Gupta and pours an orange drink on him. Sacked but also boosted by a new compensation package, Amar finally buys a new car. He shows interest in the car's sales woman  but learns later that she already has a boyfriend. His soul confronts him again and tells him that if he wants love, he should look no farther than Neha Bhanodh , his childhood crush, to whom he has been struggling to convey his love to for years. At the same time, Amar begins to take lessons from veteran guitarist Savio  in order to fulfill his childhood dream of mastering the art of playing the guitar. Since Savio's niece works in a telephone company, Amar asks for Savio's help to track down Neha. He meets Neha but discovers that she is happily married with a kid. After spending some time with the family, he leaves but is again confronted by his soul who calls him a coward. Finally, under pouring rain, Amar gathers courage to walk up to Neha, and using sign languages familiar to them back from their childhood, confess his hidden feelings for her all along. Looking happy at his new-found courage, Amar contacts his long-lost best friend Rajiv Julka , who's a doctor currently staying in Thailand. By visiting Rajiv, Amar fulfills his wish of going on a foreign trip and also meet with his best friend. However, shortly after he reaches Rajiv's house, he overhears Rajiv's wife Suchi  suggesting that Amar has come for free treatment. Hurt, Amar leaves the house and starts wandering the streets, where he is approached by a group of Russian call-girls. One of them, Tatyana  offers herself for a night, but while trying to wave her away, Amar spills his hotdog ketchup onto her, causing the group to beat him up. Totally wrecked by the events, Amar weeps uncontrollably, labelling the whole idea of fulfilling his dreams as 'a joke'. Finally, Amar decides to commit suicide, but is stopped by Tatyana. Both of them do not understand each other's languages and struggle to communicate as Amar is desperate to jump and end his misery, when Tatyana finally slaps him in order to calm him down. She brings him to her house where he finally has a decent meal. Tatyana asks Amar about his native country, and Amar replies ""Mumbai, India"" to which she exclaims ""Bollywood!"" Amar nods and Tatyana reveals that she has the records of old Hindi film songs and starts dancing to them, asking Amar to join. Even though initially reluctant, Amar finally joins in, and Tatyana passionately kisses him and then leads him to her bed. Thus, possibly, Amar who has been celibate all his life finally manages to enjoy pleasure in the arms of a woman. Subsequently, Amar finally finds one of the most difficult things on his wish-list, love, in the form of Tatyana. Despite finding it hard to communicate, they maintain their relationship and spend days with each other. Finally, Amar calls Rajiv and calls him to the airport as he is about to return to India. As a parting gift Tatyana presents Amar a Led Zeppelin T-shirt to which he responds that even he plays the guitar. He says 'Dasvidaniya' as he waves goodbye to Tatyana. He bids farewell to Rajiv as well, despite Rajiv urging him to stay as he can help find a solution to Amar's disease. Rajiv asks Amar to keep fighting and not to succumb. Amar returns to India, and as a first measure of ensuring that his mother is taken care of after his death, makes peace with his brother Vivek , a TV serial director, who had long ago left the house after marrying someone whom their mother disapproved of. Amar reveals his disease to Vivek and requests Vivek to care for their mother after his death. His mother also overhears this and this brings the whole family together. Even though Amar's mother kept dragging him to self-certified yogis and faith healers to help cure Amar's cancer, the three of them constantly spent quality time together. Finally mastering the guitar with the help of Savio, Amar manages to perform a song for his mother and brother before finally dying. It is later revealed that Amar has left behind gifts for all the significant people in his life. He gifts his car to Savio, the guitarist, given the fact that Savio doesn't have a car and struggles to travel everyday for his own performances, while gifting the guitar ironically to his boss Das Gupta, probably as a sign that Das Gupta needs to release some tension through music. He also gifts Neha his carefully preserved copy of their childhood album, and through Rajiv, leaves behind the DVD of a Bollywood movie for Tatyana. In his will he also specifies that his apartment is to be lent out to the sales woman who sold him the car, along with her boyfriend. He significantly leaves no gift behind for Rajiv, probably an indication of the theme of their friendship  Rajiv however decides to keep Amar's wish-list with him. On reviewing the list Rajiv tells Vivek that Amar managed to complete nine out of ten from his wish list, which isn't bad . To this Vivek responds by telling Rajiv that before his death, Amar had already made arrangements for his obituary to be printed on the third page of the local newspaper, which means that all ten of his wishes on his list eventually came true."

It's his birthday, yet he's not very happy. His mother tells him to address her current boyfriend as ""God Father"", much to his dismay. The mother's boyfriend is fishing at the back of the boat. As soon as he catches a fish, he tells the mother to run and get a net. When she says she can't find it, he puts the fishing pole in a holder and runs up to find the net in a rage. The child walks down and sees the pole jerk from the fish's attempts to escape. He feels sorry for it, and takes a pair of pliers and cuts the line. The man comes back and slaps the boy across the face, accidentally sending him into the sea. His mother runs over and pushes him in after the boy, telling him that her son can't swim. It turns out the man can't swim either, so all the mother can do is cry desperately for someone to help her son. Meanwhile, underwater, we see the orange tail of the fish that the boy saved and long, flowing hair. The next moment, some people find the boy is found on shore. He says he was rescued by a big fish. Many years later, the effects of the boy's accident still plague him, preventing him from bathing without breaking down in fear. This causes his mother to bathe him herself with force. After yelling at his mother for forcing it upon him, he runs out the door for a job interview as a Judo teacher at the local high school. The principal refuses him at first because of his good-looks, but later accepts his offer when he is given a sob story about all the other schools turning him down for the same reason. The principal tells him to avoid flirting with the girls, and to also be careful around Ms. Yuen, who is considered the local hottie . At his first Judo class, Chi meets Kenji, the sometimes-boyfriend of Kiki, a girl who the school calls ""Princess"". Kiki shamelessly flirts with Chi, which leads to him being scolded by the principal. One day, as he takes his class out to the docks, Chi is pushed into the sea by one of his students after one of Kiki's followers  is violently shoved into the water. He sinks and loses consciousness. Soon, out of the shadows, arrives a beautiful mermaid with an orange tail and long, flowing hair, who turns out to be the same mermaid that saved him long ago. She takes him to shore and turns into her human form and then steals a woman's clothes that were lying on the rocks. Feeling they were destined to meet, she releases a pearl from her stomach and uses its power to revive him. Just then, she's frightened by the sound of people approaching, and her pearl is shoved down Chi's throat in an attempt to hide its brilliant glow. It's the woman that the mermaid stole the clothes from and her boyfriend. They notice Chi and help him. Seeing that he is safe, the mermaid attempts to return to her home under the sea, but she soon realizes that without her pearl, she can't dive down to her home. She decides to follow Chi and take her pearl back. While on shore, she is mistaken for a man's niece, and takes on the name ""Siu May"". She attends the school where Chi works, and attracts the attention of Kenji and Kiki. Kiki befriends her at first, but soon becomes jealous when she starts getting more attention than she does. Not being able to stay out of water for too long, ""Siu May"" must ""recharge"", i.e. bathe in water. One day, Ms. Yuen goes into the girl's bathroom to wash her hands and hears one of the showers running. When she goes to see who it is, she's shocked to see only the orange tail of a fish and faints. Luckily, Siu May's face was hidden by her hair. Kenji runs in to see what was wrong and discovers Siu May. She makes him promise not to tell anyone, and the two quickly become friends. As Siu May continuously attempts to get her pearl back from Chi, they too seem to be getting closer. They soon share a kiss, and Siu May decides to teach Chi how to swim, on the condition that he wear a blindfold. That night, they swim around in the school's swimming pool. The next few days, Kiki gets increasingly jealous of Kenji hanging out with Siu May more than with her. A misunderstanding on Chi's birthday leads to Siu May thinking that Chi is cheating on her, causing her to take back her pearl and run away from him in the pouring rain. She soon transforms, and Chi falls to the ground in shock. At this moment, Ms. Yuen, the principal, a policeman, and a man who caught Siu May in his swimming pool, run up and take Siu May away. After snapping back to his senses, Chi enlists the help of Kenji and a now reformed Kiki to rescue Siu May. They find her in the swimming pool of the unnamed man, with an electrical fence over it so she can't escape. In an act of desperation, Kenji and Chi end up pushing a guard standing guard over Siu May into the electric fence, killing him and causing the fence to run out of juice. They rescue Sui May and get away. In the next morning, they come to the docks, and Siu May says her goodbyes. Now that her pearl is back, there's no reason for her to stay. Except for Chi. He bravely declares his love to her and says that he'll wait for her, and she promises to be back someday. She jumps into the sea, transforms, waves goodbye once more, and swims gracefully away into the murky depths of the sea. The principal, Ms. Yuen, and the other men wait patiently for Siu May to return as Chi is so that they can capture their ""Big Fish"" and become rich. One day while following Chi around, they see him bump into a bridesmaid who looks identical to Siu May at a wedding. She throws the bride's bouquet and hits Chi on the head. The principal takes a hose from a nearby gardener and starts spraying Siu May. Chi shields her with his body while Kiki and Kenji fight off the principal and take the hose away from him. Eventually, the girl slips up and reveals that she is Siu May. Chi invites her to eat clams with him, but warns her it'll be hot. She says, ""I don't mind."" They run to each other and embrace, Chi swinging Siu May in his arms and Kenji and Kiki watch happily. The film ends with the pair swimming in the ocean as the movie's theme plays."

Among the audience is a girl named Courtney Lane . Interspersed with the scenes of the band playing, singer Nikko Alexander  calmly walks into the club through the back, barely making his cue for ""Don't Tell Me"". At the end of the song, he kicks over one of the amps, destroying it for effect. After the performance, the other members of Flux, upset by his carelessness, kick him out of the band; Nikko's girlfriend Amy , who is also in the band, dumps him. After the band members leave, Courtney frantically attempts to recruit Nikko into a show choir named ""Spectacular!,"" of which she is leader. Though Nikko is skeptical and condescendingly rejects her offer, Courtney begs him to come to a carnival to see the choir perform and then make his decision. The next day at the carnival, Nikko arrives in time to see the Spectacular! show choir perform ""Eye of the Tiger"". Afterward, the ever-anxious Courtney once again attempts to persuade Nikko, who is less than impressed by the group's performance and style, to join the show choir and help them win a national contest, even offering him half the group's earnings from the contest in exchange for his consent. Nikko declines to join the group, stating that he isn't interested in choir. Soon, another show choir named Ta-da performs ""Things We Do for Love"". The lead singers are Royce , who used to be the lead singer for Spectacular! but quit after breaking up with Courtney, and Tammi , Royce's new girlfriend that is a snobby, selfish girl. Later on, Nikko meets with and performs for a famous music producer named Mr. Dickenson, who informs him that he has a shot at getting a record deal if he can raise enough money for equipment for his demo, which has to be excellent. Nikko recalls Courtney's offer of half the earnings from the contest Spectacular! plans to perform in, and decides to join the choir in order to get the money to pay for his demo. When he approaches the choir Courtney remembers his mockery of their carnival performance and initially refuses to let him join, but acquisces after Nikko demonstrates his talent by performing ""Break My Heart"" in front of the whole group, who are impressed by his vocals. When they are practicing, however, Nikko finds out that dancing for show choir is not as easy as it looks and cannot easily pick up the dance routines. Nikko, who lives with his older brother Stavros , does not inform his brother that he has joined show choir or that he is attempting to get a record deal because he knows Stavros would not approve. Several days later the group, dressed in hideous cowboy costumes, goes to perform at the club Nikko and his old band, Flux, had performed at in the beginning of the movie. There Nikko runs into his old band members, leading to an awkward confrontation and a lot of mockery from SLaughtered Brains. Meanwhile, Ta-da, who are also at the club, performs their song ""Lonely Love Song"". Nikko discovers from the other Spectacular! members that Royce is Courtney's ex-boyfriend. Upon witnessing Ta-da's good performance and the snobby attitudes of Tammi and Royce, Nikko becomes determined to help Spectacular! win the upcoming competition and begins to think that the group should come up with new dance moves and new music. One day, before Courtney arrives for choir practice, Nikko encourages the other choir members to try things a different way, and performs ""Your Own Way"", persuading the others to join in. Though they are initially reluctant to go against Courtney's wishes, the rest of the group eventually agree that they need a new routine in order to win the competition. They later meet up at Nikko's house, unbeknown to Courtney, and Nikko begins to teach them new dance moves, stating that if they perform the song in front of Courtney she would be impressed and may agree to change the group's style. The choir assembles at Nikko's house every night to practice while still attending practices with Courtney every afternoon. Nikko learns of Spectacular!{{'}}s tradition of gathering for a bowling night the week before a competition. Only four members, including Nikko and Courtney, show up at the bowling alley, where they discover that Tammi and Royce are already bowling in their lane. After a brief confrontation between the two groups, Nikko persuades the others to perform a song using ""Rock The World,"" a spoof of the real-life video game Rock Band. Random selection chooses a song called ""For the First Time"", which was Courtney and Royce's old duet. She and Nikko sing it, much to Royce's jealousy, and Nikko and Courtney are becoming attracted to each other. Nikko invites Courtney over to his house for a surprise, and when they get there the whole group has assembled on Nikko's rooftop, where they all perform ""Your Own Way"" for Courtney. Courtney, instead of being impressed, is upset, accusing Nikko to have betrayed her by practicing another routine behind her back,and then leaves. Later that night, Nikko goes to Courtney's house to apologize and almost has a fistfight with Royce, who has come to ask Courtney to get back together with him. Courtney rejects Royce, who tauntingly tells Nikko that Ta-Da will beat Spectacular! at the competition in the ""weirdest trash talk that [Nikko's] ever heard."" After Royce leaves, Nikko apologizes to Courtney for taking control of the group behind her back and offers to do things her way, but Courtney admits that the group needs a change. Courtney's mother tells Nikko that he can bring some good and change to the ""Spectacular!"" group and that Courtney will know how far they are actually able to push the envelope to win. The two of them decide to combine their talents and perform a song that everyone can agree upon, and Mr. Romano , their music teacher, suggests a song called ""Something to Believe In"". Spectacular! begins intense rehearsals and all seems well , until Mr. Dickinson pays Nikko and Stavros a visit and informs them that his boss is offering Nikko and Flux a record deal after an audition and will only be available on Saturday night. Knowing that Spectacular! is scheduled to perform at the concert on Saturday night, Nikko is torn between his commitment to the choir and his one shot at getting a record deal. He tries to inform Courtney of his decision to audition for the record deal, but cannot bring himself to do it. Meanwhile, Amy informs Stavros that Nikko has joined choir and Stavros confronts Nikko in front of the members of Spectacular!, insisting that Nikko drop out of choir and audition for the record deal instead. The other members of Spectacular! are upset at Nikko for bailing on them at the last minute, and Courtney feels that Nikko has betrayed her again. Mr. Romano visits Nikko, who is having a tough time deciding what to do, at his house and reveals that he was once in a famous band as Joey Rome that could have been more successful if he hadn't flopped and broke his contract due to his fear of taking risks. Before leaving to go audition for the record deal, Courtney shows up. Nikko fears that she is mad at him for turning his back on ""Spectacular!"" but instead she kisses him on the cheek and wishes him luck. On concert night, Ta-Da performs ""On The Wings Of A Dream"" and earns much applause and acclaim from the audience. Meanwhile, Nikko and Slaughtered Brains perform at their audition for the record deal, but Nikko's heart is not in it and the producers notice and tell him they are not interested; Stavros says that Nikko is just warming up, and that he is better than what he is giving out. Nikko begs them to let him show where his ""heart is."" When it is Spectacular!s turn to sing ""Something to Believe In"" at the national competition, Nikko, much to Courtney's surprise and delight, arrives onstage right before the chorus, belting out a long note. Flux joins him, playing background music, and Mr. Romano reprises his dream as a rock star by playing a guitar during the song. Nikko and Courtney reconcile, and the group earns a standing ovation. Ta-Da is announced as the winner of the contest and Spectacular! is disqualified because Nikko and Flux were performing as unregistered members of the act. Tammi reveals to Royce that she had only used him to win the contest and breaks up with him. Even though Spectacular! lost the contest, Nikko's amazing performance got him the record deal. After everyone leaves, Nikko and Courtney share a kiss. It ends with Spectacular!, Slaughtered Brains, and Mr. Romano in a studio together recording a song, suitably named ""Everything Can Change"", with Nikko and Courtney as the lead singers in the song."

Novak and Julie find Janice's corpse and pull it onto the boat, capturing a lone piranha, which they take to Carl Goodman , a marine biologist who works as a pet store owner. He explains that it is a super-aggressive prehistoric species, long believed to be extinct. Julie, Novak, Fallon, and Deputy Taylor Roberts  try to evacuate the lake, but their warnings are ignored until the piranhas begin to attack the tourists. Novak boards a jet-ski with a shotgun to help while Fallon drags people to shore and Julie and Taylor try to get swimmers into the police boat. A floating stage capsizes from the weight of the panicking guests, pulling a electric wire which mutilates few tourists. Almost everyone in the lake is either wounded or killed by the piranhas or panicking guests that were recklessly driving their speed boats. Meanwhile, Jake spots Laura and Zane on the island, and forces Derrick to rescue them. Derrick crashes the boat into some rocks, flooding the rooms below deck. Kelly is trapped in the kitchen while Derrick, Crystal and Drew fall overboard due to the impact of the collision. Crystal is devoured and Drew disappears, leaving his fate unknown. Meanwhile, Danni manages to get a partially eaten Derrick back on board. Deputy Fallon makes a last stand, taking a boat motor and using its propellor to shred and kill many piranhas. After the chaos settles, Julie receives a call from Jake pleading for help. Julie and Novak steal a speed boat and head off towards the kids. Julie and Novak reach Jake and attach a rope to his boat. Julie, Danni, Laura, and Zane start crossing the rope, but the piranhas latch onto Danni's hair and ultimately devour her. The others make it to safety, but the rope comes loose. Using Derrick's corpse as a distraction, Jake ties the line to himself and goes to save Kelly. He ties Kelly to him and lights a flare after releasing the gas in a pair of stored propane tanks. Novak starts the boat and speeds away just as the piranhas surround Kelly and Jake. They are dragged to safety and the propane tanks explode, destroying the boat and killing most of the piranhas. Mr. Goodman calls Julie on the radio, and Julie tells him that they seem to have killed the majority of the piranhas. Terrified, Goodman tells her that the reproductive glands on the piranha they obtained were not mature, which means that the fish they were fighting were only the babies. As Novak wonders aloud where the parents are, a human sized piranha leaps out and knocks him into the water.

Brenner and his partner, ex-mercenary Charlton, employ Robin Wesley, a father who's still grieving over his dead heroin addict son, to destroy opium factories in the Golden Triangle. Wesley's team consists of other mercenaries from around the world, some who have been on the wrong side of the law . As the team enters the Golden Triangle by boat, while Fletcher, Brenner and Charlton remain in Hong Kong waiting on every piece of news transmitted from their base. After travelling a distance down river, the team disembark for a march through the jungle, where they meet up with Kim and his guerrilla fighters. Kim and his men guide Wesley's team through the jungle to a remote base located in a quarry, one of Kim's men and Klein eliminate a sentry in a watch tower each. As Wesley, China, Klein, Stone and Kim and his men prepare to descend the steep incline into the quarry, Arbib and Kowalski rig a rope slide across the top of the quarry. Kowalski firstly slides over the communications hut before dropping through the bamboo roof, killing one soldier and capturing the other even though he's been impaled through his upper left arm by a foot long piece of bamboo. Then Arbib drops into the sleeping quarters hut, there he's forced to kill all the occupants who are awakened and try to attack him. The rest of the commandos descend the steep quarry sides and shoot any enemy that escape Kowalski and Arbib, except for China who secures the bases lone helicopter and readies it for flight. With the base secured, Kim removes the bamboo splinter from Kowalski's arm and bandages it while Wesley uses the base's radio to inform his own base that they have captured the helicopter intact. Leaving Kowalski with two of Kim's men to guard the base and its radio, the rest join China aboard the helicopter before China takes off and heads deeper into the triangle. While Brenner and Charlton are enjoying a round of golf, Fletcher interrupts them to let them know that Wesley had neutralized the quarry base and captured the helicopter. As China pilots the helicopter towards the opium manufacturing depot, the depot radios the quarry to see if the radar contact they have is the quarry's helicopter. The lone survivor at the quarry confirms it is and is just on a routine trip, under the watchful eye and gun of Kowalski. Satisfied, the depot allows the helicopter to land and the commandos shoot their way out of the helicopter, killing all the enemy soldiers that stray into their sight. As Wesley, Arbib and Stone destroy heroin laboratories with C4, Klein blows the opium container silos with grenades and C4. While the destruction is happening, Stone is unfortunately wounded and Klein and Chine race to help him and Kim and his men locate prisoners and free them. All return to their homes except for a North American woman who behaves in a bizarre manner. China intervenes when he misjudges Kim to be attacking the woman, only for Arbib to point out that the woman is a heroin addict with puncture marks on her forearm. Wesley enters an office and rifles through a safe, when he finds a computer disk, which he loads on a nearby computer and browses its contents. The story follows the much the same as The Wild Geese; as the survivors get fewer and fewer, it is left to Wesley to act out his revenge.

A year ago, McKenzie watched his wife and son die in a car crash caused by a drunk driver attempting to flee the police. With his friend, General Joe Brodsky , McKenzie attends an auction of Wild West memorabilia, where they agree to bid on a pair of steamer trunks and split the contents between them. As the auction is conducted, flashbacks show the items' histories in the 19th century. At the time a man, Joseph Cole , is looking for a gunslinger who has a pair of distinctive ebony-handled pistols marked with stars. Some cowboys he encounters on the road point him towards the town of Crossfire, California. At the town saloon, he inquires about the man but is harassed by a trio of local thugs, one of whom shoots at him, hitting instead one of the trunks which Dr. McKenzie is bidding on in the present. Cole quickly shoots all three men dead, an event memorialized by a local photographer. In the present, McKenzie and Brodsky win the trunks at auction and McKenzie begins sorting through the contents, noticing the picture of the men who Cole killed. Under photo enhancement, McKenzie notices Cole in the background of the picture and identifies the gun Cole is carrying as a .357 Magnum from the 1980s. Despite this, chemical and spectroscopic testing indicates that the photograph is at least 100 years old. McKenzie becomes convinced that Cole is a time traveler. After writing up his findings, he is approached by a woman, Georgia Crawford , who claims to be working on similar ideas. Together they locate Crossfire in the present. When they split up to search the town, Georgia ducks into an old barn and removes a crystalline device which she uses to travel back to the 1880s. There she searches for Cole at a nearby river, but her horse is spooked by a rattlesnake. She dispatches the snake with a futuristic gun. Hurrying back to town, she is followed by Cole, who had observed her from afar. He arrives too late to stop her from traveling to the present, but he uses a device of his own to find out the time to which she traveled. In the present, McKenzie hears a noise and arrives at the barn just in time to see Georgia return from the past. When he confronts her, she admits to being one of a number of time travelers from the 26th century. Returning to McKenzie's home she explains that Cole is a renegade scientist from her time who she has been sent back to stop. She believes that Cole, who developed the time travel technology with her father, is intending to change history. Through research, Georgia and McKenzie determine that Cole is likely trying to kill Matthew Crawford, an adviser to President Grover Cleveland. The gunfighter who Cole is searching for, the mysterious ""Star-Handled Stranger,"" was a gunslinger who crucially helped protect the President and his escort from bandits. Matthew Crawford was Georgia's ancestor and killing him would erase her entire family from history, including her father who had opposed Cole's desire to continue research on time travel. McKenzie and Georgia enlist Joe Brodsky's help in determining President Cleveland's movements, but before Brodsky can give them the information, Cole murders him and flees into the past. Finding a copy of the information, they discover that Cole is traveling back to July 11, 1886, when the mysterious ""Star-Handled Stranger"" helped save President Cleveland from a bandit attack. Traveling back in time to 1886, Georgia and McKenzie watch as the attack begins. When the Stranger arrives on the scene and tries to enter the attack, he is shot dead by Cole. McKenzie then takes the Stranger's signature pistols and rides towards the battle himself. Cole follows him. While McKenzie manages to kill the attacking bandits, Cole shoots Matthew Crawford. McKenzie then kills Cole in a one-on-one duel. Returning to the stagecoach, Georgia and McKenzie discover that Matthew Crawford was merely wounded. As the stagecoach drives off, Georgia and McKenzie return to the present where Georgia gives him a gift before returning to her own time. She is somehow able to send the knowledge of the death of McKenzie's wife and child back to his earlier self so that he is able to save their lives."

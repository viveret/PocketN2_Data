Meanwhile, a Semester at Sea ship, called the Sea King, led by Professor Franklin Babish and his wife, Anne hits a dead shark, which becomes lodged in the boat’s propeller and damages the ship's hull, causing the boat to take on water. Soon after, the two-headed shark attacks the boat and breaks the radio antenna, preventing ship co-captain Laura from summoning help. The group then notices a deserted atoll nearby, so Laura drives the Sea King closer, before Professor Babish takes the students, consisting of Kate, Paul, Liza, Cole, Lyndsey, Ethan, Jamie, Ryan, Kirsten, Alex, Kristen, Kirk, Haley, Jeff, Alison, and Dana, over to the atoll on a dinghy, while Anne remains on the Sea King with Laura and the ship's crew, Han and Dikilla. As Professor Babish and the students explore the atoll, Laura enters the water to repair the ship's hull, but is quickly ripped apart by the shark. Meanwhile, the group searches the atoll for scrap metal to help repair the boat, where Kate tells Kirsten she is afraid of water. Kirk, Haley and Alison decide to go skinny dipping, only to be attacked and eaten by the two-headed shark. The rest of the group meet up and find two small speedboats before an apparent earthquake hits, causing Professor Babish to fall and badly cut his leg. Jeff and Mike take Professor Babish back to the Sea King on the dinghy and Anne tends to her husband while Jeff and Mike head back to the atoll, and discover Laura's severed hand in the water before the two-headed shark bites off Jeff's right arm. They attempt to swim back to the Sea King, but both are ultimately killed. Kate and Paul manage to fix the two boats they found, while Cole finds a gasoline tank to fuel them; he then jumps in one of the boats with Ryan, Jamie and Alex and drives away, prompting Kate, Paul, and Dana to follow in the other. The two boats race each other, unaware of Professor Babish's and Anne's warnings of the two-headed shark. The two-headed shark attacks Cole's boat, causing Ryan to fall into the water, where he is devoured, notifying the other students of the shark. Paul realizes the shark will continue to chase Cole's boat as it has a bigger engine. Cole also realizes this and jumps off the boat, leaving Jamie and Alex to be eaten. When they all reach shore, Kate furiously confronts Cole for letting Jamie and Alex die and a few minutes later, Anne, Proffesor Babish, and the crew arrive at the island, leaving the Sea King. Shortly afterward, another earthquake hits and the group begins to suspect that that the supposed earthquakes are actually the atoll collapsing in on itself from the underground. Now that it is more urgent to escape, the group creates a plan in which they hook up a generator to metal poles and place them in the water to distract the shark while Kate and Cole travel to the Sea King and repair the hull. The plan works until the two-headed shark attacks the poles, knocking Han and Dikilla into the water where they are eaten, before the two-headed shark swims to the Sea King. Kate fixes the Sea King, only for Cole to drive away without her, forcing her to swim back to the atoll. The two-headed shark attacks the Sea King, causing it to sink and send out a distress signal, and eats Cole, whose cell phone's ringing attracted its attention, while he attempts to escape on a lifeboat. As the group panics, the atoll begins to rapidly sink, prompting everyone to flee for their lives, but Kristen and Dana become separated from the group and are devoured when they go onto a dock. At the same time, Professor Babish and Anne spot a small tsunami coming and are eaten as well after they realize that they cannot escape. The tsunami hits and the atoll sinks, leaving the survivors with very little land. They take shelter in the still standing chapel, but the shark breaks in and devours Lyndsey, Michelle, Liza, and Ethan. Kate, Paul, and Kirsten escape the chapel and discover the gasoline tank and lure the shark towards it. Kate attempts to stab the two-headed shark, but Kirsten takes the tank, attracts its attention, and attempts to blow it up with her lighter as it begins chewing her up, but only one of its heads get blown off. Kate and Paul find one of the boats, and turn it on and jump off, before taking shelter on part of the remaining atoll.

The hills continue to change hands, so that even the ceasefire negotiators don't always know who controls them. Amidst the fighting, the South Korean officer commanding Alligator Company, who are fighting for Aerok Hill, is found dead by a Southern bullet. First Lieutenant Kang Eun-pyo of the Defense Security Command is sent to investigate the murder and also an apparent mole who had mailed a letter from a Northern solder to his family in the South. Eun-pyo arrives at the front lines accompanied with Captain Jae-oh, the new commanding officer of Alligator Company, and a raw recruit. Eun-pyo's perceptions change quickly upon arriving at the eastern front. The acting commander, Captain Young-il, is addicted to morphine, some of the men are wearing Northern uniforms to keep warm and refer to their fallen friends as ""comrades"", war orphans live among the soldiers, and Eun-pyo's old friend Kim Soo-hyeok is not only alive but has moved up in rank. He has also transformed from a scared and useless soldier to a ruthless killer and tactician. Also, the entire unit seems to be attempting to suppress their memories about something unspoken that happened in Pohang, earlier in the war. It turns out that Jung-yoon is commanding the North Korean forces against them, and after the North has again retaken the hill, the South take it back and Eun-pyo joins them in battle. When the fighting is finished he sees that the new recruit is drunk. As alcohol was not distributed to troops, his suspicion leads him to discover Soo-hyeok, Young-il, and a few other soldiers enjoying the contents of a secret communication box buried within the hills in a cave that acts as a mail system and gift exchange from one side to the other. It had originally been used to trade insults between the sides, but evolved into exchanging letters and presents. The North would leave rice wine, and the South would leave American made cigarettes and chocolate. Winter turns to summer and the land continues to change sides. Secrets are held not only by Soo-hyeok but among the seasoned fighters on both sides. Near the end of the war, Chinese troops are deployed in human wave tactics to attack the hill, and the North Koreans are positioned to cut off the retreat route of the South Koreans. During the battle, Jae-oh errs by committing his men to the front line despite the pleas of his lieutenants to fall back to a more defensible position. Eventually, the hill is overrun, and Jae-oh is murdered by Soo-hyeok after refusing to retreat. Soo-hyeok in turn is killed by a North Korean sniper nicknamed 'Two Seconds'. After the battle, news of an armistice agreement reaches both sides, and celebrations start. A group of North and South Korean soldiers encounter each other washing up in a mountain valley stream, but after a tense early moment, send each other off with goodbyes. However, the armistice is not yet in effect for another 12 hours. Both sides are told by their superiors to fight for the most strategically important pieces of land. As a result, there is a final climactic battle in which Eun-pyo kills 'Two Seconds', who turns out to be a woman. Captain Young-il's arm and leg are blown off by an explosion and then is shot and killed by Jung-yoon. Eventually, everyone on both sides is killed except for the North Korean commander Jung-yoon and Eun-pyo. Eun-pyo finds Jung-yoon in the cave with the gift box. He asks him why exactly they are fighting. Jung-yoon replies that he knew once, but has now forgotten. They share a smoke, and Jung-yoon dies shortly after. The movie ends with a shot of Eun-pyo walking down the hill among the corpses of all the fallen soldiers, leaving the fate of Aerok Hill unknown."

After the art session, Toola-Roola said to her friends to put some placecards with their cutie marks on them so they can tell whose plate is whom as they leave and wait for the paint to dry. However, the wind blows the cards onto the floor and Toola-Roola can't figure out which plate belongs to which pony. Pinkie Pie comes in and sees the mess, and as Toola puts the placecards back to their respective plates with Pinkie's help, everyone comes back to see the plates so they can start the party, only they find out that the plates got mixed up. In the end, Toola-Roola learns to be more responsible next time and the ponies finally got to enjoy the cake, and their plates.  Cheerilee, Starsong, Rainbow Dash and Toola Roola are outside, doodling and thinking something about their dream cake for Sweetie Belle's party. As Pinkie Pie and Scootaloo greets them, they both learned about the cakes they're gonna bake and decided to join them, also telling them to show the designs to Sweetie Belle. At Sweetie Belle's house, she is having a hard time researching on her ideal cake until her friends show her their cake designs. However, everyone then goes to bake their own dream cake, with Sweetie Belle telling to them to follow some instructions, which they don't. After the cake is finally baked and taken out of the oven, Sweetie Belle takes a taste test on their cake, only finding out it wasn't done well and the taste isn't what they imagined. The ponies apologized to Sweetie Belle and they all agree to do another cake, this time following instructions on baking and decorating. In the end, they all learn that they need to follow instructions next time and as everyone is full and can't eat their cake, they still had fun making them.

However, not everyone is happy for them as Elvira’s father  enters and angrily confronts Giovanni over his arrogance, adultery, and recklessness. Giovanni’s ego is unruffled by this and calmly tells his father-in-law to die as soon as possible. Elvira suggests Giovanni leave and get some champagne from the cellar. Giovanni takes the opportunity not only to get the champagne but also to have a sexual encounter with his wife’s sister. The father-in-law witnesses this act and attempts to kill him with an axe. However, Giovanni triumphs and slays his father-in-law instead. Surviving this, Giovanni furiously shouts towards the night sky that he is his own king, master, faith and god. On the road and on the run along a desert highway, Giovanni, with a camera attached to the front of his motorcycle, heads towards the ocean. A mysterious black Cadillac that appears to have no driver stalks him. On the way, Giovanni picks up a beautiful waitress named Julie who is headed to a nearby town for work. They stop at an enclosed body of water where Julie swims while Giovanni takes the opportunity to seduce a beautiful farm girl called Charlotte, after he chases off her immature and cowardly fiancé Pedro. Giovanni and Julie take off again with the mysterious black car not too far behind. The next day at a ramshackle bar Elvira’s brothers, Charles and Alphonse, have a slight argument while on the trail of Giovanni. After Charles leaves briefly, Alphonse is about to be murdered by a gang of biker thugs for kicks. However, Giovanni suddenly appears and rescues his ex-brother-in-law. Together, they fight and disable the entire gang. For this, Alphonse lets Giovanni escape to continue the pursuit to the dismay of Charles. Later that night Giovanni almost seduces Julie with his philosophy and dreamy eyes, when they are chased half-naked up a tree by the mysterious black Cadillac. The car then drives off and the two remain in the tree for the night. The next morning Giovanni is bitten by a snake. Julie tries to get help by pulling into a nearby gas station. In this movie’s oddest scene, Julie pleads to the mute garage workers that she needs help, but instead she is cornered by three men who begin to wash her with sponges. Suddenly, in walks the sheriff who claims that the men are not dangerous but only miss their younger sister. The sheriff and Julie get Giovanni to the hospital where he is shown fending off death in mixture of flashbacks and peculiar images. On the road again, Julie and Giovanni come across a homeless man in the desert after Julie falls off the motorcycle. When the man asks for some change, Giovanni promises to hand over a large sum of money to him if he will swear there is no god. The homeless man declines and Giovanni gives him the money anyway. Later that night, Giovanni with Julie follow a happy couple to a small desert inn. Giovanni invites them to drinks and soon seduces the bride-to-be in front of choreographed dancers in a bar. After a brawl with her fiancé, Giovanni and the woman have sex somewhere in the desert. The next morning a man demands to meet with Giovanni; this man wants Giovanni to repay the money he loaned him. However, this is averted when Giovanni hastily spins the conversation and the man’s reasons for being there. Later, he is seen having a phone conversation with his ex-wife in which he falsely professes to be a changed man following god. He and Julie argue over his hypocrisy, duplicitous values, and motivations to live a false life and she departs. Later, clearly upset and drunk, Giovanni puts his head under the wheel of the black Cadillac that has been following them and falls asleep. Elvira’s brothers, Charles and Alphonse, appear from the darkness waking Giovanni. They give Giovanni the chance to redeem himself and return to their sister, which he refuses. Instead, he says they will have their face-off tomorrow. However, before this occurs, Giovanni and Julie have sex when she is finally willing to be seduced. The next morning he leaves without saying goodbye. On the road, Giovanni and the black Cadillac attempt to outmaneuver each other. The scene ends with Giovanni and his motorcycle approaching near collision with a tractor-trailer. It is assumed that Giovanni is dead with his motorcycle clearly crushed beneath the tractor-trailer and emergency personnel all about. However, in this film’s final scene, Giovanni emerges from the black car that has been following him throughout the entire movie. He is in front of a church wearing the attire of a priest and a devious smile.

Unwilling to let her daughter travel alone, Amy  also disembarks the plane, only to discover that the next flight to Palm Springs departs after Christmas. Meanwhile, the rest of the family arrives in Palm Springs, but things aren’t any easier as Bob  tries to care for Charlie  under the watchful eye of Amy’s mother Petunia , who strongly dislikes Bob; PJ  learns the pros and cons of his grandparents’ pool after getting a sunburn; and Gabe  quickly realizes the downfalls of teaching Grandpa Hank  how to play his favorite video game after Grandpa becomes addicted to it. Stranded and in desperation, Teddy and Amy find unconventional ways to get to Palm Springs before Christmas, while keeping in contact with Bob via cellphone. On their journey, Amy reveals that she is pregnant again when they hitch hike with two strangers who turn out to be part of an alien abduction survivors network. When the two arrive in Las Vegas, they get into an argument, where Amy promptly blames Teddy for them getting them lost in the first place; they later make up. Hungry, they sing and perform Christmas carols to get money for food, arguing and making people laugh, as someone has stolen their luggage. Amy then wants to turn their arguments into a Broadway Musical. Later, they find the girl named Jordan who had stolen their luggage and confront her. She apologizes for stealing it, breaking down in tears and explaining her situation. Teddy then gives her free plane ticket to Jordan, saying that she doesn't mind losing it if it means getting Jordan home to her family for Christmas. This gesture helps Teddy and Amy bond from their previous arguments, and shows Amy that Teddy is responsible. PJ, Bob, and Gabe travel to Las Vegas to get Amy and Teddy, but are mistakenly kidnapped on the way and participate in a paintball match based on Gabe's video game so that they can return to their car. Gabe wins the match by taking the ""Stone of Mitrios"", which he was already planning to do. In return, they get a free helicopter ride to save Teddy and Amy. Grandpa and Grandma then arrive with Charlie by car, and the entire family is finally reunited. Amy admits not only that they finally got the Christmas vacation they wanted, but also that this was the best Christmas they've ever had. She then reveals that she is having another baby, much to the happiness of the Duncans. In the epilogue, on the way back to Denver from their Christmas trip, Gabe attempts to take the ""Stone of Mitrios"" on the plane ride back, but it is taken away by a flight attendant. Another flight attendant then announces the offering of a free plane ticket, which Teddy quickly accepts once again. Amy says to Bob, ""Your turn"", as in it is his turn to go along with Teddy in leaving the plane. Bob obediently goes after Teddy, jokingly reminding Amy that they will be back by New Year's.

Soon a line of ants emerges from a nearby bush and marches past Donald, each carrying a grain harvested in the wild. Donald takes interest in the straggler, a small ant who seems to be carrying a bean several times his body weight. Donald begins to test the ant to see how much he can take. The ant, seemingly unaware of Donald, continues to march. Finally Donald balances several food items from his picnic on the any, which the ant carries. But when Donald makes the ant walk a tight rope, Donald plucks the string causing the ant to fall into a large custard pie. The ant is angry with Donald at first, but when he tastes the pie and sees all of Donald's food, he becomes elated. He enthusiastically runs back to the ant colony and tells the ants about all of Donald's food. The ants call the colony together using mushrooms as drums. Later, while Donald is sleeping against a tree next to his picnic basket, a small team of ants sneak up on him. The open the basket, but Donald, still asleep, instinctively puts his hand over the basket to keep the ants out. Then all of the ants fill in around Donald and pick him up. They carry him over to a cliff where they throw him off into the water. As an angry Donald races back up the cliff, the ants are carrying food items out of his basket into their hole. In a mock game of football Donald is steamrolled by the ants. As he tries grab his food directly from their hole, the ants pull of Donald's shirt as well. He then puts on a barrel to protect his modest, and shoves several sticks of dynamite down the anthill and ignites it. Immediately after the explosion, Donald laughs that he has seemingly had the last say against the ants. Yet moments later, the ground around Donald starts to crack. Donald is standing near the cliff, and the explosion of the dynamite causes a large part of the cliff to fall away, and Donald falls into the water a second time, screaming as he does. In the final sense, the ant colony congregates around a large cupcake. The little ant whom Donald had been harassing runs to the top and takes a big bite out of the cherry.

Here, he is seen wearing a shirt for the first time.{{cite web}} Also joining him in his adventure is a brown slender dog, running along. At a site not too faraway, a live girl teddy bear is keeping herself in shape by having her waist shuffled by a moving towel. The towel's ends are attached to the back of a shaky automobile. Meanwhile, her little brother hops on the car's front seat for a moment and jumps off, but accidentally moves a switch. As a result, the automobile was shaken too much for her liking, and she calls for help. Oswald picks up the distress call and comes to her aid. For some reason, Oswald fires his gun at the vehicle, stopping it completely. The teddy bear was relieved of her trouble and was most thankful. Oswald and the teddy bear befriended each other. As the rabbit greets her goodbye to carry on in his journey, the beautiful bruin asks him where he is heading. Oswald then tells he is on a hunting trip. Finding his activity interesting, the teddy bear requests him to get her a fox skin. Oswald agrees to her wish. Oswald and his dog set off in their horse to hunt for a fox. The fox in the area knows of their purpose, and therefore thinks of ways to keep them at bay. Minutes later, they were standing side-by-side, looking for their targeted animal. Without the two knowing, the fox comes up behind them and ties the dog's tail around the Oswald's leg. The fox then kicks Oswald in the rear, prompting the rabbit to send the dog into a chase.

He writes to her son, Ryan, who is in fact his own son, telling him he intends to return. After years of raising horses and living a solitary life, Blackthorn sets off for Potosí to sell his horses. He tells his lover, Yana , that he will see her again before leaving Bolivia. At Potosí, Blackthorn withdraws his savings from the bank, sells his horses, and then heads back to his village. Along the way, he is ambushed and nearly killed. He shoots his attacker, but not before Blackthorn's horse, Cinco, bolts off with his money. The shooter is Eduardo Apodaca , a Spaniard mining engineer who claims he was shooting at pursuers. He begs Blackthorn to save him, and offers to share part of the $50,000 he stole from Simón Patiño, a powerful Bolivian industrialist and mine owner. The money is hidden in an abandoned mine, and he will compensate Blackthorn for his help. Blackthorn and the Spaniard set out across the desert plateau with Patiño's posse within a day's pursuit. They reach the abandoned mine and find the money, but the posse catches up with them. Following a shootout, Blackthorn and the Spaniard escape with the money. They make their way to Blackthorn's cabin, where the famous outlaw remembers his old friendships with the Sundance Kid and Etta Place, and how they escaped from Pinkerton Detective Mackinley . Yana joins the men at the cabin, and Blackthorn gives her a pocket watch he won in a card game. At first she rejects it as a ""gringo machine"", but then accepts the gift as something to remember him by. Later, Yana returns to the cabin to stay with Blackthorn on his last night before leaving. The next morning, two female members of the posse come to the cabin looking for the Spaniard, and in the ensuing gunfight, Blackthorn is wounded, and Yana is killed. A heartbroken Blackthorn and the Spaniard leave with the rest of the posse not far behind. They set out across the Uyuni salt flats, hoping to reach the coast where Blackthorn can find a boat to take him home. Halfway across, the posse catches up to them, but Blackthorn and the Spaniard split up and are able to kill their pursuers and escape. When he reaches Tupiza, Blackthorn is treated by a doctor, who notifies former Pinkerton Detective Mackinley—now living a quiet life in Bolivia—of his famous patient. Mackinley confirms the man's identity. For years Mackinley claimed that the two bandits killed at San Vincente were not Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and now he will finally be proven correct. But after initially notifying the Bolivian army of the discovered outlaw, Mackinley changes his mind, returns Blackthorn's pistol, and helps him escape. When Mackinley later discovers that Blackthorn was involved with the Spaniard, he reveals the truth to him about the Spaniard and his pursuers. Apparently, the $50,000 the Spaniard stole was not from the powerful mine owner, Patiño, but from the mining families who recently took control of the mines. The Spaniard stole the money from ""the people""—something Butch Cassidy would never have done. Although disgusted with Blackthorn's involvement, he does not betray him.

During his farewell dinner he becomes drunk and winds up getting married at a marriage shop to Tilly Farmfield, ""a young woman of doubtful character"". After the ceremony, his friend Bob Lambert rescues Dick from Tilly as they arrive at the Night Birds' Club. The next day Dick heads out to Waroonga, ignorant of the fact he is married.

Roxana has been sold to Omar Id-Din, who could be plotting against the sultan. Starbuck challenges Omar to a duel, with the winner acquiring the other's rifle and slave. Starbuck wins and intends to return home with Roxana, but they are betrayed by the jealous Lilith, who fights Roxana and tells Omar of their plans. Starbuck is taken prisoner. Lilith has a change of heart, however, and changes clothes with Roxana to fool the guards.

CIA specialist Tony Mendez , brought in for consultation, points out the fundamental weaknesses in all of the proposals for how to do so, but is at a loss to suggest an alternative until he gets an idea while watching Battle for the Planet of the Apes on TV with his son: create a cover story that the escapees are Canadian filmmakers, scouting ""exotic"" locations in Iran for a similar film. Mendez and his supervisor Jack O'Donnell  contact John Chambers , a Hollywood make-up artist who has previously crafted disguises for the CIA in addition to his work in the Apes film series. Chambers puts them in touch with film producer Lester Siegel . Together they set up a phoney film studio and successfully establish the pretense of developing Argo, a ""science fantasy"" in the style of Star Wars, to lend credibility to the cover story. Meanwhile, the escapees grow frantic inside the ambassador's residence. Shredded documentation from the US embassy is being reassembled, providing the revolutionaries with evidence that there are embassy personnel unaccounted for. Posing as a producer for Argo, Mendez enters Iran and links up with the six escapees, providing them with Canadian passports and extensive information about their fake identities to help them convincingly bluff their way through security at the airport. Although they are afraid to trust Mendez's scheme, they reluctantly agree to go along with it, knowing that Mendez is risking his own life too, and convinced that it is their only option. A ""scouting"" visit to the bazaar to maintain their cover story takes a bad turn, but Mendez gets them away from the hostile crowd. Mendez is informed that the operation has been cancelled, to avoid conflicting with a planned military rescue of the hostages. He pushes ahead nevertheless, forcing O'Donnell to hastily demand of his superiors to reactivate logistical support. At the airport there is tension as the escapees' flight reservations are only confirmed at the last minute and a call to the supposed studio in Hollywood at first goes unanswered. The group boards the plane, just as the revolutionaries uncover the ruse and hastily attempt to stop them. To protect the hostages remaining in Tehran from further retaliation, all US involvement in the caper is suppressed, giving full credit to the Canadian government and its ambassador . Mendez is awarded the Intelligence Star, but due to the classified nature of the mission, he would not be able to keep the medal until the details were made public in 1997. All the hostages are later freed on January 20, 1981. The film ends with Jimmy Carter giving a speech about the Crisis and the Canadian Caper, with screenshots from the film being contrasted with images of the actual people and events during the crisis."

Her shy daughter, Ethel , works in a lightbulb factory, and son, Sid , tailors men's suits. Her husband, Stanley ([[Phil Davis , is a car mechanic. Although Vera and her family are poor, their strong family bonds hold them together, and we see Vera's constant small acts of kindness to the many people she encounters throughout her day. Vera works as a house cleaner. However, unbeknownst to her family, she also serves as a backroom abortionist. She receives no money for this, believing her help to be an act of charity. However, Lily , who also carries on a black-market trade in scarce postwar foodstuffs, charges two guineas  for arranging the abortions, without Vera's knowledge. The film also contains a subplot about an upper class young woman, Susan , the daughter of one of Vera's employers. Susan is raped by a suitor, becomes pregnant, and asks a friend to put her in contact with a doctor, through whom she can obtain an abortion. The doctor first refers her to a psychiatrist, who prompts her to answer questions in a certain way, so that he can recommend an abortion on legal grounds: that she has a family history of mental illness and that she may commit suicide if not allowed to terminate the pregnancy. The abortion costs her a hundred guineas. After one of her patients nearly dies, Vera is arrested by the police and taken into custody for questioning. She is held overnight and appears before a magistrate the next morning. Sid is shocked by his mother's secret activities and tells his father that he does not think that he can forgive her. Vera is bailed to appear at the Old Bailey. None of Vera's employers will give her a character reference. Her solicitor thinks she will receive the minimum sentence of 18 months in jail; the judge sentences her to two and a half years imprisonment 'as a deterrent to others'. This affects all the people who previously depended on Vera's kindness.

Joe's newest weapon, the Broadcast Energy Transmitter , a device that, when activated, sends out surges of electrical power. Cobra assaults the Joes as they test the BET in the Himalayas. The Joes use the BET to activate their automated weapons systems and defeat the Cobra forces. Serpentor is captured and Cobra Commander orders a retreat. Cobra Commander leads his troops into the mountains, promising them a safe haven. A small detachment of G.I. Joe forces follow them. As the Joes celebrate their victory, a new group of rookie Joes are brought onto the team, including the allegedly clumsy kunoichi Jinx, military police officer Law and his dog Order, former basketball player Big Lob, EOD specialist Tunnel Rat, undercover officer Chuckles, and the rebellious slacker and half-brother to Duke, the green beret Lieutenant Falcon. Falcon and Duke dislike each other due to Falcon's immaturity and irresponsibility. Pursued by a cadre of G.I. Joe troops, Cobra Commander leads his forces to Cobra-La. An army of insect-armor wearing soldiers attack the Joe forces and imprison them within the Lovecraftian living environment of Cobra-La. The Cobra soldiers are met by Cobra-La's leader Golobulus. Golobulus orders Cobra Commander arrested as the rest of the group learns the secret origin of both Cobra-La and Cobra: Cobra-La was an ancient civilization that ruled the Earth, in part due to their advanced scientific knowledge that allowed them to manipulate and convert living creatures into advanced bio-organic technology. Their society was devastated by the onset of the Ice Age, forcing the survivors into caverns within the Himalayan mountains. As centuries passed, Cobra-La rebuilt their society in secret. Golobulus, hating humanity due to their polluting technology and ecologically unfriendly ways, vowed to wipe them off the face of the Earth, and found an agent in the form of a former nobleman who was working on biological weapons of mass destruction. A lab accident caused the nobleman's face to be permanently disfigured with eight additional eyes. Equipping him with a featureless silver facemask that allowed his multiple eyes to work normally, as well as a uniform that allowed him to pass for human, the nobleman became Cobra Commander and was charged with conquering the world for Cobra-La. However, Cobra Commander's repeated failures led Golobulus to arrange for Serpentor's creation, by implanting the inspiration to create Serpentor into Doctor Mindbender's brain with a small creature called a ""psychic motivator"". Golobulus punishes Cobra Commander for his repeated failures, exposing him to the biological weapon Cobra Commander disfigured himself developing years earlier: mutative spores that slowly transform Cobra Commander into a large snake. He escapes and makes his way to the Joes' camp with Roadblock, blinded in hand-to-hand combat with Golobulus' huge henchman, the Nemesis Enforcer. Zarana is sent to the Joes' main base in disguise, where she seduces Lt. Falcon into letting her view Serpentor's holding cell. Duke catches him in the act and having abandoned his training. Duke ends up putting Lt. Falcon on guard duty until he says otherwise. After Falcon abandons his post to flirt with Jinx later that night, the Dreadnoks free Serpentor with the aid of the Nemesis Enforcer. Lt. Falcon is scolded by General Hawk for abandoning his post which led to some of the G.I. Joe members being hospitalized. General Hawk ends up condemning Lt. Falcon to his quarters until court-martial. With Serpentor freed, Golobulus orders the rest of Cobra to aid him in his scheme to destroy humanity. Golobulus intends to launch mutagenic spore pods into orbit and use the BET to hatch the spores, mutating all of humanity into mindless animals to be controlled by Cobra-La. General Hawk is convinced by Duke to spare Lt. Falcon a harsh punishment. The other generals reassign Lt. Falcon to the ""Slaughter House"" where he is to be whipped back into shape by Sergeant Slaughter and his ""Renegades"" consisting of ex-Viper Mercer, former football player Red Dog, and former acrobat Taurus. While on a recon mission to the Terrordome , Slaughter and his crew learn of Cobra's plans. The Joes mobilize to protect the BET, leaving Falcon and the new recruits behind. When Cobra attacks, the recruits take it upon themselves to help the Joes. Cobra mounts a large offensive and steals the BET device. Serpentor nearly kills Falcon, but he is saved by Duke at the last moment. Taking the attack meant for Falcon, Duke falls into a coma. Falcon, the Renegades and the new recruits head to the Himalayas to stop Cobra-La. The G.I. Joe team is led to Cobra-La's lair by Cobra Commander, who loses his mental faculties as he mutates. The new recruits prove themselves as valuable soldiers as the Joes rescue their captured teammates and foil Golobulus's plans as he gets away. Old scores are settled as Jinx defeats Pythona, Sgt. Slaughter battles and defeats the Nemesis Enforcer and Falcon causes Serpentor to lose control of his air chariot and is sent hurtling out of Cobra-La. Together, Slaughter and Jinx enable Falcon to reconfigure the BET to incinerate the spore pods in space, destroying them. The machine overloads, destroying Cobra-La. As the Joes celebrate their victory, Doc announces that Duke has come out of his coma.
4028951Chicago college student Max Hanson  is a talented artist and hockey player. Though more interested in the latter, he is under pressure from his mother, Sophie  to pursue a career in art, influenced by the fact that she put her own career aside to raise the family and has just landed a coveted position with a local art gallery. Max's father, Ed , is a tax attorney with a more laid-back approach to his son's future, just wanting him to be happy. While working at the local video store with best friends Orin  and Kate , a cute girl comes in with her friends seeking a copy of Arachnophobia, and Max is immediately smitten. After locating her on campus the next day, she introduces herself as Molly White , who already knows Max's name from his hockey jersey. She then gives Max her phone number and invites him to a party she's attending that night. Before long, Max and Molly are becoming an item, the two even managing to make love in his bedroom with his mother and younger sister Chloe in the house. However, Max soon finds out that Molly is a drug addict, as he accompanies her on a trek to score some heroin, which she promptly snorts. Max invites Molly to Chloe's birthday party, and though she initially refuses to attend because it's the same night as a Smashing Pumpkins concert, she later relents. However, a minor argument erupts between her and Sophie, resulting in Molly leaving abruptly and putting the brakes on their budding relationship. Devastated, Max does his best to move on, but has a hard time doing so. Finally, he's taken to a party one night by Orin and Kate, where he promptly spots Molly. She asks if they can go somewhere and talk; he accepts, she apologizes, and the two make up. The next day, Max visits Sophie at work and tries to express his feelings about Molly, but her response is less than positive. A short time later, Molly celebrates their new-found relationship by having them shoot up together in her apartment, and Max soon becomes hooked, neglecting his studies and job. Soon thereafter, Molly learns that she's three months behind on rent, and has a week to pay before being evicted. Not having enough money in his bank account to pay it, Max goes to the video store to get his paycheck, but having only worked two hours during the past week, that's all the pay he receives, and he is also given a pink slip. Sensing his friend may be in over his head, Orin offers to try to help Max, but all he wants is money to supposedly ""fix the car"" . After returning home, Max takes $200 from Ed's wallet; when he gently attempts to approach the subject with his son, even offering to help him out of his financial situation, an argument erupts that culminates in Sophie striking Max. Feeling as though he can never go back home, Max and Molly  move in with her druggie friends. Not long after, Max shows up at the ice rink attempting to steal money from Orin in the locker room, but is caught in the act . Once back at the pad, Max catches Molly having sex with a man in exchange for drugs, and physically confronts him. Later, as their financial situation worsens, the couple is reduced to panhandling at the local mall, where Sophie spots Max, but says nothing until a few days later. After hearing this news, Ed and his other son Brian attempt to find Max, but are unsuccessful. His addiction now totally out of control, Max tries to rob a local comic book store for drug money, but is caught by the police. Ed and Brian later bail Max out, and while Brian thinks he needs to be put into rehab, Ed insists he can take care of Max at home. However, the effects of withdrawal are in full swing, and it proves to be an uphill battle. Finally, after going into a rage, Max becomes unconscious and is taken to a hospital. Once there, an arguments erupts between Ed and Sophie, with Sophie insisting that she did what anyone else would have done, but Ed retorts ""that's a bunch of crap"" and reminds her that neither he nor the kids made her stop painting; she did it all by herself, and that in her self-absorbed attitude, she failed to notice that all Max wanted was ""to know it was OK to not be perfect"". The next day, a doctor informs the family that Max needs to get into a treatment program, but stresses the difficulty of doing so. However, while this discussion takes place, Max manages to slip out of the hospital and begins frantically searching for Molly, finally finding her in a sleazy motel room where she has died of a heroin overdose. Out of his mind with grief, Max shows up at Kate's apartment and begs her for money; when she refuses, he accuses her of ""wanting"" him and offers to prostitute himself. Enraged, Kate throws Max out of the apartment, but in his stupor, he takes a tumble down the stairwell. The following morning, after his family had searched unsuccessfully for him, Max is brought home in a taxi, Kate by his side. Informing his mother of Molly's death, the two tearfully embrace, and as he prepares to leave for his month-long stay in rehab, he and Sophie finally reach an understanding. Sophie admits that she never saw Max for who he was and encourages him to be whatever he wants, telling Max that she loves him as the two embrace again. The film ends with Max saying goodbye to Brian and Chloe as he departs for rehab, before he and Ed drive away.
18974432When an electrical power failure occurs, Mrs. Hilyard, a wealthy widow recuperating from a broken hip, becomes trapped between floors in the cage-like elevator she has installed in her mansion. With her son Malcolm away for a summer weekend, she relies on the elevator's emergency alarm to attract attention, but the only response comes from an alcoholic derelict, George, who enters the home, ignores her pleas and steals some small items. The wino sells them to a fence, then visits his prostitute friend, Sade, and tells her of the treasure trove he has stumbled upon. The expensive goods George fenced attracts the attention of three young hoodlums, Randall, Elaine, and Essie. The trio follows George and Sade back to the Hilyard home, where they conduct an orgy of violence, killing George the wino and locking Sade in a closet. Randall then pulls himself up to the elevator and taunts Mrs. Hilyard with a note left behind by her son Malcolm, in which he threatens suicide because of her domineering manner. Shocked by the revelation, Mrs. Hilyard struggles with Randall, escapes the elevator, and crawls out of the house.

2330126 The film begins with Turaga Vakama  describing a land that existed before Mata Nui called Metru Nui. The residents of the great city believed that the warriors known as the Toa would protect them, but eventually they were all defeated, save for one named ""Lhikan"". Lhikan travels throughout the entire city, giving Toa stones to six Matoran: Whenua, Nuju, Matau, Onewa, Nokama, and Vakama. After giving the last stone to Vakama, Lhikan is captured by two Dark Hunters called Nidhiki  and Krekka. Vakama later meets the other Matoran at the Great Temple in Ga-Metru; there, they are transformed into six new Toa. After Vakama has a vision, they all set out to recover the six Great Disks hidden throughout Metru Nui, believing that it would prove to Turaga Dume  that they are worthy Toa. Upon retrieving the disks , the Toa bring the disks to the Coliseum. However, Dume issues that ""small gifts"" won't confirm them as Toa. He then tests them by starting a sea of rising metal in the Coliseum. When the six fail to cross it, and Dume denounces them as ""imposters"", he unleashes the Vahki  upon them. In the process, Onewa, Nuju, and Whenua are sucked into a massive vortex and imprisoned while Vakama and the others escape the Coliseum by leaping into a chute system. However, the Dark Hunters follow them and manage to get the flow of the chute reversed. The Toa escape, but are left dangling from a dangerous height. While swinging to a tower, Matau falls, but is saved when he discovers that his blades can grant him flight. When the Toa reach the ground, Vakama discovers that the Great Disks can be fused together. He then spots Lhikan’s ""spirit star"" soaring overhead; as long as it burns in the night sky, it means that Lhikan is still alive. They hitched a ride on a Vahki transport to follow the star. When they arrived in Po-Metru, they encountered the Dark Hunters once more. Just when a battle is about to ensue, a herd of beasts called Kikanalo stampeded through canyons. As the Toa were fleeing, Nokama discovered that her mask allowed her to speak and understand the language of the Kikanalo. After stopping the stampede, she spoke to the leader of the herd and learned that Lhikan was taken to the Canyon of Unending Whispers. They were then taken to a large canyon guarded by Vahki. They managed to bypass the Vahki and the Dark Hunters with the help of the Kikanalo and Matau's newly discovered mask power of illusion. While the previous events occurred, Onewa and Whenua were unsuccessfully trying to break out of prison. They then met a Turaga. He explained that mask powers are needed to escape, and how they could be found. He then had the Toa perform seemingly pointless tasks. Eventually, Onewa and Whenua got into a fight in which Onewa discovered that his mask power was mind-control. Nuju then discovered his mask power, Telekinesis, and created a way out. Whenua found his mask power, night-vision, and provided illumination in the tunnel with his mask. They were then reunited with the other three Toa. When they debated where Lhikan was, the Turaga removed his helmet and revealed that he was Lhikan. Vakama finds a small canister holding Dume and learned that the Dume from before was an impostor. A squadron of Vahki suddenly attacked and the group fled on a spare transport. Meanwhile, ""Dume"" had summoned the Matoran to the Coliseum to be placed in the spheres. By the time the Toa arrived, it was too late; all the Matoran were now asleep. The false Dume then removed his mask and revealed himself to be Makuta Teridax. He plunged the Great Spirit Mata Nui into slumber and began absorbing energy from the city. He then absorbed Nivawk, Krekka, and Nidhiki, thus killing them. Whenua located the Matoran , who were underneath the Coliseum and stored in canisters. After surveying them, they realized that only a few of the Matoran can been carried on the transport and the rest would have to wait. They gathered as many of the spheres as possible, and began their journey out. Along the way, Vakama begins carving the Mask of Time from the disk when all visions he had previously seen reappeared and he came to a revelation: Teridax wanted control of time. To save the Matoran, the Toa must ""follow the light"". But as they neared, Teridax, now an immense winged being, attacked. Vakama attempted to use the Mask of Time when he confronted the Makuta, but Teridax then launched an attack. Because the Mask of Time only slowed time, Vakama could not avoid it. Just then, Lhikan leaped in and took the blow. The Mask of Time was knocked off of Vakama, and Teridax flew after it. As Lhikan lay dying, he explained to Vakama the Toa's duty to the Matoran. He then gave Vakama his mask and died. Anguished, Vakama discovered his mask power: invisibility. Just as Teridax was about to use the Mask of Time, Vakama knocked it away, and the mask fell into the sea. Teridax, enraged, attempts to kill Vakama. After a deadly battle, Vakama managed to trick Teridax into grabbing a towering boulder which slammed him into a wall. The Toa gathered and, combining their powers, sealed Teridax in a protodermis prison. The Toa continued towards the light and arrived on the island of Mata Nui. When all the Matoran Spheres were placed on the beach of Mata Nui, the Toa discharged energy into the spheres, becoming Turaga in the process, and awakened the Matoran. One of the Matoran, Takua, led Vakama to a Matoran whose mask was shattered. Vakama gave this Matoran, Jaller, Lhikan's mask and its shape changed to become his. The film then ends with the other Matoran cheering while the symbol of the Three Virtues  appeared in the sky.

His method for reassessing his life is to narrate it to his class and interweave in it three generations of his family's history.

In 1794, in Marseille, Désirée Clary  makes the acquaintance of a Corsican named Joseph Bonaparte  and invites him and his brother, Gen. Napoleon Bonaparte , to call upon the family the following day. The next day, Julie , Désirée's sister and Joseph are immediately attracted to each other, and Napoleon is taken with Désirée. He admits to her that the poor Bonaparte brothers need the rich dowries of the Clary sisters. Later, Désirée learns that Napoleon has been arrested and taken to Paris. Napoleon eventually returns to Marseille, tells Désirée that he has been cleared of all charges, but has been ordered to track down royalists in Paris. Désirée begs Napoleon to leave the Army and join her brother in business, but he scoffs at the idea and instead proposes marriage. Désirée accepts and lends Napoleon the money to return to Paris.

Désirée, stunned by the news that she will one day be a queen, nevertheless supports her husband, and eventually Napoleon allows both of them to leave Paris. In Stockholm, Désirée does not fit in with the royal family and asks to go home. Eight months later, she attends a ball in Paris at which Napoleon shows off his new son. Napoleon makes veiled threats about Bernadotte’s alliance with Russia and announces to the crowd that she will be held hostage to ensure Sweden’s support while his army marches through Russia to Moscow. Napoleon’s army is defeated and he visits Désirée and asks her to write a letter to Bernadotte, requesting his help. Désirée realizes that Napoleon still loves her and came more for her than to seek her husband’s help. Soon after, Bernadotte leads one of the armies that overwhelms Napoleon, and the triumphant general reunites with Désirée before returning to Sweden. Napoleon’s exile to Elba is short-lived, however, and after the battle of Waterloo, Napoleon retreats with his personal army to the Château de Malmaison. Representatives of the allied armies ask Désirée to speak with Napoleon, hoping that she can persuade him to surrender. Napoleon agrees to speak with Désirée alone, and muses on what his destiny would have been if he had married her. Napoleon proclaims that he has given his life to protect France, but Désirée gently tells him that he must do as France asks and go into exile on St. Helena. Commenting on how strange it is that the two most outstanding men of their time had fallen in love with her, Napoleon gives Désirée his sword in surrender, and assures her that her dowry was not the only reason he proposed to her many years ago in Marseille.
842825 In 1957, a large alien robot crashes from orbit near the coast of Rockwell, Maine with no memory. Shortly after, the Iron Giant wanders off into the mainland. Nine-year-old Hogarth Hughes follows a trail of the forest's destruction and frees the robot, who is stuck in the power cables of an electrical substation. After being rescued by and befriended by Hogarth, the Giant follows him back to his house, where he lives with his mother Annie. Upon their return, the robot attempts to eat the iron off the nearby railroad tracks. Alarmed at the sound of an incoming train, Hogarth tells the giant to repair the tracks. The robot attempts this, but takes too long, causing the train to collide with his head. Hogarth hides the damaged robot in their barn where he discovers the robot is self repairing. Later that night, Hogarth returns to the barn with a stack of comic books to read to the Giant. The robot is impressed with Superman, but distressed when he discovers a comic about an evil robot; Hogarth tells the robot that it can be who he chooses to be. Investigating the destroyed substation, U.S. government agent Kent Mansley discovers evidence of the robot and decides to continue his inquiries in nearby Rockwell. Finding a BB gun Hogarth left near the substation the night he found the Giant, Mansley takes up a room for rent at Hogarth's home and trails the boy to learn more. Hogarth says to the robot to dive in the lake which it does, creating a tsunami that sweeps Dean onto the road. Mansley is paranoid about an alien invasion and alerts the U.S. Army to the possible presence of the robot. Worried that they will get caught, Hogarth evades Mansley and takes the robot to beatnik artist Dean McCoppin who passes off the robot as one of his works of art when Mansley and Lieutenant General Rogard investigate. Hogarth inadvertently activates a self-defense mechanism  in the giant with a toy gun, but Dean saves Hogarth. Commanding the robot to leave, they soon realize that the robot cannot control the SDM, and they chase after it before reaching town. In Rockwell, the robot saves two boys, but Mansley, having seen it, orders an attack to stop it. The robot flees with Hogarth until he is shot down by a missile, and after crash landing, the robot believes Hogarth to be dead, causing the enraged robot to activate its weapons and attack the Army, who are no match for the advanced firepower. Mansley lies to Rogard that the robot killed Hogarth, before telling him to lure the robot out to sea so they can destroy it with a nuclear ballistic missile from the USS Nautilus. Hogarth  wakes up and calms the robot down, causing it to deactivate its weapons. Dean tells Rogard and his men to stand down. Rogard, realizing that Mansley lied to him, is about to tell the Nautilus to stand down, but Mansley snatches the walkie-talkie and calls the Nautilus to launch the missile anyway. Realizing the deadly mistake, Rogard argues with Mansley and informs him that the robot, along with everybody in Rockwell will be destroyed when the missile falls. Mansley refuses to take note of the town's fate and tries to escape Rockwell in order to save himself, but the robot stops Mansley, who is then arrested by the Army. When Hogarth tells the robot about Rockwell's fate, the robot flies off to intercept the missile, as a hero, not a weapon. The robot and missile collide, causing a massive explosion high up in the atmosphere. The people of the town recognize the giant as a hero, but everyone, especially Hogarth is deeply saddened by the robot's sacrifice. Some time later, Annie and Dean have a romantic relationship and Dean creates a statue honoring the robot. Hogarth receives a package from Rogard, containing the only piece of the robot they found, a small jaw bolt. That night, Hogarth awakens to a familiar beeping coming from the bolt, which is trying to get out his window. He knows the robot is repairing itself somewhere and he opens it to let the bolt out. On the Langjökull glacier in Iceland various parts of the robot travel across there where his head rests, eyes glowing, as the robot wakes up and smiles.

23080180Rahul ([[Jeet , the son of a wealthy but traditional industrialist, returned home to his father after completing his academic career in foreign lands. When the father tries to persuade him in his marriage he puts up a fantastic condition - that he will marry the girl of his father’s choice and will live as married couple for one year only, after which, if either of the two seems to feel distant from the other, the marriage will be called off. Surprisingly, the traditional father agrees and chooses Pallavi , his PA as the most appropriate bride. Now Pallavi’s family consisted of her widowed mother, an elder sister deprived of her husband, a younger brother not at all competent for any job, and the youngest sister getting pregnant with the boyfriend trying to avoid responsibilities. So Pallavi, just to save her family, accepted the contract much against her wishes and thus began a curious way of life with both of the wedlocked couple leading an unreal lifestyle. Though both shared the same bed, but Rahul seemed to be oddly insensitive to Pallavi’s emotions. Thus it was not strange that he never cared to celebrate Pallavi’s birthday and his scathing remarks while appreciating Pallavi’s cooking hurt her feelings and duty seemed the only virtue that kept Rahul any closer to his wife. But the artificiality of the story is vividly brought to fore when Rahul, after quickly recovering from a comatose condition, chiefly due to Pallavi’s sincerest nursing, doesn’t hesitate to declare that the next day is the end of their contract term when he will be willingly divorcing Pallavi. Well at this point if the audience thought that the story is nearing a tragic completion, it is only the Intermission that is declared. In the second half we see that the table turns as Rahul suddenly feels sympathetic to Pallavi and all his passions overwhelms him so much that he rushes to his in-laws’ house and requests Pallavi’s return. But no says the director, and the story goes on with Pallavi now rejecting all the ardent proposals of Rahul, be it him buying all the shares of Pallavi’s new struggling organization just to secure for himself the position of Pallavi’s boss. Surprises seem to be on store for the audience with Pallavi conceiving a child  and now Rahul, in sympathy arranges for an AC bus for her and shifts her office to the ground floor. Now the only thing that remains is revelation and Pallavi invites and insults Rahul in one of the most improbable of settings with Rahul sophisticatedly defending his views. Finally after all these, the two again reunites in hospital bed after the severely injured Rahul takes Pallavi to the maternity ward  and they celebrate the simultaneous delivery of the child and Rahul’s recovery from his critical condition. Thus family ties are again restored and the happy ending is guaranteed.

Although Vera and her family are poor, their strong family bonds hold them together, and we see Vera's constant small acts of kindness to the many people she encounters throughout her day. Vera works as a house cleaner. However, unbeknownst to her family, she also serves as a backroom abortionist. She receives no money for this, believing her help to be an act of charity. However, Lily , who also carries on a black-market trade in scarce postwar foodstuffs, charges two guineas  for arranging the abortions, without Vera's knowledge. The film also contains a subplot about an upper class young woman, Susan , the daughter of one of Vera's employers. Susan is raped by a suitor, becomes pregnant, and asks a friend to put her in contact with a doctor, through whom she can obtain an abortion. The doctor first refers her to a psychiatrist, who prompts her to answer questions in a certain way, so that he can recommend an abortion on legal grounds: that she has a family history of mental illness and that she may commit suicide if not allowed to terminate the pregnancy. The abortion costs her a hundred guineas. After one of her patients nearly dies, Vera is arrested by the police and taken into custody for questioning. She is held overnight and appears before a magistrate the next morning. Sid is shocked by his mother's secret activities and tells his father that he does not think that he can forgive her.

3091469While Cobra Commander and Serpentor blame each other's stewardship of Cobra as the root cause of the organization's failures, a mysterious woman breaks into the Terror Drome. Cobra Commander leads the counter-attack, but in an attempt to rid himself of Serpentor, allows the intruder to escape. Reaching Serpentor, the intruder reveals herself as Pythona, who comes from a secret civilization known as Cobra-La. Pythona states that they were responsible for inspiring Doctor Mindbender to create Serpentor through dream manipulation. At her urging, Serpentor plans to capture G.I. Joe's newest weapon, the Broadcast Energy Transmitter , a device that, when activated, sends out surges of electrical power. Cobra assaults the Joes as they test the BET in the Himalayas. The Joes use the BET to activate their automated weapons systems and defeat the Cobra forces. Serpentor is captured and Cobra Commander orders a retreat. Cobra Commander leads his troops into the mountains, promising them a safe haven. A small detachment of G.I. Joe forces follow them. As the Joes celebrate their victory, a new group of rookie Joes are brought onto the team, including the allegedly clumsy kunoichi Jinx, military police officer Law and his dog Order, former basketball player Big Lob, EOD specialist Tunnel Rat, undercover officer Chuckles, and the rebellious slacker and half-brother to Duke, the green beret Lieutenant Falcon. Falcon and Duke dislike each other due to Falcon's immaturity and irresponsibility. Pursued by a cadre of G.I. Joe troops, Cobra Commander leads his forces to Cobra-La. An army of insect-armor wearing soldiers attack the Joe forces and imprison them within the Lovecraftian living environment of Cobra-La. The Cobra soldiers are met by Cobra-La's leader Golobulus. Golobulus orders Cobra Commander arrested as the rest of the group learns the secret origin of both Cobra-La and Cobra: Cobra-La was an ancient civilization that ruled the Earth, in part due to their advanced scientific knowledge that allowed them to manipulate and convert living creatures into advanced bio-organic technology. Their society was devastated by the onset of the Ice Age, forcing the survivors into caverns within the Himalayan mountains. As centuries passed, Cobra-La rebuilt their society in secret. Golobulus, hating humanity due to their polluting technology and ecologically unfriendly ways, vowed to wipe them off the face of the Earth, and found an agent in the form of a former nobleman who was working on biological weapons of mass destruction. A lab accident caused the nobleman's face to be permanently disfigured with eight additional eyes. Equipping him with a featureless silver facemask that allowed his multiple eyes to work normally, as well as a uniform that allowed him to pass for human, the nobleman became Cobra Commander and was charged with conquering the world for Cobra-La. However, Cobra Commander's repeated failures led Golobulus to arrange for Serpentor's creation, by implanting the inspiration to create Serpentor into Doctor Mindbender's brain with a small creature called a ""psychic motivator"". Golobulus punishes Cobra Commander for his repeated failures, exposing him to the biological weapon Cobra Commander disfigured himself developing years earlier: mutative spores that slowly transform Cobra Commander into a large snake. He escapes and makes his way to the Joes' camp with Roadblock, blinded in hand-to-hand combat with Golobulus' huge henchman, the Nemesis Enforcer.

4028951Chicago college student Max Hanson  is a talented artist and hockey player. Though more interested in the latter, he is under pressure from his mother, Sophie  to pursue a career in art, influenced by the fact that she put her own career aside to raise the family and has just landed a coveted position with a local art gallery. Max's father, Ed , is a tax attorney with a more laid-back approach to his son's future, just wanting him to be happy. While working at the local video store with best friends Orin  and Kate , a cute girl comes in with her friends seeking a copy of Arachnophobia, and Max is immediately smitten. After locating her on campus the next day, she introduces herself as Molly White , who already knows Max's name from his hockey jersey. She then gives Max her phone number and invites him to a party she's attending that night. Before long, Max and Molly are becoming an item, the two even managing to make love in his bedroom with his mother and younger sister Chloe in the house. However, Max soon finds out that Molly is a drug addict, as he accompanies her on a trek to score some heroin, which she promptly snorts. Max invites Molly to Chloe's birthday party, and though she initially refuses to attend because it's the same night as a Smashing Pumpkins concert, she later relents. However, a minor argument erupts between her and Sophie, resulting in Molly leaving abruptly and putting the brakes on their budding relationship. Devastated, Max does his best to move on, but has a hard time doing so. Finally, he's taken to a party one night by Orin and Kate, where he promptly spots Molly. She asks if they can go somewhere and talk; he accepts, she apologizes, and the two make up. The next day, Max visits Sophie at work and tries to express his feelings about Molly, but her response is less than positive. A short time later, Molly celebrates their new-found relationship by having them shoot up together in her apartment, and Max soon becomes hooked, neglecting his studies and job. Soon thereafter, Molly learns that she's three months behind on rent, and has a week to pay before being evicted. Not having enough money in his bank account to pay it, Max goes to the video store to get his paycheck, but having only worked two hours during the past week, that's all the pay he receives, and he is also given a pink slip. Sensing his friend may be in over his head, Orin offers to try to help Max, but all he wants is money to supposedly ""fix the car"" . After returning home, Max takes $200 from Ed's wallet; when he gently attempts to approach the subject with his son, even offering to help him out of his financial situation, an argument erupts that culminates in Sophie striking Max. Feeling as though he can never go back home, Max and Molly  move in with her druggie friends. Not long after, Max shows up at the ice rink attempting to steal money from Orin in the locker room, but is caught in the act . Once back at the pad, Max catches Molly having sex with a man in exchange for drugs, and physically confronts him. Later, as their financial situation worsens, the couple is reduced to panhandling at the local mall, where Sophie spots Max, but says nothing until a few days later. After hearing this news, Ed and his other son Brian attempt to find Max, but are unsuccessful. His addiction now totally out of control, Max tries to rob a local comic book store for drug money, but is caught by the police. Ed and Brian later bail Max out, and while Brian thinks he needs to be put into rehab, Ed insists he can take care of Max at home. However, the effects of withdrawal are in full swing, and it proves to be an uphill battle. Finally, after going into a rage, Max becomes unconscious and is taken to a hospital. Once there, an arguments erupts between Ed and Sophie, with Sophie insisting that she did what anyone else would have done, but Ed retorts ""that's a bunch of crap"" and reminds her that neither he nor the kids made her stop painting; she did it all by herself, and that in her self-absorbed attitude, she failed to notice that all Max wanted was ""to know it was OK to not be perfect"". The next day, a doctor informs the family that Max needs to get into a treatment program, but stresses the difficulty of doing so. However, while this discussion takes place, Max manages to slip out of the hospital and begins frantically searching for Molly, finally finding her in a sleazy motel room where she has died of a heroin overdose. Out of his mind with grief, Max shows up at Kate's apartment and begs her for money; when she refuses, he accuses her of ""wanting"" him and offers to prostitute himself. Enraged, Kate throws Max out of the apartment, but in his stupor, he takes a tumble down the stairwell. The following morning, after his family had searched unsuccessfully for him, Max is brought home in a taxi, Kate by his side. Informing his mother of Molly's death, the two tearfully embrace, and as he prepares to leave for his month-long stay in rehab, he and Sophie finally reach an understanding. Sophie admits that she never saw Max for who he was and encourages him to be whatever he wants, telling Max that she loves him as the two embrace again. The film ends with Max saying goodbye to Brian and Chloe as he departs for rehab, before he and Ed drive away.
18974432When an electrical power failure occurs, Mrs. Hilyard, a wealthy widow recuperating from a broken hip, becomes trapped between floors in the cage-like elevator she has installed in her mansion. With her son Malcolm away for a summer weekend, she relies on the elevator's emergency alarm to attract attention, but the only response comes from an alcoholic derelict, George, who enters the home, ignores her pleas and steals some small items. The wino sells them to a fence, then visits his prostitute friend, Sade, and tells her of the treasure trove he has stumbled upon. The expensive goods George fenced attracts the attention of three young hoodlums, Randall, Elaine, and Essie. The trio follows George and Sade back to the Hilyard home, where they conduct an orgy of violence, killing George the wino and locking Sade in a closet. Randall then pulls himself up to the elevator and taunts Mrs. Hilyard with a note left behind by her son Malcolm, in which he threatens suicide because of her domineering manner. Shocked by the revelation, Mrs. Hilyard struggles with Randall, escapes the elevator, and crawls out of the house.

2330126 The film begins with Turaga Vakama  describing a land that existed before Mata Nui called Metru Nui. The residents of the great city believed that the warriors known as the Toa would protect them, but eventually they were all defeated, save for one named ""Lhikan"". Lhikan travels throughout the entire city, giving Toa stones to six Matoran: Whenua, Nuju, Matau, Onewa, Nokama, and Vakama. After giving the last stone to Vakama, Lhikan is captured by two Dark Hunters called Nidhiki  and Krekka. Vakama later meets the other Matoran at the Great Temple in Ga-Metru; there, they are transformed into six new Toa. After Vakama has a vision, they all set out to recover the six Great Disks hidden throughout Metru Nui, believing that it would prove to Turaga Dume  that they are worthy Toa. Upon retrieving the disks , the Toa bring the disks to the Coliseum. However, Dume issues that ""small gifts"" won't confirm them as Toa. He then tests them by starting a sea of rising metal in the Coliseum. When the six fail to cross it, and Dume denounces them as ""imposters"", he unleashes the Vahki  upon them. In the process, Onewa, Nuju, and Whenua are sucked into a massive vortex and imprisoned while Vakama and the others escape the Coliseum by leaping into a chute system. However, the Dark Hunters follow them and manage to get the flow of the chute reversed. The Toa escape, but are left dangling from a dangerous height. While swinging to a tower, Matau falls, but is saved when he discovers that his blades can grant him flight. When the Toa reach the ground, Vakama discovers that the Great Disks can be fused together. He then spots Lhikan’s ""spirit star"" soaring overhead; as long as it burns in the night sky, it means that Lhikan is still alive. They hitched a ride on a Vahki transport to follow the star. When they arrived in Po-Metru, they encountered the Dark Hunters once more. Just when a battle is about to ensue, a herd of beasts called Kikanalo stampeded through canyons. As the Toa were fleeing, Nokama discovered that her mask allowed her to speak and understand the language of the Kikanalo. After stopping the stampede, she spoke to the leader of the herd and learned that Lhikan was taken to the Canyon of Unending Whispers. They were then taken to a large canyon guarded by Vahki. They managed to bypass the Vahki and the Dark Hunters with the help of the Kikanalo and Matau's newly discovered mask power of illusion. While the previous events occurred, Onewa and Whenua were unsuccessfully trying to break out of prison. They then met a Turaga. He explained that mask powers are needed to escape, and how they could be found. He then had the Toa perform seemingly pointless tasks. Eventually, Onewa and Whenua got into a fight in which Onewa discovered that his mask power was mind-control. Nuju then discovered his mask power, Telekinesis, and created a way out. Whenua found his mask power, night-vision, and provided illumination in the tunnel with his mask. They were then reunited with the other three Toa. When they debated where Lhikan was, the Turaga removed his helmet and revealed that he was Lhikan. Vakama finds a small canister holding Dume and learned that the Dume from before was an impostor. A squadron of Vahki suddenly attacked and the group fled on a spare transport. Meanwhile, ""Dume"" had summoned the Matoran to the Coliseum to be placed in the spheres. By the time the Toa arrived, it was too late; all the Matoran were now asleep. The false Dume then removed his mask and revealed himself to be Makuta Teridax. He plunged the Great Spirit Mata Nui into slumber and began absorbing energy from the city. He then absorbed Nivawk, Krekka, and Nidhiki, thus killing them. Whenua located the Matoran , who were underneath the Coliseum and stored in canisters. After surveying them, they realized that only a few of the Matoran can been carried on the transport and the rest would have to wait. They gathered as many of the spheres as possible, and began their journey out. Along the way, Vakama begins carving the Mask of Time from the disk when all visions he had previously seen reappeared and he came to a revelation: Teridax wanted control of time. To save the Matoran, the Toa must ""follow the light"". But as they neared, Teridax, now an immense winged being, attacked. Vakama attempted to use the Mask of Time when he confronted the Makuta, but Teridax then launched an attack. Because the Mask of Time only slowed time, Vakama could not avoid it. Just then, Lhikan leaped in and took the blow. The Mask of Time was knocked off of Vakama, and Teridax flew after it. As Lhikan lay dying, he explained to Vakama the Toa's duty to the Matoran. He then gave Vakama his mask and died. Anguished, Vakama discovered his mask power: invisibility. Just as Teridax was about to use the Mask of Time, Vakama knocked it away, and the mask fell into the sea. Teridax, enraged, attempts to kill Vakama. After a deadly battle, Vakama managed to trick Teridax into grabbing a towering boulder which slammed him into a wall. The Toa gathered and, combining their powers, sealed Teridax in a protodermis prison. The Toa continued towards the light and arrived on the island of Mata Nui. When all the Matoran Spheres were placed on the beach of Mata Nui, the Toa discharged energy into the spheres, becoming Turaga in the process, and awakened the Matoran. One of the Matoran, Takua, led Vakama to a Matoran whose mask was shattered. Vakama gave this Matoran, Jaller, Lhikan's mask and its shape changed to become his. The film then ends with the other Matoran cheering while the symbol of the Three Virtues  appeared in the sky.

789978Luc  spends his holiday at the sea with his slightly older and decidedly more effeminate boyfriend Sébastien . At the house they have rented, Sébastien's dancing and preening frustrates Luc, who rebukes him that the neighbors might see. Irritated, Luc goes off on his bicycle to the beach, hoping to find some solitude. On the beach Luc is finally alone and goes skinny dipping. Afterward, he sunbathes in the nude, and then he meets Lucia , a Spanish tourist about his age, who, after some flirtatious conversation invites Luc to accompany her into the nearby wood for a tryst. Luc, though somewhat bashful, obliges with little hesitation. After having sex, Lucia learns that Luc is erotically involved with Sébastien and has never been with a woman. The two return to the beach to find that Luc's clothes have been stolen. Lucia lends Luc her summer dress so that he won't have to return home completely naked. Wearing a woman's dress improves Luc's mood as a car honks its horn after him on the ride back. He returns to the cabin with a smile and a renewed sense of freedom. Luc surprises Sébastien on entering, and, after a few amused remarks about the dress , the two have passionate sex in the kitchen. The dress is partially torn in the act. The next day, Luc mends the summer dress and brings it back to Lucia, who is just leaving, but she refuses to accept it, coyly suggesting that it may come in handy in the future. She kisses Luc goodbye, and the final frame shows Luc watching her depart, the dress wrapped around his neck and fluttering in the sea breeze.

His method for reassessing his life is to narrate it to his class and interweave in it three generations of his family's history. The movie portrays the teacher's narrative in the form of flashbacks to tell the story of a teenage boy and his mentally challenged older brother living on the fens of England with their widowed father.

4949692The film tells the fictionalised story of Désirée Clary and her relationship with Napoleon. In 1794, in Marseille, Désirée Clary  makes the acquaintance of a Corsican named Joseph Bonaparte  and invites him and his brother, Gen. Napoleon Bonaparte , to call upon the family the following day. The next day, Julie , Désirée's sister and Joseph are immediately attracted to each other, and Napoleon is taken with Désirée. He admits to her that the poor Bonaparte brothers need the rich dowries of the Clary sisters. Later, Désirée learns that Napoleon has been arrested and taken to Paris. Napoleon eventually returns to Marseille, tells Désirée that he has been cleared of all charges, but has been ordered to track down royalists in Paris. Désirée begs Napoleon to leave the Army and join her brother in business, but he scoffs at the idea and instead proposes marriage. Désirée accepts and lends Napoleon the money to return to Paris. Napoleon tells her that he will always love her and will return soon for their wedding but, as the months pass, Désirée begins to doubt him and goes to the city where she meets General Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte . She learns that Napoleon is engaged to the wealthy, Joséphine de Beauharnais . Désirée contemplates suicide, but she is stopped by Bernadotte who falls in love with her. Later, in 1797, Napoleon, now France’s leading general, has succeeded in conquering Italy, and Désirée lives in Rome with Julie and Joseph. She soon tires of Rome, however, and decides to return to Paris, where she meets Napoleon, now married to Josephine, who announces that he will be leaving for Egypt. Bernadotte is thrilled to see Désirée again and proposes marriage to her. By July 4, 1799, Désirée and Bernadotte have happily settled into married life and have a son, Oskar. On November 9, 1799, Napoleon is proclaimed First Consul of the French Republic and asks Bernadotte to join his council of state. Bernadotte agrees. Several years later, Napoleon is proclaimed emperor, and at his coronation he takes the crown from the hands of Pope Pius VII and crowns himself. Five years later, desperate for an heir, Napoleon divorces Josephine, and Désirée comforts her former rival, before Napoleon’s upcoming marriage to the eighteen-year-old Marie Louise of Austria . Napoleon involves France in more wars, and Bernadotte is approached by representatives of the king of Sweden, who wishes to adopt him and make him the heir to the throne. Désirée, stunned by the news that she will one day be a queen, nevertheless supports her husband, and eventually Napoleon allows both of them to leave Paris. In Stockholm, Désirée does not fit in with the royal family and asks to go home. Eight months later, she attends a ball in Paris at which Napoleon shows off his new son. Napoleon makes veiled threats about Bernadotte’s alliance with Russia and announces to the crowd that she will be held hostage to ensure Sweden’s support while his army marches through Russia to Moscow. Napoleon’s army is defeated and he visits Désirée and asks her to write a letter to Bernadotte, requesting his help. Désirée realizes that Napoleon still loves her and came more for her than to seek her husband’s help. Soon after, Bernadotte leads one of the armies that overwhelms Napoleon, and the triumphant general reunites with Désirée before returning to Sweden. Napoleon’s exile to Elba is short-lived, however, and after the battle of Waterloo, Napoleon retreats with his personal army to the Château de Malmaison. Representatives of the allied armies ask Désirée to speak with Napoleon, hoping that she can persuade him to surrender. Napoleon agrees to speak with Désirée alone, and muses on what his destiny would have been if he had married her. Napoleon proclaims that he has given his life to protect France, but Désirée gently tells him that he must do as France asks and go into exile on St. Helena. Commenting on how strange it is that the two most outstanding men of their time had fallen in love with her, Napoleon gives Désirée his sword in surrender, and assures her that her dowry was not the only reason he proposed to her many years ago in Marseille.

Worried that they will get caught, Hogarth evades Mansley and takes the robot to beatnik artist Dean McCoppin who passes off the robot as one of his works of art when Mansley and Lieutenant General Rogard investigate. Hogarth inadvertently activates a self-defense mechanism  in the giant with a toy gun, but Dean saves Hogarth. Commanding the robot to leave, they soon realize that the robot cannot control the SDM, and they chase after it before reaching town. In Rockwell, the robot saves two boys, but Mansley, having seen it, orders an attack to stop it. The robot flees with Hogarth until he is shot down by a missile, and after crash landing, the robot believes Hogarth to be dead, causing the enraged robot to activate its weapons and attack the Army, who are no match for the advanced firepower. Mansley lies to Rogard that the robot killed Hogarth, before telling him to lure the robot out to sea so they can destroy it with a nuclear ballistic missile from the USS Nautilus. Hogarth  wakes up and calms the robot down, causing it to deactivate its weapons. Dean tells Rogard and his men to stand down. Rogard, realizing that Mansley lied to him, is about to tell the Nautilus to stand down, but Mansley snatches the walkie-talkie and calls the Nautilus to launch the missile anyway. Realizing the deadly mistake, Rogard argues with Mansley and informs him that the robot, along with everybody in Rockwell will be destroyed when the missile falls. Mansley refuses to take note of the town's fate and tries to escape Rockwell in order to save himself, but the robot stops Mansley, who is then arrested by the Army. When Hogarth tells the robot about Rockwell's fate, the robot flies off to intercept the missile, as a hero, not a weapon. The robot and missile collide, causing a massive explosion high up in the atmosphere. The people of the town recognize the giant as a hero, but everyone, especially Hogarth is deeply saddened by the robot's sacrifice. Some time later, Annie and Dean have a romantic relationship and Dean creates a statue honoring the robot. Hogarth receives a package from Rogard, containing the only piece of the robot they found, a small jaw bolt. That night, Hogarth awakens to a familiar beeping coming from the bolt, which is trying to get out his window. He knows the robot is repairing itself somewhere and he opens it to let the bolt out. On the Langjökull glacier in Iceland various parts of the robot travel across there where his head rests, eyes glowing, as the robot wakes up and smiles.

Jerry, frustrated, can only stand there and look on. Just then, a little green devil  appears, presumably as Jerry's ""evil nature"" . He convinces Jerry, Tom is trouble when he is with a dame. The devil recalls the time when Tom met a female cat on the beach, leading to a flashback of 1947's Salt Water Tabby, where Jerry's interference embarrassed Tom, and lead to Tom shooting Jerry into the sea through a fizzy cola bottle. The devil then reminds Jerry of the time when Tom invited a feline over for a meal in 1945's The Mouse Comes to Dinner, where Jerry was forced to serve the food and blow Tom's soup. The frustrated mouse spit Tom's soup in his face, which caused Tom to place the spoon that Jerry is standing on, directly above a candle flame, which burned Jerry's bottom and feet, lauching the mouse into a block of butter to cool off . After that, Jerry is reminded of the time Tom fell in love with a cow-girl in 1950's Texas Tom . Tom confidently strided up to the cat and smoked a roll-up cigarette , which blew out the word ""Howdy"" in smoke. Back in the garden, the devil and Jerry spy on Tom flirting suggestively. They realise that Tom is planning to serenade his lover soon. The devil asks Jerry if he can take that again, reminding him of 1946's Solid Serenade, where Tom sang Is You Is Or Is You Ain't My Baby, which woke Jerry up in the process and destroying his home. The devil sends Jerry on his way to stir up trouble, armed with a hatpin, mini TNT, and some matches. As Jerry marches over towards Tom, he suddenly spots an attractive female mouse and falls head over heels in love with her, dangling out his tongue as she giggles. The devil, frustrated, laments the trouble with dames. Just then, he suddenly spots an attractive female devil and falls head over heels in love with her, dangling out his tongue as she giggles.

23080180Rahul ([[Jeet , the son of a wealthy but traditional industrialist, returned home to his father after completing his academic career in foreign lands. When the father tries to persuade him in his marriage he puts up a fantastic condition - that he will marry the girl of his father’s choice and will live as married couple for one year only, after which, if either of the two seems to feel distant from the other, the marriage will be called off. Surprisingly, the traditional father agrees and chooses Pallavi , his PA as the most appropriate bride. Now Pallavi’s family consisted of her widowed mother, an elder sister deprived of her husband, a younger brother not at all competent for any job, and the youngest sister getting pregnant with the boyfriend trying to avoid responsibilities. So Pallavi, just to save her family, accepted the contract much against her wishes and thus began a curious way of life with both of the wedlocked couple leading an unreal lifestyle. Though both shared the same bed, but Rahul seemed to be oddly insensitive to Pallavi’s emotions. Thus it was not strange that he never cared to celebrate Pallavi’s birthday and his scathing remarks while appreciating Pallavi’s cooking hurt her feelings and duty seemed the only virtue that kept Rahul any closer to his wife. But the artificiality of the story is vividly brought to fore when Rahul, after quickly recovering from a comatose condition, chiefly due to Pallavi’s sincerest nursing, doesn’t hesitate to declare that the next day is the end of their contract term when he will be willingly divorcing Pallavi. Well at this point if the audience thought that the story is nearing a tragic completion, it is only the Intermission that is declared. In the second half we see that the table turns as Rahul suddenly feels sympathetic to Pallavi and all his passions overwhelms him so much that he rushes to his in-laws’ house and requests Pallavi’s return. But no says the director, and the story goes on with Pallavi now rejecting all the ardent proposals of Rahul, be it him buying all the shares of Pallavi’s new struggling organization just to secure for himself the position of Pallavi’s boss. Surprises seem to be on store for the audience with Pallavi conceiving a child  and now Rahul, in sympathy arranges for an AC bus for her and shifts her office to the ground floor. Now the only thing that remains is revelation and Pallavi invites and insults Rahul in one of the most improbable of settings with Rahul sophisticatedly defending his views. Finally after all these, the two again reunites in hospital bed after the severely injured Rahul takes Pallavi to the maternity ward  and they celebrate the simultaneous delivery of the child and Rahul’s recovery from his critical condition. Thus family ties are again restored and the happy ending is guaranteed.

Arrested while performing his duties as a physician, he is convicted of treason against the King and sentenced to death by the infamous Judge Jeffreys in the Bloody Assizes, but by the whim of King James II , Peter Blood and the surviving rebels are transported to the West Indies to be sold into slavery. In the English colony of Port Royal, Peter Blood is purchased by Arabella Bishop , the beautiful niece of the local military commander Colonel Bishop. Arabella, attracted by Blood's rebellious nature, does her best to improve his chances of living by recommending him as the personal physician of the local governor, who is suffering from a gouty foot. Outwardly resentful towards Arabella for trying to do him favors, but on the inside silently appreciative for her support, Blood nevertheless continues to hatch a plan of escape for himself and his fellow slaves. The plan is almost foiled when Bishop gets suspicious and has one of the men flogged in an attempt to make him talk, and Blood is spared a similar fate when a Spanish squadron attacks the town, During the raid, Blood and his fellow slaves escape, seize control of the Spanish raiders' ship and sail away to begin a life of piracy, in which Blood soon achieves incredible success and fame. When the old governor is unable to contain the pirate menace, Colonel Bishop is promoted to his post, and Arabella is sent to England for a recreational sojourn. Some years later, whilst travelling back to the Caribbean, the ship on which Arabella and royal emissary Lord Willoughby  are travelling is captured by Blood's treacherous partner, Captain Levasseur  and the two personages held for ransom.

However, when Willoughby reveals that James II has since been deposed in the Glorious Revolution and that Willoughby has been sent by the new king, William of Orange, to offer a full pardon, emancipation, and a commission with the Royal Navy to Blood and his men, they joyfully change their minds at this good news and prepare for battle. After setting Arabella ashore, they approach the harbor disguised under French colors and save the colony in a pitched battle. As a reward, Blood is appointed the new governor of the colony and has the pleasure to deal with his hostile predecessor, now in serious trouble for dereliction of duty, and finally wins the hand and heart of Arabella.

It is run by Tama Riyada, a crime lord, who is the target of the task force. While detaining various tenants of the apartment, the team eventually detains a man who is delivering medicine to his sick wife. However, before the team enters the apartment, he escapes. The team infiltrates the apartment block floor by floor until they reach the sixth floor. However, the team is seen by a young lookout, who raises the alarm before he is shot and killed. Tama calls in reinforcements, who systematically take out a majority of the SWAT members and regain control of most of the apartment. Tama turns off the power to the whole building and announces that the SWAT team is trapped on the sixth floor and he will grant free permanent residence to those who kill the intruders. The team is soon ambushed by shooters from above, as well as others who flank them from behind. During the battle, Jaka learns from Wahyu that the mission isn't sanctioned by the force, meaning they can't call for backup. The team runs to another room, where Bowo is shot and injured. The team narrowly escape after Rama improvises an explosion that kills the pursuing tenants. The team splits into two groups; Jaka, Wahyu, and Dagu go to the fifth floor, while Rama and Bowo retreat to seventh. Rama and Bowo make their way to the apartment of the man with the sick wife, who reluctantly agrees to hide them. They hide in a secret passage behind a wall. A gang arrives and inspects the man's apartment, but they find no one, and leave. After removing the bullet stuck in Bowo, Rama leaves him in the care of the man's family as he goes out and fights again. Rama is eventually captured by Andi, Tama's right hand man. At the same time, Jaka and his group are found by Mad Dog, Tama's ruthless henchman. Wahyu makes his escape, and Dagu is ordered to follow him. Jaka, with only a knife, is confronted by Mad Dog, who holds him at gunpoint. Mad Dog leads Jaka to his apartment, where he challenges Jaka to a fight and kills him. Meanwhile at Andi's apartment, Andi reveals himself to be Rama's estranged brother. Andi lets Rama know when it will be safe as he meets up with Mad Dog, who drags Jaka's body to Tama. Tama learns of Andi's betrayal from the closed-circuit camera footage of Rama, who goes to Andi's apartment; Tama stabs Andi in the hand before turning him over to Mad Dog. Rama regroups with Wahyu and Dagu, who go on to fight in a narcotics lab, and then to the 15th floor where Tama is located. On the way up, Rama finds a room where Andi is being beaten by Mad Dog. As he enters, Mad Dog frees Andi. Rama and Andi team up against Mad Dog, and after sustaining more brutal beatings, eventually kill him.

Rama and Andi run into Wahyu and Tama, but are fired at by Wahyu. While Wahyu keeps the two at bay, Tama gloats that his actions are futile because of the corruption on the police force. After realizing the depth of corruption, and his eventual arrest, Wahyu shoots Tama in the head; he attempts to shoot himself, but runs out of bullets. Andi gives Rama a list of corrupt officers. Rama asks Andi to come along, but he refuses, due to his acclimation to his lifestyle. Andi returns to the apartment, while Rama leaves with Bowo and a detained Wahyu.

During the battle, Jaka learns from Wahyu that the mission isn't sanctioned by the force, meaning they can't call for backup. The team runs to another room, where Bowo is shot and injured. The team narrowly escape after Rama improvises an explosion that kills the pursuing tenants. The team splits into two groups; Jaka, Wahyu, and Dagu go to the fifth floor, while Rama and Bowo retreat to seventh. Rama and Bowo make their way to the apartment of the man with the sick wife, who reluctantly agrees to hide them. They hide in a secret passage behind a wall. A gang arrives and inspects the man's apartment, but they find no one, and leave. After removing the bullet stuck in Bowo, Rama leaves him in the care of the man's family as he goes out and fights again. Rama is eventually captured by Andi, Tama's right hand man. At the same time, Jaka and his group are found by Mad Dog, Tama's ruthless henchman. Wahyu makes his escape, and Dagu is ordered to follow him. Jaka, with only a knife, is confronted by Mad Dog, who holds him at gunpoint. Mad Dog leads Jaka to his apartment, where he challenges Jaka to a fight and kills him. Meanwhile at Andi's apartment, Andi reveals himself to be Rama's estranged brother. Andi lets Rama know when it will be safe as he meets up with Mad Dog, who drags Jaka's body to Tama. Tama learns of Andi's betrayal from the closed-circuit camera footage of Rama, who goes to Andi's apartment; Tama stabs Andi in the hand before turning him over to Mad Dog. Rama regroups with Wahyu and Dagu, who go on to fight in a narcotics lab, and then to the 15th floor where Tama is located. On the way up, Rama finds a room where Andi is being beaten by Mad Dog. As he enters, Mad Dog frees Andi. Rama and Andi team up against Mad Dog, and after sustaining more brutal beatings, eventually kill him. Meanwhile, Wahyu and Dagu confront Tama, but Wahyu shoots and kills Dagu. Wahyu is convinced that holding Tama hostage will allow him to escape. Rama and Andi run into Wahyu and Tama, but are fired at by Wahyu. While Wahyu keeps the two at bay, Tama gloats that his actions are futile because of the corruption on the police force. After realizing the depth of corruption, and his eventual arrest, Wahyu shoots Tama in the head; he attempts to shoot himself, but runs out of bullets. Andi gives Rama a list of corrupt officers. Rama asks Andi to come along, but he refuses, due to his acclimation to his lifestyle. Andi returns to the apartment, while Rama leaves with Bowo and a detained Wahyu.

An old man, Joris Ivens, sits on a chair in the Gobi Desert. On the sand dunes around him a group of men are raising poles with microphones. An old Chinese man practices martial arts with several younger men in front of a traditional Chinese building. Ivens, who is 90 years old, has been asthmatic since childhood, and asks the man how he manages to breathe so well. The literary character Sun Wukong, in a Peking opera appearance, watches from a tree. The man answers that ""the secret of breathing lies in the rhythm of the autumn wind"". The man begins to dance. Sun Wukong then throws a banana peel before the man, who slips and falls. Ivens helps him up. Ivens visits the Golden Hands Buddha at the Dazu Rock Carvings. Intercut are Chinese landscapes seen from the air and footage of stormy weather. The Leshan Giant Buddha is seen. In the Gobi Desert, the team of technicians set up a camp. Ivens uses an inhaler and is swiftly examined by a doctor. A member of the group says that the wind will not appear for several days. The following day, Ivens falls from his chair in the desert and is brought to a hospital. Sun Wukong visits him in the hospital bed. In an extended dream sequence, the spaceship from the film A Trip to the Moon brings Ivens to the Moon. There he encounters the goddess Chang'e who tells him there is no wind on the Moon. Ivens finds that remarkable. In a stylised village where a wedding is taking place, a communist representative holds a speech about how fortunate the villagers are. Sun Wukong turns up and pulls the plug to the representative's microphone, and makes the loudspeakers play Western pop music instead. Ivens is briefly seen in Sun Wukong's make-up. Ivens enters a cavern, where men greet him and say that he is expected. At the end of the cavern there is a mask from which a strong wind blows from the mouth. Ivens says that he wants to meet the man who made the mask, which is arranged. The man explains the mask's mythological symbology and gives it to Ivens, who in return gives the man a print of his 1930 film Breakers. Ivens is carried to the top of a mountain to record the sound of wind. Footage is seen from the Japanese invasion of China, which Ivens filmed in 1938. Footage from the air is seen of the Great Wall of China, partially covered in desert sand. Trying to film the Terracotta Army, Ivens and Marceline Loridan only obtain permission to film for ten minutes, which would not be enough.

Their relationship is strained, to say the least, as Alice finds herself in service to Nanny’s unrelenting demands. Alice is subjugated to bizarre psychological and physical abuses from Nanny, who quickly reveals herself as Alice's worse nightmare. The final conflict comes as a result of Alice's adoption of a white rabbit. Nanny Dearest forbids having a “rodent” as a pet  and sentences the poor bunny to death. Despite numerous creative attempts to put an end to the him, Nanny takes increasingly severe action when the ""damn rabbit keeps coming back."" With Nanny’s wickedness now revealed in full force, she instigates the ultimate solution, flushing the poor creature down the toilet. Engorged with her own mad power, Nanny flushes Alice down the “rabbit hole” as well. Alice lands in a surreal “Wonderland”  populated by perverse creatures who would make Lewis Carrol turn over in his grave. Alice's white rabbit, now incarnated as a rapping, hip-hop “White Chocolate,” becomes the first of many encounters with eccentric characters who have found their way into Wonderland, including a boozy Glinda the Good Witch , a hookah smoking Penispillar in his mushroom forest and a naughty Cheshire Cat, smiling for all the wrong reasons. Then, after stumbling upon Trannie Dee and Trannie Dum’s trailer park where Alice is introduced to a little Wonderland magic, the Mad Hatter serves up Titmouse tea at a truly twisted Tea Party. When Alice ultimately crosses paths with the evil and insatiable Red Queen, she is offered her first Birthday Orgy. In a fit of jealousy, the King frames Alice with an illegal wire hanger, and the Queen invariably demands Alice’s beheadment. Barely escaping with her head, Alice returns to the “real world” where she recognizes her past sins of using wire hangers and not eating enough red meat. With her work done, Nanny declares “She's off, Chim Chimeree and all that,” to horrify another child... or so she thinks!"

This threatens the plans of Henry Mitchell , who holds exclusive logging rights for the forest. Mitchell figures that if the moths infest and kill the trees, he can harvest all the dead trees, unencumbered by logging restrictions. When Carter tries to phone in the infestation threat, Mitchell covertly cuts the line, forcing Carter to ride into town to report the problem. Meanwhile along the trail, Gene Autry  and Forester Joe Lucas , who have ben drinking, come across a mountain lion, and Gene fires several shots at the wild animal. Mitchell, who has been following the forester, uses the last shot as cover to shoot Carter in the back, leaving him where Autry will assume Carter was killed by his errant shot. At the inquest, Gene is cleared of any charges, and he is freed. He sells his interest in his forest camp, leaving the money to Carter's daughter, Helen . In grief, he decides to leave the area, but then discovers the moth infestation for himself. Reporting it to the forest service and discovering that his shot could not have killed Carter, he is hired to run a program of aerial spraying of DDT to kill the moth larva before the forest is destroyed. Gene includes his pal, Joe, in the aerial program, but Joe's problems with alcohol, triggered by the death of his wife, lead to trouble. Meanwhile, Mitchell has hatched a plot to stop the DDT spraying by covertly spraying a very potent poison over the local livestock, blaming the resulting sickness and death on the DDT. Joe, who has returned to sobriety with the help of Autry, finds the plane and poison being used by Mitchell, but is shot by one of Mitchell's henchmen, Bill Wright , as he rides to report the problem. Helen finds Joe and, with the help of Dr. Chadwick , brings him back from the brink of death. When Joe recovers consciousness, he reports his findings to Gene. When he learns that Wright has aroused the locals to stop the spraying operation, Gene rides to intercept them before they can destroy the planes. He reports Wright's scheme, and convinces some of the locals to go with him to check it out. Wright has dismantled the plane, and when the locals leave, he captures Gene and Forester Jerry . They soon escape, however, and arrive at the airfield on time for a brawl to save the aircraft. The sheriff shows up, breaks up the fight, and confiscates everyone's weapons. With the help of Helen and Dr. Chadwick, Gene makes Mitchell and Wright believe he is holding the bullet removed from the injured Joe, and that it will be traced to Wright's confiscated rifle. Mitchell, Wright, and Pete ride to confront Autry, with Mitchell dropping off at a shack along the way to ambush Gene, should he get away. Wright confronts Gene, and after more fighting, he gets away. Pete, however, is captured and leads Gene to a trap by telling him he can find Wright at the shack where Mitchell is waiting. Later, Pete tries to cut a deal by confessing the truth. Joe realizes he will never catch up to Gene in time to save him, so he rides to the airfield to try an aerial intercept. Wright forces his way onto the plane at gunpoint to escape justice, but once in the air, Joe points out that if he is shot there is no one to fly the aircraft. Joe flies over Gene to warn him, and when that doesn't work, he selflessly crashes the plane into the shack, killing Wright, Mitchell, and himself. Gene returns to finish the spraying job, with the clear understanding that his future includes a permanent forestry job and married life with Helen.

Ham and Ex have an ambition of becoming firefighters and play around with their Uncle's fire engine and equipment. Annoyed by their fiddling around, Beans has them seated on a bench, but when his back is turned, Ham and Ex accidentally set off the fire alarm, waking the other firemen, only to realise on their return it was a false alarm. Beans has Ham and Ex grounded in the sleeping quarters. Once he's left, Ham and Ex jump out of their beds and down the fire pole. Then they get in the fire engine and drive off through the station wall into the street, to Beans' horror. Beans runs after them as they clumsily crash and bump their way around the city. Finally they drive back to the station and hop back into bed just as Beans returns. He notices they appear to be asleep before he can belt them. As Beans exits the room, Ham and Ex toss a fireman's boot at him. Entirely fed up with their bad behaviour, Beans drags them to one end of the bed and spanks them.

Slowly, she pulls herself out of bed and goes to the source; her autistic teenage daughter Mandy . Mandy is suffering an anxiety attack, as she has almost every night for months. Jeanne instructs her daughter to “use her strategies.” Finally, Jeanne distracts her out of this fit by singing a familiar lullaby: “Lady bug, lady bug, fly away home.” The next morning, Jeanne struggles to dress her 15 year-old daughter, who can’t yet do so by herself, and to board her onto the awaiting school bus. Afterwards, she walks their family beagle, while receiving a cell phone call from her free-lance business partner, Sue . They’re under pressure to deliver a high-profile cost analysis report to a major client. Jeanne jumps into the task with characteristic determination. Despite Sue’s protest, Jeanne promises the client they will deliver it by Monday. But her work is soon interrupted by a call from the school. Mandy’s had another violent fit, disrupting the class. Jeanne rushes to the school, and encounters the dedicated but gruff principal, Liz Howell , who suggests this might not be the right placement for Mandy. Since Mandy’s failed in three different schools over the past two years, Jeanne is resolute to keep her in this one. Desperate for help, Jeanne calls Mandy’s father, Peter , asking if he could take Mandy for the weekend. He makes his usual excuses, but then surprises them by showing up, and sweeping Mandy off to the park. Jeanne is enjoying a rare moment of peace when Peter calls, in great distress. Mandy’s had another fit, attacking yet another child on the playground. Jeanne rushes to the rescue, and takes control of the situation. The next day, Jeanne takes a break to walk her dog and meets a new neighbor, Tom . He’s charming, and sparks begin to fly. Jeanne remembers that she is a woman, not just a function. Then her cell phone rings and it’s the school, once again. Mandy’s had another fit and Jeanne rushes off, leaving Tom behind and bewildered. This time, Mandy’s fit was so extreme that she is suspended for a week. Jeanne is beside herself. Over the next few days, her world becomes even more unhinged, as she struggles to complete her report, while attending to Mandy’s round-the-clock needs. It’s an impossible task, and she fails. The report is hastily done and she is fired. The next day, Jeanne takes Mandy with her to the dog park. Tom is there as well. Surprisingly, he is charmed by Mandy’s eccentricity, and offers to take them all out for pizza. Unused to flirtatious attention from a man, Jeanne refuses. But Mandy’s enthusiasm wins out. They have a lovely time and Tom escorts them home, where he engages in delightful play with Mandy. Later, over a cup of tea, he and Jeanne grow closer. But when he moves his hand to take hers, Jeanne freezes. Why would he want to get involved with her, and this engulfing struggle? And if she cared about him, how could she let him? Rebuffed, Tom leaves the house…and her life. Overcome by the sacrifice she has made, yet again, Jeanne sucks up her sorrow and forges on. Mandy has another fit and is kicked out of the school. Jeanne’s only option is to enroll her child in a therapeutic residential facility. But how can she? Mandy’s body might be mature, but her mind and spirit is that of a young child. How can she abandon such a vulnerable girl to strangers? Driving Mandy back from their final confrontation with Liz Howell, Jeanne contemplates veering off the road into a tree, and ending their suffering. She stops herself, last minute. In a poignant moment of surprising attunement, Mandy consoles her mother, singing to Jeanne as she had been sung to; “Fly away home…” In the days to come, Mandy and Jeanne become increasingly unable to cope. While walking their dog, Mandy breaks away and with unexpected speed, runs off. Jeanne cannot find her. For hours, Mandy is lost and Jeanne is desperate. Until Tom arrives, returning her. He found Mandy hiding in the dog park. Jeanne’s gratitude hints at renewed possibility between them. At last, Jeanne realizes that the residential facility is Mandy’s last, best chance. She suggests it to Peter. They meet with a professional advisor, to discuss this difficult choice. Although she suggested it, Jeanne is anguished at the thought of losing her child. She can’t bring herself to “sending her away.” In the parking lot after the meeting, Jeanne sees a plane over-head. The sight of it flying freely causes an internal shift.

When the master joins them it is hinted that he is a gangster who has sought out this writer in particular to record his story. As the story begins, we learn that the 'master' was once himself a servant named Bangja, who served the aristocratic scholar Lee Mong-ryong. Throughout the movie, the scene switches between the 'present' Bang providing the narration, and the flashback events of his past. In his capacity as a servant Bangja shares his rooms with Mr. Ma, a notorious womanizer and self-stylized Lothario. Bang escorts his master  to an evening out at the local pleasure house, where they are witness to a performance by the madam's daughter Chunhyang. While trying to arrange a meeting between Chunhyang and his rather clumsy and socially awkward master, Bang defends Mong-ryong from a larger, disgruntled patron and inadvertently impresses both Chunhyang and her maidservant Hyangdan. Mr. Ma begins to coach the simple, honest Bangja in the ways of seducing women, which Bang uses to secure a picnic outing for Mong-ryong with Chunhyang through Hyangdan. During the excursion, Bangja so astounds the ladies by cooking meat to perfection, recovering Chunhyang's slipper from the waterfall pool, and carrying her on his back after she injured her ankle, that a love triangle rapidly begins to form between the two women and Bangja, much to the consternation of Mong-ryong, though he boasts that he is slowly luring Chunhyang to him by playing hard to get. While his master continues to study, Bangja attempts to court Chunhyang. Mr. Ma continues to provide instruction to Bangja, assuaging his concerns when he thinks his master may have slept with her, and pushing him to seize upon spending the night with her before his master can. Though Bangja's seduction is clumsy and his approach very tentative, Chunhyang begins to fall for him and makes love to him on several occasions. Due to his low social-standing, however, she seeks to marry Mong-ryong and enlists Bangja's help in order to make this plan a reality. When Mong-ryong is called away to Seoul to finish studying and take his exam he asks Bangja to recover a written promise he gave Chunhyang about marrying her. She catches Bangja as he tries to steal the paper, and switches it for a confession letter she wrote and got him to sign the night the two of them first had sex. Mong-ryong reads the letter and dismisses Bangja from his service for having deceived him. Three years pass, and Bangja and Chunhyang grow closer and continue to love each other while Bangja becomes the servant of Chunhyang's house and runs errands for a local strong man. However, Chunhyang begins to take after her mother and grows increasingly manipulative despite her burgeoning love for Bangja. In Seoul, Mong-ryong takes his exams and becomes a Royal Inspector. After insulting the court eunuchs however, he is accorded a lowly position in his home town, subservient to the new governor. Mong-ryong finds Hyangdan has become the madam of her own house and runs a successful business. She sleeps with Mong-ryong and asks him if she is not more desirable and pleasing than Chunhyang, but expresses remorse that Bangja chose Chunhyang over her. Mong-ryong discusses women with his magistrate and later returns to Chunhyang's house. Mong-ryong goes for a walk with Chunhyang, and though it is not revealed what the two discussed, Chunhyang returns with a pleased expression and an expectation of seeing Mong-ryong again. The magistrate visits Chunhyang's house and after a confrontation with his own clerks and then Bangja, is greeted by a beautiful, but uncooperative Chunhyang who refuses to sit and pour his drinks because she is not a gisaeng. Enraged by her arrogance, the governor beats Bangja when he attempts to interfere, and has Chunhyang imprisoned. Bangja goes to Mong-ryong and implores his old master to help save her life. Later, during a celebration, the magistrate is seen in a back room attempting to sexually excite Chunhyang because Mong-ryong had told him that she would only bow to his wishes and fulfill his desires if he were violent with her. Bangja causes a commotion to get the magistrate to release her, but is saved from being beaten by the guards when Mong-ryong arrives with a large contingent of guards. Mong-ryong arrests the magistrate and has Chunhyang whipped for her insolence until Bangja interferes, claiming that she has a husband whom she was remaining faithful to. Chunhyang stabs herself with a small blade, saying to Mong-ryong  that she wanted news of her death taken to Master Lee Mong-ryong. Bangja is visited in his cell, first by Mr. Ma, who warns him to never beg a woman to stay, then by Chunhyang, who reveals that she and Mong-ryong planned the whole event after he returned from his exams. For the first time, Bangja confesses his love to Chunhyang, who leaves him. Distraught by these event, she then tells Mong-ryong that she will not leave without Bangja, and so the three of them depart the city together. When the trio stop at the waterfall where they had their first excursion years before, Mong-ryong pushes Chunhyang down the falls and she is seen face-down in the water. Bangja dives in to save her and runs away, carrying her on his back as he did when she injured her ankle. The 'present' Bangja tells the writer that he ran from Mong-ryong and his agents for a long time after those events. The last thing he does to bring the story to close is bring the writer to the back of his warehouse to see Chunhyang who survived the fall, but was left with brain damage and has 'become a child'. The writer declares that Bangja is an amazing man and will make him the hero of a wonderful story about a servant's love, but Bangja insists that the story be told with her fabricated fidelity being the truth, and Chunhyang living happily ever after with a Lee Mong-ryong who loved her and returned for her. When asked why, he says it was because it was something she never got to have, and he is happy with being the hero in his heart. Bangja requests one scene be written to demonstrate the love between the two characters, which he demonstrates by carrying Chunhyang around the room on his back and singing a variation of the song from the pansori Chunhyangga while she smiles lovingly and snow flakes slowly fall on them from the open roof. The last scenes are of people in the village where they lived, the times when she entertained guests at her house with her singing, and of her shoe in the ice below the waterfall where he saved her.

When the master joins them it is hinted that he is a gangster who has sought out this writer in particular to record his story. As the story begins, we learn that the 'master' was once himself a servant named Bangja, who served the aristocratic scholar Lee Mong-ryong. Throughout the movie, the scene switches between the 'present' Bang providing the narration, and the flashback events of his past. In his capacity as a servant Bangja shares his rooms with Mr. Ma, a notorious womanizer and self-stylized Lothario. Bang escorts his master  to an evening out at the local pleasure house, where they are witness to a performance by the madam's daughter Chunhyang. While trying to arrange a meeting between Chunhyang and his rather clumsy and socially awkward master, Bang defends Mong-ryong from a larger, disgruntled patron and inadvertently impresses both Chunhyang and her maidservant Hyangdan. Mr. Ma begins to coach the simple, honest Bangja in the ways of seducing women, which Bang uses to secure a picnic outing for Mong-ryong with Chunhyang through Hyangdan. During the excursion, Bangja so astounds the ladies by cooking meat to perfection, recovering Chunhyang's slipper from the waterfall pool, and carrying her on his back after she injured her ankle, that a love triangle rapidly begins to form between the two women and Bangja, much to the consternation of Mong-ryong, though he boasts that he is slowly luring Chunhyang to him by playing hard to get. While his master continues to study, Bangja attempts to court Chunhyang. Mr. Ma continues to provide instruction to Bangja, assuaging his concerns when he thinks his master may have slept with her, and pushing him to seize upon spending the night with her before his master can. Though Bangja's seduction is clumsy and his approach very tentative, Chunhyang begins to fall for him and makes love to him on several occasions. Due to his low social-standing, however, she seeks to marry Mong-ryong and enlists Bangja's help in order to make this plan a reality. When Mong-ryong is called away to Seoul to finish studying and take his exam he asks Bangja to recover a written promise he gave Chunhyang about marrying her. She catches Bangja as he tries to steal the paper, and switches it for a confession letter she wrote and got him to sign the night the two of them first had sex. Mong-ryong reads the letter and dismisses Bangja from his service for having deceived him. Three years pass, and Bangja and Chunhyang grow closer and continue to love each other while Bangja becomes the servant of Chunhyang's house and runs errands for a local strong man. However, Chunhyang begins to take after her mother and grows increasingly manipulative despite her burgeoning love for Bangja. In Seoul, Mong-ryong takes his exams and becomes a Royal Inspector. After insulting the court eunuchs however, he is accorded a lowly position in his home town, subservient to the new governor. Mong-ryong finds Hyangdan has become the madam of her own house and runs a successful business. She sleeps with Mong-ryong and asks him if she is not more desirable and pleasing than Chunhyang, but expresses remorse that Bangja chose Chunhyang over her. Mong-ryong discusses women with his magistrate and later returns to Chunhyang's house. Mong-ryong goes for a walk with Chunhyang, and though it is not revealed what the two discussed, Chunhyang returns with a pleased expression and an expectation of seeing Mong-ryong again. The magistrate visits Chunhyang's house and after a confrontation with his own clerks and then Bangja, is greeted by a beautiful, but uncooperative Chunhyang who refuses to sit and pour his drinks because she is not a gisaeng. Enraged by her arrogance, the governor beats Bangja when he attempts to interfere, and has Chunhyang imprisoned. Bangja goes to Mong-ryong and implores his old master to help save her life. Later, during a celebration, the magistrate is seen in a back room attempting to sexually excite Chunhyang because Mong-ryong had told him that she would only bow to his wishes and fulfill his desires if he were violent with her. Bangja causes a commotion to get the magistrate to release her, but is saved from being beaten by the guards when Mong-ryong arrives with a large contingent of guards. Mong-ryong arrests the magistrate and has Chunhyang whipped for her insolence until Bangja interferes, claiming that she has a husband whom she was remaining faithful to. Chunhyang stabs herself with a small blade, saying to Mong-ryong  that she wanted news of her death taken to Master Lee Mong-ryong. Bangja is visited in his cell, first by Mr. Ma, who warns him to never beg a woman to stay, then by Chunhyang, who reveals that she and Mong-ryong planned the whole event after he returned from his exams. For the first time, Bangja confesses his love to Chunhyang, who leaves him. Distraught by these event, she then tells Mong-ryong that she will not leave without Bangja, and so the three of them depart the city together. When the trio stop at the waterfall where they had their first excursion years before, Mong-ryong pushes Chunhyang down the falls and she is seen face-down in the water. Bangja dives in to save her and runs away, carrying her on his back as he did when she injured her ankle. The 'present' Bangja tells the writer that he ran from Mong-ryong and his agents for a long time after those events. The last thing he does to bring the story to close is bring the writer to the back of his warehouse to see Chunhyang who survived the fall, but was left with brain damage and has 'become a child'. The writer declares that Bangja is an amazing man and will make him the hero of a wonderful story about a servant's love, but Bangja insists that the story be told with her fabricated fidelity being the truth, and Chunhyang living happily ever after with a Lee Mong-ryong who loved her and returned for her. When asked why, he says it was because it was something she never got to have, and he is happy with being the hero in his heart. Bangja requests one scene be written to demonstrate the love between the two characters, which he demonstrates by carrying Chunhyang around the room on his back and singing a variation of the song from the pansori Chunhyangga while she smiles lovingly and snow flakes slowly fall on them from the open roof.

She escapes with her life, but when she reaches adulthood, she feels compelled to return to the island, bringing her daughter and nanny with her. Once there, she goes to stay with her uncle who lives on the island. She soon discovers that the natives, who had been using her for voodoo rituals when she was a child, now treat her as a voodoo goddess. In this role, she begins leading their rituals. Any attempt to fight Juanita's influence or to remove her from her position is met with violent force. One person is found dead in a lava pit, while another is found hung. At one point, Juanita is so overcome by the voodoo curse that she offers her daughter up for sacrifice. Juanita's businessman husband, Stephen, follows her to the island and attempts to travel into the jungle to rescue her, but finds her taking part in a sacrifice of an innocent woman. Although he shoots the high priest of the tribe, Juanita completes the sacrifice herself. Their high priest injured, the natives now plan to murder all of the white people on the island. Stephen takes his daughter and two others into the fortified section of a plantation house. The natives succeed in capturing Stephen and his secretary, Gail, but they eventually rescued. In the end, Stephen shoots and kills Juanita just as she is about to sacrifice her own daughter.

As events progress, the documentary comes to revolve around the psychological impact of the attack on a chronically unemployed man in his early 30s , and the pattern of paranormal activity which seems to follow him about. Eventually, the man decides that the initial attack was an act of God, as well as a ceremony intended to both honor God, and open a portal to another dimension. He believes the attacker from the opening scene now resides in this other dimension, as he was seen almost immediately jumping off a nearby cliff, but his body was mysteriously never found. After a series of encounters with huge, flying, apparently telepathic, and quite disturbing-looking, unEarthly entities of a possibly extraterrestrial or other-dimensional nature, he comes to the conclusion that he has a God-given ""duty"" to perform a similarly violent ""ceremony,"" which will enable him to make his journey into this other realm. After an encounter where the film director also witnesses the existence of these same beings, he reluctantly agrees to document the events. The ceremony is to take the form of a suicide bombing of a crowded Tokyo intersection. The bombing takes place, and 108 people are killed. Oddly, no trace of the body of the man wearing the suicide vest is ever located, while the director is convicted as an accomplice, and sentenced to 21 years in prison. Upon his release from prison, now a man in his advanced middle age, he discovers both a video camera, and a 100-yen coin, both of which the man said he would send back to him from the other dimension, in the event he made a successful sojourn to it. The video camera includes a cassette showing the man's final moments on Earth, as well as his apparently successful transition into the other dimension. This dimension appears to be a realm of horrific lunacy and monstrous suffering, and is otherwise of a pseudo-Lovecraftian nature. The man pronounces it ""Hell,"" and in terrified screams, he begs the director to help him, as other persons in obvious torment float in the space around him, and gigantic creatures with an appearance similar to jellyfish, seem to malevolently drift in their midst."

The FAA has received threats that they had better allow this concert to take place. Erica Black Monika Schnarre is a news anchor who is on the airplane with her cameraman Ethan , covering the concert.

Later when Craven is backstage at the first class toilet, an unknown person corners him and assumes his personality. The anonymous person then kills Craven's manager.

Kate places a call and tells fellow agent Frank Garner and his partner Dave Barrett to check it out. Garner and Barrett head to the offices of Z-Web-TV, the company that's broadcasting the concert and it is the same company that Erica works for, and the company is run by Benny Mitchell. When Barrett calls the FAA tower in San Diego and talks to Mr. Stopnow, the head of the tower and his staff, an explosion splinters the tower, killing everyone in there.

They then find more information that Simon is a member of a Satanic Cult called Guardians of the Gateway, who see themselves as the vanguard of the Antichrist who will rule the next millennium. He learns that Simon was previously suspected of murder and charged with 5 counts of Arson with all of the charges dropped due to insufficient evidence. The plane strays off its normal flight path, and is heading toward Stull, Kansas, because there is a small church there that Simon and his accomplices from the cult plan to crash the airplane in, because they believe that Satan will be released by the crash. Nick checks the internet and finds research that when the Pope visited Colorado in 1996, he refused to fly over Eastern Kansas, because this part of Kansas is said to be one of the most unholiest places in the world. It turns out that Erica, who is a high-ranking member of Guardians of the Gateway is the mastermind. Erica organized the whole plan to take the airplane hostage, and the co-pilot, MacIntosh’s  assignment is to crash the airplane into the church. After using the computer to talk to Kate and Nick, Craven manages to free himself and as he is about to leave, Simon enters and the two converse. A fight follows and Craven knocks Simon unconscious. He gets out of the hold, and heads to the auditorium wherein backstage, he finds Erica whom he engages in a hand to hand combat where he disarms her of a gun and knocks her to the electric chair prop which he wires, killing her. He then sees his guitarist, Damen, dead. He goes to the cockpit and finds MacIntosh, who tells him his plan to crash the plane and commits suicide. Realizing that no pilot is left to fly the plane, Craven takes the controls. The fans and the two remaining band members are in despair in the economy class cabin as Craven is guided by the Kansas City International Airport control tower along with Nick and Kate to land the plane. Simon enters the cockpit again and intervenes. Craven engages him in a hand to hand combat while the plane goes into a dive. The two land in the main cabin where Simon is about to stab Craven but Craven manages to disarm him by using a fire extinguisher and subdue him by locking him in the first class toilet and blocks the door with a service trolley. The flight reaches Kansas in a stormy weather and Craven lands the plane safely at Kansas City International Airport. Everyone in the plane applauds. Nick and Kate, the Z-Web-TV, FBI, and Kansas Airport controllers also celebrate. Nick is apprehended and the FBI agents are congratulated.

Fenyu, a young widow who's just arrived from Northeast China  where the Japanese are making incursions, is staying at the country home of Madam Du, her grand-aunt. At a glitzy fund-raiser for refugees thrown by Hudong Bank chairwoman Mo Jieyu  at Yifan's nightclub, Jieyu, an old friend of Yifan who's never succumbed to his advances, asks him to rob Beibei , the 16-year-old fiancee of tycoon Jin Zhihuan , of her virginity. Jieyu wants revenge on Jin, for publicly dumping her in favor of a schoolgirl. Yifan turns down Jieyu's request, partly because he has another quarry in his sights—the quiet and retiring Fenyu. Sensing an opportunity for some sport, Jieyu makes Yifan a wager: if he can seduce Fenyu without falling in love, she will finally agree to sleep with him; if he fails, he will sign over a valuable piece of land to her. Yifan accepts the challenge, but finds the virtuous Fenyu apparently immune to his charms. Meanwhile, Jieyu employs a different strategy to get her revenge on Jin, encouraging an attraction between Beibei and her young drawing teacher, college student Dai Wenzhou . Despite Jieyu's strenuous efforts, the relationship is never consummated; but when she finds out about it, Beibei's mother, Mrs. Zhu , forbids her daughter to see Wenzhou anymore. With time running out, Jieyu suggests to Mrs. Zhu that Beibei should spend some quiet time at Madam Du's estate—and secretly arranges for Yifan to be there, to ""comfort"" Beibei. Mission finally accomplished, Yifan refocuses on seducing Fenyu, but finds himself in deeper emotional waters than he's ever experienced.{{cite web}}"

While the other bears flee to the safety of their cave, Humphrey is left outside and is forced to hide in a nearby cabin instead. Inside the cabin, Humphrey is horrified to learn that it is a hunting lodge, made evident by the many guns and hunting trophies hanging on the walls. As the bear turns to leave, he sees Donald Duck coming down the path toward the cabin carrying a rifle. Humphrey desperately looks for a hiding place inside the cabin. At last he notices a large bear skin rug in front of the fireplace. He quickly rolls up the rug, stows it in an empty trunk, and lays out flat on the floor in the rug's place. Just then, Donald enters and is unaware that his ""rug"" has been replaced, or that it is a real bear. Humphrey nervously endures several uncomfortable and painful experiences, all the while being careful not to let Donald know that he is a real bear. These include hiccups, a burning ember from the fireplace falling on his fur, going through Donald's clothes washer and dryer, and being mowed with a reel mower among other things. Off screen Humphrey spends the rest of hunting season in Donald's cabin carrying on his rug masquerade. When hunting season is over, Donald finally leaves and Humphrey breaths a sigh of relief. But just then Humphrey hears a sound from the trunk in the corner. Humphrey learns, much to his chagrin, that the bearskin rug which he had rolled up and stowed earlier was actually another bear who had also masqueraded as a rug.

In this, he goes around to buy one. On his way, he found a tiger sleeping on the ground. Not wishing to spend money on a real pole, Oswald finds the tiger's tail a good substitute. The rabbit then picks up a saw and cuts the tail off the big cat. Oswald returns to the location of his shop, and stucks the tail on the street just in front. In no time, customers began coming inside. The first one was a bloodhound who came for a haircut despite not having too much hair. After receiving the service, the bloodhound attempts to leave without paying. This patron, however, was grabbed by the cash register which appears to have a mind of its own and shakes every cent it could get. Next to come in is a small fuzzy spaniel. All Oswald wanted was to trim the length of its hairs. As a mistake, he shaves too much on the little dog's rear, making it bald in that area. Nevertheless, the spaniel showed little emotion, and therefore leaves the shop quietly. The third visitor was a rat who doesn't seem to need any service. However, Oswald takes off the rat's nose and puts in a lightbulb. To the rat's amusement, the rabbit lighted up the bulb by inserting the rodent's tail into a socket. The last client was a hippo who wanted a shave. Although, the hippo's beard keeps growing back quickly, Oswald completes the task in three different methods. Things were going well for Oswald until the tiger, which awakened already, walks into the shop. The tiger was pretty annoyed about what it lost earlier and is seeking vengeance. When the rabbit tries to flee, the big cat nabs and swallows him, although Oswald was able to crawl his way out. Understanding the tiger's disgruntlement, Oswald finally picks up the tail and puts it back on the striped beast. The tiger was then overjoyed and runs off peacefully, no longer wanting to wreak havoc. Relieved of his trouble as well as feeling happy for the big cat, Oswald simply laughs.

Dimly  arrives back at the village with Ellie , Tom , and Peeps . By now it is almost spring. Back at the Snow Queen's palace, the three trolls, Eric , Baggy  and Wardrobe  try to decide what to take with them, so when Dimly returns, he takes Freda  back to the flying school and will return for the trolls. However, Freda loses a small object resembling the head of a reindeer, which Wardrobe takes. As the trolls try to figure out where to go, the Snow Queen's bats take her magic staff and place it in her frozen hand, unfreezing and setting her free moments after Dimly returns. While the trolls are loading many bags and suitcases onto Dimly's back, the Snow Queen confronts them and Eric tells her that Ellie and Tom escaped . The Snow Queen decides to kidnap Dimly so Ellie will come to her and she can get her revenge. She moves with Dimly and the trolls to the South Pole, as it is now too warm in the North Pole. During the trip, Eric gets tired of Wardrobe playing with the reindeer head object, so he throws it away, where Peeps finds it. The Snow Queen contacts Ellie and tells her that she has kidnapped Dimly. Ellie doesn't know where the Snow Queen is now, so Peeps takes her to Brenda , a bird that is said to know everything, however she thinks two plus two equals five. She also can't take off from the ground, and must run off a cliff before flying. Meanwhile, the Snow Queen reaches her palace, set on a frozen volcano in the South Pole, and locks Dimly away in a cell next to her ferocious reindeer, which attempt to break into his cell and eat him. Brenda takes Ellie and Peeps toward the South Pole. They stop at a restaurant for food, where the proprietor  and her minions capture Brenda and try to cook her to serve as food. Ellie and Peeps stop them, however, and escape, resulting in the wall of their restaurant falling on top of everyone except the proprietor, as she is directly underneath the window. The Snow Queen begins construction on something that the trolls fear might be another mirror, but is really the Iceosaurus, an ice pterodactyl with eye lasers that can freeze anything. This is her final part of her plan of revenge. Meanwhile, at nighttime, Ellie falls asleep and she and Peeps fall off Brenda and into the ocean, where they are picked up by a humanoid walrus, Clive , and his partner, Rowena , on a ship called the S.S. Quagmire. When Ellie and Peeps describe how they are on their way to the Snow Queen's palace, they realize that she set the whole thing up to lure Ellie there and get revenge. Clive and Rowena are revealed to be bounty hunters, and decide to give Ellie to the Snow Queen for a big reward, and imprison her and Peeps inside an old cage tied to the mast. When Brenda realizes that they have fallen off, she comes back and rescues them, leaving Clive and Rowena to argue and fight over whose fault it is that Ellie escaped. Brenda, Ellie, and Peeps arrive at the South Pole, but the Iceosaurus freezes Brenda, with Ellie and Peeps still trapped inside the cage. They discover the reindeer head object to be a sort of magic talisman. After they see a vision of Freda inside it, it turns into a wrench that Ellie uses to unlock the cage. Then it turns into a salt shaker which Ellie uses to unfreeze Brenda. Brenda separates from Ellie to find a high place to take off. Ellie and Peeps encounter Pearl  and Elspeth , two humanoid penguins who clean the palace for the Snow Queen, and Ellie traps them inside a bubble using the device. They find Dimly and release him from his cell by turning the device into a key, and locking the Snow Queen's reindeer inside. They attempt to escape, but Dimly is too weak to fly at the moment. The Snow Queen and the Iceosaurus attack them, but Freda's device turns into a kind of shield that Ellie uses to deflect the ice beams the Snow Queen shoots at her, eventually causing one to hit the Iceosaurus, which falls and crashes into the ground, causing a massive volcanic eruption. Brenda escapes the flood of lava and gets Ellie, Peeps, and Dimly to safety, while the panicked Snow Queen attempts to flee on feet, but is unable to escape her crumbling palace and falls down into the lava. As Brenda takes Ellie, Peeps, and Dimly back home, Eric, Baggy, Wardrobe, Pearl, and Elspeth watch as the Snow Queen's castle is destroyed, and walk off once the eruption is over. The final scene shows the Snow Queen emerging and drifting through the river of molten magma, her body intact but now either encased in or turned to stone along with her staff . Her eyes glow onimously before the credits roll, indicating that she is still alive and might possibly one day return once again.

After performing Black encounters Sister and Sparkle backstage, attempting to flirt with Sister, but instead of accepting his advances, teases him by slitting the side of her mini-dress above the thigh, before walking on stage. Sister, being the sultry and sexy sister, does a solo performance of a song that Sparkle wrote titled ""Yes I Do"" that grabs all the men's attention, while Sparkle looks on proudly from in front of the stage. Stix spots Sister and Sparkle, and wants to talk to them, as they're rushing out, but she and Sister leave the club and rush home. As Sister and Sparkle arrive home, their middle sister 24 year old Delores/Dee  opens the door and they sneak upstairs to their room to avoid having their mother hear them come in. Emma , the girls' mother, walks into the girls' room and notices Sparkle, Sister and Dee in bed together pretending to be sleep, but Emma being the wise and clever mother she is, sees right through it, and demands that Sister and Sparkle prepare for bed and be ready for church in the morning. The next morning while at church Stix along with his older cousin Levi  spot Sister, Dee, and Sparkle sitting in the choir. Levi tells Stix that Sister, Dee, and Sparkle are siblings with equal musical talent, and Stix is interested in meeting Sparkle. After church Stix and Sparkle meet and talk for a while, as Emma notices and looks on disapprovingly. Ms. Waters  Emma's long time best friend points out that Emma's oldest daughter Sister is almost 30, and due to a bad situation in New York City was forced to move back to Detroit to live with Emma. Later that night Emma hosts a Bible study at her home in which both Levi and Stix are present, however Levi takes the time to make a date with Sister who is uninterested and not participating in her mother's Bible study. After Emma and everyone leave the house, Stix secretly stays behind and notices Sparkle playing an original song that she wrote on a piano. Stix tries to encourage Sparkle to sing. A few nights later Stix comes to Sparkle's home to take her on a date at a nightclub. On the way home while sitting in front of Sparkle's home Stix tries again to encourage Sparkle to pursue a music career and tries to convince her to form a group with her sisters. Sparkle tells Stix that her mother was a former singer, but almost died pursuing her dream. One day after church Stix tries to convince Dee and Sister to form a music group with Sparkle and Sparkle becomes angry feeling that Stix had used her to speak with Dee and Sister about his plan. Dee explains that she will take part in order to make enough money for medical school, then will quit, while Sister is undecided as she will be starting a new job working at a department store. While at Emma's boutique, Ms. Waters shows Sparkle old photos of Emma with Sparkle's father and photos of Emma with Dee's father, explaining how different Emma was when she was with Sparkle and Sister's father. Sparkle leaves and goes to a record store where she sees Stix again. The two make up, and arrange a way for Sparkle to convince her big sisters to join in. While on a date, Sister and Levi are having a good evening at a local cafe, and are really starting to feel something for one another. Levi expresses his love to Sister, and hands her a small ring box which only contains a picture of a ring, as Levi promises to one day give Sister a real engagement ring once he could afford it, touching Sister's heart. Moments later comedian Satin Struthers  comes into the diner with his entourage, noticing Sister and Levi and begins to insult Levi for not being able to afford a real ring to give Sister. Satin has an immediate attraction to Sistr, and photographs her as she exits the diner with Levi. After receiving her first paycheck from her new job which only amounts to $96, Sister is convinced by Dee and Sparkle that if they enter this local talent show they could win hundreds of dollars, which would finally help Sister move out of Emma's home. Levi picks the sisters up, and drive them to the club where Stix is waiting for them, and they watch as another girl group  perform their song, ""Running."" Sister, at the last minute, changes their practice, and tells her sisters to follow her lead, and together give a show like no other.

Satin makes insulting and rude remarks at the dinner and Emma makes her dislike for him known to everyone at the table. In response Sister lashes out at Emma criticizing her for having her as a teen then forcing Sister to raise Sparkle and Dee as Emma was passed out drunk occasionally and trying to pursue a music career. Emma responds that Sister isn't telling the whole story, and tells her that if she leaves with Satin she is never to come back. Sister packs her bags and leaves with Satin. Dee, Sparkle and a visibly high Sister rehearse for a performance at Satin and Sister's home, until Satin comes into the room and interrupts wanting Dee and Sparkle to leave. The girls are invited to open for Aretha Franklin on a television show, and while Dee and Sparkle get ready, Sister walks in with a black eye and bruises. Sparkle and Dee realize that Satin has been beating Sister, and has gotten her hooked on cocaine causing a fight to break out between the three. Sister then adds her makeup, and gets high telling her sisters: ""Sister can't fly on one wing."" That evening, Sparkle, Sister and Dee perform a stunning, sexy, version of ""Something He Can Feel"", when Emma happens to wake up at home and catches a glimpse of their performance on television. She becomes both shocked and angry that her girls have been singing outside the church against her wishes.

Emma gives Sparkle an ultimatum that if she wants to continue living with her she must give up pursuing a music career. At a club Satin is performing for his first all-black audience, but his jokes are trite, pandering, and ill received. Levi who is sitting in the audience with a new woman begins to mock him, receiving more laughs from the audience than Satin, prompting an angered and annoyed Satin to attack Levi.

This is hard enough for any child, but Mir has to face this challenge in modern Afghanistan. In sum, this is a unique portrayal of life, full of humour, full of poignancy, in today’s Afghanistan. The film tracks the life ten years life of Mir, from a naive 9-year-old to fully grown adult in one of the toughest places on earth Afghanistan. The film begins in the year 2002, just after the fall of Taliban when Mir, at that time, was living in a care by the recently destroyed Buddhas of Bamyan. After a year in Bamyan, Mir's family moves back to their home in a small and remote village up north. The film covers the day-to-day lives of Mir and his family. As days pass, Mir changes, like any boy growing up. He starts understanding the world and thus a little less happy. He begins the real life by working hard at the village school and intends to become a teacher. After school, he give a hand to family members and grows wheat in the mountains. He and his father always talk about how good should he be doing in school and how much time should he spend working. As the only son of an ailing father, it becomes clear that there is increasing call for the young boy to help support what is an extremely poor family. As the film progresses, Mir turns his attention, however, from horses and donkeys and helping the family to bikes, motorbikes and having fun. His ambition to one day be a teacher or indeed president of Afghanistan changes; now he simply hopes not be killed in the fighting. The film also shows how is the new Afghanistan changes after the fall of Taliban.

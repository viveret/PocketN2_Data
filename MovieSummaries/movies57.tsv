Though Kip's fiancee, Deb  begs them to stay in the small Texas town of Edenton, the three ranch owners vow vengeance on the Cottrell and decide to head south to find him. When they get to Brownsville, Texas, Lee decides to join the Confederate Army, while Kip and Charlie attempt to rebuild Three Bell ranch. Before they do, however, they take on offer from an attractive local lounge singer, Rouge de Lisle , to transport a box of furniture for fifty dollars. It turns out, however, that the box is instead filled with an illegal shipment of firearms and Kip is subsequently arrested. Before he is punished, however, he is freed and is picked up by Rouge, who offers him a job gun-running for the Confederacy. He accepts the offer, hoping to get enough money smuggling to rebuild the ranch. The trio then hires a group of gunmen, one of which is Slim Hansen, who used to work for Cottrell, and heads to Matamoros, Mexico to pick up a shipment of guns for the Confederacy. As they attempt to cross the border, they run into Cottrell and his gang. In the ensuing gunfight, Kip and Charlie are saved by a company of Confederate soldiers led by Lee, one of which is Lee. The three return to Edenton, where Kip's fiancee again attempts to convince him to stay. Kip is determined, however, to get enough money to restart his farm and instead continues to smuggle guns. When Brownsville is finally captured by rebel soldiers, the three must decide what the next course of action is. Lee continues to fight with the Confederate army, Kip wants to restore Three Bell ranch, and Charlie, more interested in the money, opts to continue smuggling guns. When Deborah refuses to leave her duties as a nurse to join him at the ranch, Kip decides to go with Charlie and return to smuggling. This pleases Rouge, who has fallen in love with Kip. As they near the border, they get word that Cottrell has threatened to kill Charlie and Kip if they return to Matamoros. At Slim's suggestion, they decide to steal the shipment of guns before it even reaches Mexico. The men dress up as Union soldiers in order to steal the guns, but then run into Confederate soldiers who confuse them for the enemy and open fire. Lee, who suspects that Kip and Charlie are behind the attack, breaks off all connections with his two former friends. When Cottrell kills one of Kip's men, Kip resolves that he must kill him. Before he can, however, Slim warns Cottrell, who ambushes Kip. Kip avoids the ambush, but Cottrell is killed by Slim before he is able to tell Kip about Slim's treachery. When Kip returns to Edenton, he finds out that his fiancee has fallen for Lee. Realizing that he has lost both of his closest friends and his fiancee, he leaves with Rouge to Matamoros. After the war is over, Lee joins the Texas Rangers. While serving in Brownsville, he is threatened by his former friend, Charlie. Hoping to resolve the situation, Deb goes to Matamoros to ask Kip for help. With the help of Rouge, Deb convinces Kip to go to Brownsville. Kip gets there just in time to stop the fight, but Charlie is shot by the treacherous Slim. With Charlie dying in his arms, Kip promises Charlie that he will rebuild the Three Bell ranch.

When Nita's boyfriend, importer Phillip Corey , scoffs at her predictions, she informs him that he himself will die within 48 hours. Corey is later found dead in his San Francisco shop, an apparent suicide. Police Inspector Jim C. Gregg  is certain it is a homicide and has Sergeant Kelly  bring Mei Lei in for questioning. She convinces him she is innocent and, after demonstrating her astrological powers by telling both skeptical policemen about themselves based solely on their birth dates, proceeds to help them solve the case and two subsequent, related killings. Police forensic scientist Dr. Merton , however, remains firmly scornful of Mei Lei's unscientific methods. When Corey's Chinese business partner Frederick Gow  shows up at the police station, he recognizes Juggler Barrows , who has been brought in for questioning about an unrelated crime. He pretends to cough and uses a handkerchief to conceal his face from Barrows as he enters Gregg's office. There, he announces that he wants to recover certain business letters from Corey's safe. Mei Lei becomes suspicious. When the letters Gow wanted are later examined, Mei Lei discovers a coded message that indicates Corey and Gow were involved in drug smuggling. Corey was engaged to Doris Kane , though she herself was not attracted to the man, preferring instead crack shot Larry Camp . Under questioning, Kane later reluctantly reveals that Corey had blackmailed her mother into pressuring her to accept the arrangement. She also acknowledges that she went to Corey's home the night he was killed to try to persuade him to break the engagement. She was followed by Camp, who then quarreled with the victim. A shot was fired, but Camp claims that Corey fired at him. Corey's valet, Shields  is also a suspect. Meanwhile, Gow runs into Juggler Barrows.

One day, while Ned is selling at a local market, a police officer asks where he can buy cannabis. Ned, skeptical at first, is moved by the officer's professed desperation due to having a stressful week. Feeling sympathetic, Ned gives him a rhubarb and a bag of marijuana for free. Insisting on paying, the officer coaxes Ned into charging him twenty dollars. Ned is then arrested on a charge of selling drugs. Ned has three sisters. Miranda  is a journalist for Vanity Fair trying to get her first major article published. Though she has trouble finding a man to keep her interest, she and a neighbor, Jeremy ([[Adam Scott  have hidden feelings for each other, but would rather be good friends. Natalie  is a young, independent, bisexual hipster living with her girlfriend, Cindy  and 5 other roommates, suggesting a very communal type apartment. Her love for Cindy conflicts with her fear of commitment, which she hides even around Cindy. Liz , the oldest, is married to Dylan , a documentary filmmaker. Their marriage is failing as Dylan shows no sexual or emotional interest in Liz. They also have strict control over their son River, which leaves him unhappy and unable to express himself. When Ned is released from prison early due to his model behavior, he returns home to his girl and his dog . He finds that she is living with Billy , and no longer wishes to continue their relationship. Disappointed, Ned desires to continue working at the farm, but Janet will not let him. With nowhere else to go, he asks Billy for a ride into town – after saying goodbye to the dog . During the ride, Billy tells Ned that if he can scrape together $1000 , Janet might let him stay in the goat barn for rent on the farm. Ned makes this his goal and heads to his mother's house for a family dinner. At dinner, the family is happy to see Ned but not so happy to be around each other. They are barely into dinner when all the girls decide to leave, which disappoints Ned, who is excited to see everyone. Before leaving, Liz tells Ned that her door is always open to him. That night, Ned's mom tells him she's glad he's home and that the next day, they will go into town together. A few days later, Ned meets with his parole officer, Omar, who tells Ned that he must report to his office every 3 weeks. When Omar asks Ned a few questions on how he is avoiding trouble, Ned struggles to come up with an answer, electing to think more on it for next time. This gives Ned the impression that he and Omar have a therapy-like relationship. While talking to Miranda on the phone, Liz is surprised to see Ned randomly show up on her doorstep, asking if he can stay with her. He is put in River's room and told that he must help around the house. For money, Ned will work with Dylan on his newest documentary about a Russian ballerina named Tatiana. Ned takes River to his dance lesson the next day, but sees River looking into the room of boys doing karate and sighing. That night, Ned shows River The Pink Panther movie to cheer him up. River says that he has never seen it because his parents don't want him to be violent. Ned decides to play karate with River, but is chastised by Dylan for making noise and taking the computer in River's room. The next day, Ned is with Dylan and talks to Tatiana, who shows him some ballet stretches. When Ned informs him that he told Tatiana that Dylan was married, Dylan starts to show signs of jealousy. The next day, Miranda reluctantly asks Ned to chauffeur while she interviews an important client, Lady Arabella . Miranda hopes to pry into her family and recent scandalous break-up, but is dismayed to learn of an agreement with her lawyer to only ask about charity work. Miranda tries to pretend Ned isn't there, but his friendliness charms Arabella, who takes a liking to Ned . That night, Ned goes with Natalie to a self-help meeting with Natalie's artist friend, Christian. Christian is attracted to Natalie but is dissuaded by her lesbian relationship until Ned informs him that she is bisexual and likes guys too. When the session moves into a sauna-type room, Ned is dehydrated and sent to the hospital. Christian and Natalie take a cab home and end up having sex. The next day, Natalie realizes her mistake and is worried about Cindy. Ned goes back to working with Dylan, but is told to watch the car while Dylan conducts a private interview with Tatiana. Hours go by and Ned is approached by a police officer. At first scared at getting in trouble , Ned is simply informed that the car must be moved out of a tow zone. He runs upstairs to get the keys from Dylan, whom he discovered with Tatiana as they were filming an unnecessary nude scene. Dylan returns to the car and tells Ned the only reason he was naked was to make Tatiana feel more ""comfortable"" while being naked. Ned believes this and they head home. The next night, Ned goes with Miranda to Arabella's benefit dinner, and stays behind to have a conversation with Arabella. Although humored by Ned's story of his incarceration, she is touched when Ned explains that his philosophy on life is to trust people and give them the chance to rise up and do the right thing. She then explains the gossipy part of her life  to Ned, who listens with interest. Dylan expresses to Liz his desire to kick Ned out, but she refuses as he is family. However, Ned accidentally breaks River's fingers by catching them in a door hinge while playing hide-and-seek a few days before River's big interview for enrollment at a prestigious school. Despite his parents trying to guide his answers, River tells the interviewer that he enjoys martial arts, which shocks his parents. When Liz asks how he learned martial arts, River explains that Ned taught him. The interviewer asks about Ned, to which River explains that he just got out of jail for selling drugs to a policeman. Liz then kicks Ned out for ruining River's chance at getting into the school . Ned apologizes, stating he was only trying to help River be himself and that little boys play by fighting. Liz gives Ned money and sends him to Miranda. Miranda fronts Ned the remaining cash he needs to rent out the goat barn and is about to send him there when he accidentally mentions Dylan's nude interview with Tatiana. Miranda is shocked and concludes that Dylan is having an affair and goes to call Natalie when Jeremy arrives and hits it off with Ned due to a common love for sci-fi, including the movie Dune. When Natalie answers, Ned prepares to leave and mentions a personal detail about Arabella that makes Miranda realize that Ned has the info she needs. She forces Ned to tell her the details before she goes, which Ned is ashamed to do since he was trusted. Ned returns to the farm with money but is not allowed to rent the barn. Billy apologizes for forgetting to see if it was cool first. Ned leaves again with a sad goodbye to Willie Nelson. Ned is invited to a party at Natalie's apartment where he asks Cindy, who is a lawyer, about ways to get custody of his dog. Cindy explains that although he has a strong case, litigation would just take time and money. She suggests as an alternative that they work together to steal the dog from Janet. At the party Ned is approached by a young couple who wish to have a group sex encounter with him. Ned begins to have sex with the girl but apologizes when the guy begins to kiss him and kisses the guy on the cheek instead. He explains it's just a little too weird for him. At lunch the next day, Jeremy explains to Ned that he is not homophobic just because he is straight and they decide to find Ned a girl. They spot a girl who is very professional, like Miranda, to which Ned suggests that Jeremy and Miranda obviously love each other. Jeremy explains that it is platonic for him and that Miranda is too bossy for him, though admitting she is beautiful. Ned casually mentions the idea to Miranda, who also denies wanting that. Miranda is hurt to learn what Jeremy had to say about the idea and tells Ned her thoughts on Jeremy. This leads to Jeremy and Miranda, who are moving furniture into her apartment, to bicker until Ned makes things worse by skewing the exact words used by both parties. Jeremy storms out and tries to give Ned a copy of Miranda's article, which Miranda snatches away. Ned goes to see Natalie perform stand-up that night, but is worried when Natalie runs off stage at Christian's arrival. He finds her puking and gets her to admit that she cheated and is now pregnant. He tells her to just be honest with Cindy. The family has dinner again a few days later, resulting in Ned and Cindy playing on a trampoline with River while the sisters stay inside talking. Liz mentions Dylan's distantness which provokes Miranda and Natalie to tell her about the affair. Distraught, Liz blames Ned but is scolded by Miranda for doing so. Ned and Cindy decide that next week, when Janet goes to a Dixie Chicks concert, they will have the opportunity to steal Willie Nelson. Inside, Miranda and Natalie try to help Liz feel better by saying they hate Dylan and that she is better off, but it soon turns into an argument between the three about their personal lives. Natalie storms out with Cindy and Liz leaves crying. Ned's mom is happy to have him back, explaining that the girls are too caught up on themselves. Liz confronts Dylan about the affair, and he blames her attempts at pleasing him, deciding to leave her in order to avoid divorce. Miranda takes Ned into work the next day to vouch for the validity of his statements. Ned reads the article and is shocked to see how personal Miranda made it. He refuses to admit that it was all true  in order to spare Arabella the embarrassment to the company's lawyer. However, this means Miranda's article will not get published and she is embarrassed in front of her editor. She kicks Ned out and he stays with Natalie, who lies about having told Cindy about the cheating. The next morning, Cindy drives with Ned to the farm to steal his dog back. They are shocked to see Janet and Billy are home and not at the concert. All is going well until Ned brings up Natalie's infidelity. Cindy angrily calls Natalie from inside the house, which alerts Janet to their presence. Ned tries one last time to persuade Janet while Cindy is heard yelling at Natalie. Janet refuses and Cindy drives away, stranding Ned at the farm. Ned goes to the parole officer the next day for his checkup. Thinking he can confess his feelings and thoughts, Ned tells Omar that the stress of his life was getting to him and he smoked marijuana with a neighbor. Omar, who has grown to like Ned, tells Ned now he must report him. Ned goes home to family dinner and gets dirty looks from all his sisters, who blame him for all the trouble in their lives. While playing charades, the girls guess their answers before River has the fun of acting them out, angering Ned, who is on edge due to potentially having to return to jail. He asks them to play fair, but they merely laugh at him. Ned finally loses his temper and yells at them for their selfishness and for bringing everyone else down. The outburst scares the girls who immediately regret their actions. Omar, visibly upset for having to arrest Ned, arrives with a uniformed officer and takes him into custody. Miranda posts Ned's bail, but Ned refuses to sign his release form, opting to stay in prison rather than be with the girls. They devise a plan to get Willie Nelson from Janet in order to get him to leave. They drive to Janet and ask for Willie Nelson. Janet refuses, saying she loves the dog. Miranda yells and says that no one could love anything as unconditionally as Ned loves everything and that he deserves the dog. Despite her refusal, Billy comes out of the house carrying Willie Nelson, tired of Janet refusing to give Ned his dog. They take Willie Nelson to the prison where he is reunited with Ned, giving him the motivation to leave prison. A few weeks later, Ned is out to lunch with his sisters. Natalie receives a call from Cindy, who wants to go with Natalie to her gynecologist appointments for support. Miranda has patched things up and started a relationship with Jeremy. Liz has decided to start dating again and has started letting River be himself, even enrolling him in a karate class. Ned decides it is time for him to go back to his life the way he likes it, out of the city and in a quiet area. The girls are sad to see him go, but wish him the best. Later on, Ned and Billy have opened up a small homemade candle shop together and seem to do well enough. One day Ned cannot find Willie Nelson, and begins running through town looking for him. He finds Willie playing with another dog in a park area who has also run away from her owner. The owner comes up and Ned finds he has a lot in common with the woman . When he asks her dog's name, the owner replies ""Dolly Parton"" to which Ned says his dog is ""Willie Nelson"" and smiles."

However, she cannot afford the $9,300 procedure. To make matters worse, Scott admits that he has a crush on Amy, only viewing Elizabeth as a friend. Elizabeth attempts to raise money for the surgery by participating in her 7th grade class car wash in provocative clothing and by manipulating parents to give her money for more school supplies and tutoring, but her efforts are not enough. Amy, acting on the growing resentment between them due to her pursuit of Scott and ignoring of school rules, attempts to warn the principal about Elizabeth's embezzlement scheme, but he dismisses her claims as groundless. Elizabeth later learns that the teacher of the class with the highest state test scores will receive a $5,700 bonus. With this knowledge, Elizabeth decides to change her style of teaching, forcing the class to study intensely for the upcoming test. However, the change is too late and insufficient.

However, Scott's peculiar behavior, which was subtly exposed by Russell when Scott would agree with anything even if it's contradictory, disappoints Elizabeth. Elizabeth later gives advice to one of her students  who has an unrequited crush on a superficial girl  in class, which causes her to reflect on how she has been superficial as well. After hearing Elizabeth and Scott having sex, Amy switches Elizabeth's desk with her own to trick the janitor into unlocking Elizabeth's sealed drawer. The evidence Amy finds leads her to suspect Elizabeth cheated on the state exam. Amy informs the principal and gets Carl to testify against her. However, Elizabeth took embarrassing photos of Carl while he was drugged and uses them to blackmail him to say she is innocent. Having noticed her desk was switched, Elizabeth informs the principal that some teachers in the school are doing drugs. When the police bring a sniffer dog to search the school, they find Elizabeth's mini liquor bottles, marijuana and OxyContin pills in Amy's classroom, in Elizabeth's desk. Amy is moved to the worst school in the county by the superintendent. Scott asks Elizabeth to start over, but Elizabeth rejects him in favor of a relationship with Russell.

He searches for his brother, finding him tied up in a cage. He frees him and carries him to his truck. Jesse turns to his brother and says ""you should have saved me?"" before disappearing, leaving Tom confused before heading back to the rest stop. Marilyn and Jared learn from the attendant that to put the Driver to rest, they need to burn his eyeballs. But the Driver set a trap for them. When Jared awakes, The Driver claims, using the attendant to talk for him, that Marilyn was unfaithful to Tom and needed to be ""cleansed"". Jared refuses and has his right eye cut out by the Driver.

The film opens at a dance in 1919, establishing the personalities of the four main protagonists and following them through courtship and marriage. While the sisters have remained close to one another over the years, both their characters and the paths down which their lives have travelled are very different. Lucy is the most stable of the three, a sensible and practical woman in a happy marriage, whose greatest sadness in life is her inability to have children which she sublimates by lavishing affection on her nephews and nieces. Vera is married with a child but the relationship is humdrum and loveless and she is restless and bored with her dreary home life, indulging her appetite for adventure and excitement through a series of flirtations with other men which sometimes go beyond the bounds of the socially acceptable towards the promiscuous. Charlotte is a cowed, fearful and flinching drudge, suffering severe physical and emotional abuse at the hands of her manipulative, brutal husband Geoffrey , who constantly belittles and humiliates her in front of their three children. The action of the film shifts between the three households, but its main focus is the way in which Lucy and Vera have to look on impotently, unable to do anything to help matters despite their best attempts as Charlotte's treatment by her husband  becomes ever more shocking and she spirals into alcoholism in an attempt to blur her despair. A final attempt by Charlotte to flee Geoffrey ends in tragedy as she is struck and killed by a car. Vera's marriage too crumbles, as her husband finds out about a serious extra-marital relationship in which she is involved, and petitions for divorce. The film ends by showing the four children of Charlotte and Vera being cared for by the childless Lucy.

However, he is contacted by MI7, requesting he returns to service. Johnny returns to MI7's London headquarters  and assigned by new boss ""Pegasus""  to stop a plot to assassinate the Chinese Premier during scheduled talks with the Prime Minister. Johnny also meets with fellow agent Simon Ambrose  and MI7's resident inventor, Patch Quartermain . He is also assigned a junior agent, Colin Tucker . In Hong Kong, English discovers an address that leads him to ex-CIA agent Titus Fisher . Fisher reveals that he is a member of a group of assassins called 'Vortex', who sabotaged English's mission in Mozambique. Vortex holds a secret weapon, which requires three metal keys to unlock, and Fisher reveals one. Fisher is killed by an assassin  dressed as a cleaner, and the key falls into Vortex's hands. English is humiliated in front of the Foreign Secretary and Pegasus by the loss of the key, and assaults Pegasus's mother, mistaking her for the killer cleaner. Kate Sumner , MI7's behavioural psychologist, prompts English to recall the events of his mission in Mozambique, and the identity of the second Vortex operative, Karlenko , a Russian spy. A golf match between Karlenko and English leads to multiple attempts on English's life. However, Karlenko is critically injured by the assassin, and English attempts to fly him to hospital. Before they arrive, Karlenko reveals that Vortex's last agent is a member of MI7, and dies. In a meeting at MI7, it is revealed that talks between Britain and China will continue in a heavily guarded Swiss fortress called 'Le Bastion'. Over dinner, English informs Ambrose that he knows of a mole in MI7. Ambrose prepares to kill English, until it becomes clear that the traitor's identity is unknown. Tucker confronts Ambrose in the bathroom, knowing he is the mole, but English orders him to leave. Ambrose convinces English that Quartermain is the traitor. English entrusts the key to Ambrose, who tells Pegasus that English is the traitor. English confronts Quartermain, and realises that he has been framed. He escapes in a modified wheelchair. English goes to Kate's house, and convinces her that he is not the traitor. Kate, scrutinising footage of the Mozambique mission, realises that the assassin behaved abnormally. They learn that Vortex owns a drug called timoxeline barbebutenol that allows them to control a person for a brief time before they die of heart failure. Ambrose, the only surviving member of Vortex, plans to use the drug to kill the Premier in exchange for 500 million USD. English confronts Tucker and convinces him to help break into 'Le Bastion'. English warns Pegasus of the threat, and drinks the drug instead, rendering him vulnerable to Ambrose's commands. Ambrose orders English to kill the Premier using a pistol disguised as a tube of lipstick. English tries to resist the effects of the drug , and engages in a fight with himself while Tucker attempts to interrupt communication between Ambrose and English. Tucker disrupts the frequency, replacing it with radio station, resulting in English beginning to dance. Ambrose reasserts his command, revealing himself in the process. English resists, shooting at Ambrose, who escapes. The effects of the drug wear off and English seemingly dies of heart-failure, before being revived by Kate, who kisses him on the lips, making his heart rate boost. English pursues Ambrose, parachuting from the building and hijacking a snow-mobile. English reaches Ambrose, who is in a gondola lift. The two fight, with English falling out of the car.

A flock of snowy owls soon arrive for the baskets, bringing a final shipment order for Fairy Mary  with them. Tinker Bell  watches as the birds headed off toward the Winter Woods in awe and curiosity. Later that day, Tinker Bell volunteers to help Fawn  take animals to the Winter Woods to hibernate, but Fawn warns Tinker Bell that they could only bring animals to the border, and they aren't allowed to go into the Winter Woods. With Fawn distracted by a sleeping marmot, Tinker Bell jumps across the border into the Winter Woods. Tink gazes in wonder at the beautiful wintry landscape, enchanted by the delicate snowflakes falling around her, and the strange colors her wings create. The moment ends when Fawn yanks Tinker Bell back into the Autumn Woods. Touching Tink's wings, Fawn gasps at their cold temperature and rushes her off to the fairy hospital. A healing-talent fairy  examines Tink's wings and warms them to normal temperature. Tink remains curious about the sparkles and colors her wings made in the Winter Woods. Tink flies off to the Book Nook, where she finds a wing-shaped book, but unfortunately, it's pages are all chewed through. A fairy ([[Thomas Lennon  tells Tink that the author of the book, the Keeper, might be able to help her, but he lives in the Winter Woods. Preparing herself for the Winter Woods, Tink sneaks into the tinkers' workshop and climbs inside one of the snowflake baskets, and flies her way into the Winter Woods. Suddenly, the owl accidentally drops the basket, and Tink crashes into the snow. Realizing her book had been flung from her bag after the landing, she tries to get it back before another fairy finds it. However, Lord Milori , the Lord of Winter, takes the book from Sled . Lord Milori asks Sled to return the book to the Keeper. Tinker Bell follows Sled to the Hall of Winter, upon arriving spotting the Keeper, Dewey . Then another winter fairy rushes into the room and proclaims that her wings are sparkling. Simultaneously, Tinker Bell's wings begin to sparkle, too. A force pulls her toward the winter fairy, who's name is Periwinkle . The girls ask Dewey to explain what was happening to their wings. Bringing Tink and Periwinkle to the giant snowflake, and positioning their wings, the whole chamber becomes filled with images of a baby's first laugh, that split in half: one to the Pixie Dust Tree, and the other to the Winter Woods. Tink and Periwinkle realize that they are fraternal twins. Suddenly, Lord Milori arrives, concerned over Tinker Bell's book, warning Dewey to send any 'warm' fairy back to the Autumn Woods. Dewey tells the girls they can have a little time to visit before Tink has to return home. The two go to Periwinkle's house, where she shows Tink her various items she had collected. Next, they go to the Frost Forest, to introduce Tink to Periwinkle's friends Gliss  and Spike . They continue to spend time together the entire day. That night outside Periwinkle's house, as Tinker Bell builds a fire to stay warm, she realizes that if she can make it warm in the Winter Woods, she can make it cooler at her home. Suddenly, the snow floor melts beneath them, weakened by the fire. After the incident, Dewey tells the girls that Tink has to go home. The girls realize that they might never see each other again, but Tinker Bell comes up with a plan. When the three fairies reach the border, Tinker Bell begins to fake crying while whispering to Periwinkle to meet her at the border tomorrow. When Tinker Bell arrives home, she asks her friends Clank  and Bobble  for help. Hard at work, some of Tink's other friends stop by and learn of Tinker Bell's sister, excited at the prospect of meeting her. The next day, Tinker Bell arrives at the border with Bobble and Clank, pulling along a snow-maker. Now able to keep Periwinkle cold enough, Peri's crosses the border to the 'warm' side of Pixie Hollow. She meets Tinker Bell's friends, Fawn, Iridessa , Rosetta , Silvermist , and Vidia  and continues her tour of the warm side of Pixie Hollow, until Tink noticed Periwinkle's wings wilting. The snow-maker was running out of ice, and there wasn't enough snow to keep Peri cold, so Tink and Periwinkle return to the border. Lord Milori appears and instructs Periwinkle how to fix her wings. Queen Clarion , arrives too, and explains to the girls that they can never see each other again. As the girls go their separate ways, the snow-maker gets knocked into the stream, and creates a snowstorm. Later that day, Queen Clarion tried to make Tinker Bell understand why the rule about not crossing the border was so important. She tells the story of two fairies who fell deeply in love, but were from the different worlds. One of the fairies crossed the border and broke a wing; an injury for which there was no cure. Just as the Queen finishes her sad tale, it begins to snow, causing a commotion. Queen Clarion, Tink, and a group of fairies arrive at the stream to find Clank and Bobble attempting to free the snow-maker. Finally, they succeeded in pushing the machine into the water, but it continues to snow. The seasons become thrown out of balance, and the life of the Pixie Dust Tree comes into question; if it becomes too cold, it will freeze and stop producing pixie dust. Tink then notices that a flower that Periwinkle had planted is still blooming, despite its warm surroundings. Tinker Bell flies straight to the Winter Woods, and asks Gliss and Periwinkle why the flower was still alive. Gliss explains that frost tucks warm air inside,and Periwinkle suggests that they could frost the Pixie Dust Tree before the cold comes. Tinker Bell and the frost fairies fly to the Pixie Dust Tree. They get right to work, but realize that the job would be too big for them to finish in time. Then Tinker Bell spotted Dewey, Lord Milori, and the rest of the frost fairies flying toward them, helping them frost the tree. Afraid the freeze had come too late, the fairies gather anxiously around the Pixie Dust Well, and rejoice when pixie dust then begins to flow again. Tinker Bell realizes that she had broken a wing when she had flown to the Winter Woods, and warns Periwinkle to go back to the Winter Woods before her wing wilt. As the sisters hold hands and say good-bye, an explosion of pure sparkly light bursts from their wings, healing Tink's broken wing. From that day on, warm fairies can cross over the border into the Winter Woods anytime they like. A coat of frost keeps the warm fairie's wings safe while in the cold. Strong and close friendships between warm fairies and winter fairies blossom, just as warm and beautiful as Periwinkle's flower.

While Terry quickly becomes a welcome member of the pipeline crew, Dean cannot take the pace of work and decides to injure himself for the Workers’ compensation money with Tron's help, however he quickly finds that the money offered is much less than he had expected. Flush with money and confidence, Terry starts dating Trish , a waitress at the local strip bar who has slept with every member of the pipeline crew at one time or another. When Terry quickly moves in with Trish, Dean does his best to save his friend from fading into a domestic lifestyle. When layoffs hit the pipeline crew, Terry's fast-spending lifestyle quickly catches up with him, putting heavy strain on his relationship with Trish, who soon reveals she is pregnant. This only makes things worse, as it was revealed in the first film that Terry is infertile, meaning that the father is another member of the pipeline crew. Meanwhile, Dean's latest medical checkup for his Workers' compensation claim reveals that his cancer has returned in more aggressive form, due to his failure to attend a single follow-up treatment over the past five years. Terry, in a rage over an incident that occurred while Dean was drunk, ends their friendship, adding insult to injury. Dean reveals his condition only to Tron, who since being laid off has developed a serious crack habit. Each despondent for his own reason, Dean and Tron form a suicide pact, planning to end their lives the day after Christmas. As Christmas fast approaches, Terry finds out from another member of the pipeline crew that Dean has lost his other testicle due to cancer. Terry rethinks his decision and goes to pick Dean up from a Hobo colony, where he has been living out of his car. Terry welcomes Dean into his home for Christmas. On Christmas Eve, Dean's family arrives, showing him there are things worth living for, and he decides to forego committing suicide, however, Tron shows up at Terry's house, intent on fulfilling the pact. Tron attempts to smother Dean with a pillow, but Dean fights back and ends up in a scuffle with Tron, in which Tron soils himself. Dean's daughter Chaz is awakened by the whole ordeal, and walks into the living room finding Tron dressed in a red suit and a Santa hat. Believing him to be Santa, she gives Tron a hug. The film ends with Dean discovering that his complete lack of testicles has allowed him to sing higher notes than ever before, and he performs as the wedding singer for Terry and Trish. The two leave the reception and are showered by friends and family, including Tron, who also decided not to commit suicide. The film ends with a family photo of Terry, Dean, Trish and the new baby, who bears a striking resemblance to Dean."

After returning home, Matthew finds a tape from right after Tom went missing, a news clip in which Matthew's father, Jake  says, ""I just want, Tom back. Please don't hurt him."" While watching the tape the whispered, eerie voice of Tom says, ""Matthew..."" Later, when Jake returns home, Matthew tells him about what he heard and shows him the tape, hoping that Jake will hear the voice too. However, Jake does not hear the voice and goes into a fit of rage as the wound of losing his son is reopened. Matthew soon meets his new troubled neighbour, Amy Tyler . She does not say much except that she's sorry about Tom, and then leaves. Matthew is then walking along the pavement when he peers in a store window noticing a television with a reel of Missing Child photos. Tom shows up on the screen and Matthew sees the reflection of Tom behind him in the window. He turns around, but Tom is gone. That night at the park, Matthew is smoking with his friend, Simon  whom he tells about hearing Tom's voice. Simon informs him of a phenomenon where people hear dead people's voices on tapes, which Matthew at first thinks nothing of as he still believes Tom is alive. The next day, Matthew records his own voice on a tape hoping to hear Tom when he plays it back. While in the middle of recording, a gang comes up to him, taunting him for being crazy, talking to himself in the park. They smash his recorder and beat him up. When Matthew wakes up, Amy is there, who takes him back home with her. They talk about their own personal issues for a while until Matthew goes home to listen to the tape. He once again hears Tom's voice, though Jake is becoming increasingly concerned for Matthew's mental health. That night Matthew has what will become a recurring dream of being buried alive. In the morning Matthew is visited by a clergymen, Adrian Ballan  who talks to him for a while about Tom. Not really listening, Matthew sees a gaunt looking Tom, out the window.

Simon laughs, not believing him, suggesting he, ""Need to spend a bit more time in the old whack shack, you know what I mean?"" Matthew leaves, irritated and furious that no one believes him. He again meets up with Amy who says that she believes him and recommends he go and talk to a medium she knows. Taking her advice, Matthew finds the medium, Shelley Cartwright  who tells him that perhaps Tom is trying to tell him something. Before Matthew leaves, the medium's daughter, Rebecca  gives him a drawing of a girl. Matthew goes home and Jason Saks  asks him what he thinks about all the recent abductions. Upon asking Jason what he means, Matthew discovers that Simon's younger sister, Sophie  has been recently abducted. Matthew refuses to answer Jason's questions and hurries off to Simon's house. He then realizes that the picture Rebecca gave him, was of Sophie. He shows it to Simon, who tells Matthew that Shelley Cartwright died years ago when her flat burnt down. He then throws Matthew out in a rage. Matthew returns to the medium's house and sees it was burnt down. He confides all of this information to Amy who tells him it does not matter if Tom is alive or not, that Matthew just has to listen to him. After going to his appointment at the hospital, Matthew is chased out of the park by the gang that attacked him earlier and is rescued by Adrian who talks to him again about Tom, and what Matthew is going through.

She takes this prompt decision much to the chagrin of her father, an overbearing taxi driver. In exchange, he forces her to join him at work so she can learn the trade and earn a living. Her reconnection with the so-called ""Family"", the close-knit group of her father's co-workers, is initially uneventful. One of its members is Dani, Paz's childhood sweetheart and a young taxi apprentice about to be discharged from the military service. Upon meeting for the first time in many years, they rekindle their mutual attraction and start dating, much to the apparent satisfaction of Dani's mother Reme—a fellow cabbie who is having a secret affair with Paz's father. Reme's husband is a former taxi driver who, according to the explanations given to Paz, was shot by two drug dealers during a robbery. One of the shots left him paralyzed and the ""Family""'s visits to him in the hospital are a staple in their common social life. Aside from Dani, Velasco and Reme, this group is completed by a shady individual named Calero and a thuggish brute nicknamed ""Niño"" who seems to act as an informal henchman of sorts for the former. Paz realizes Calero is a former cop even before being told so, and their mutual distrust is vivid and ever-increasing throughout the film. From the outset, it is made clear to the audience that the ""Family"" is in fact a neo-fascist death squad whose members use their cabs to abduct non-white, immigrant, LGTB and drug-addicted costumers with murderous intent. There is also some evidence of rudimentary tactics, e.g. using code words for each ""kind"" of victim in order to lure unwitting victims to the killing box. Dani has been recently groomed into the group and partakes in their activities, although it is made apparent to the audience that he does so reluctantly. The ""Family"" seems to be generally successful in its exploits: two murders are shown on-screen, as well as a raid on a Moroccan camp during which Dani accidentally kills a man. The film does show, however, one botched attack during which the victim manages to run away unharmed. It is left unclear whether or not the group is restricted to the core members shown onscreen. It is also left unclear whether the group's activities were prompted by the attack that crippled Dani's father or it was just a casual event that fuelled them further, or whether the version given to Paz was a lie and the attack was a direct result of the group's illegal pursuits. Their activities are spontaneous and seemingly not officially sanctioned, but there are ominous references by Calero to people ""up there"" who know and approve of the group's activities, leaving the door open to speculation on a wider conspiracy. Although initially ignorant of the actions and general demeanour of the ""Family"", Paz gradually finds out the truth through a series of details and coincidences, such as a profusion of fascist and pre-democratic antics and regalia, purportedly intimate family reunions attracting skinheads and other sinister individuals and ending in massive Roman salutes, casual bigoted remarks from her father and Dani  and a disturbing pattern of codenames or ""labels"" directed at different collectivities. Paz's unassuming and long-suffering mother seems increasingly distraught at the prospect of having Dani close to her daughter, and although Paz initially blames this on his general lack of education and ambition, it becomes increasingly clear that her mother knows more than she says about him and the whole group. Once confronted with the evidence, her disgust and adamant disapproval set up a chain of events leading to the climax. The paranoid and increasingly unstable Calero, who saw her as a potential liability to the group from the very beginning, now wishes to silence Paz at all costs. He shoots  her father when he tries to stop him, and confronts her and Dani in the Retiro Park, shooting Dani, and being shot to death by Paz seconds before he is about to finish him off. The camera pans over the park as she walks away with the injured Dani, and credits roll. The fate of the rest of the group is left undisclosed."

Driven to complete the piece by her domineering elder sister Julia , Olwen becomes agitated and despondent, and one night sleepwalks to the edge of a cliff near their home. Julia follows her and shouts her name but Olwen, abruptly awakened, loses her balance and falls to her death on the rocks below. Julia is unable to come to terms with Olwen's death and the guilt of her own role in it, over the years becoming a reclusive, obsessive figure whose main raison d'être is to keep Olwen's memory alive. Olwen's final composition gains her posthumous recognition, and each year on the anniversary of her death it is broadcast on the radio. On the 25th anniversary of Olwen's death, Julia is listening to the broadcast when she hears a frantic knocking at the door and opens it to admit an unknown young woman , who immediately walks up to the piano and begins expertly playing along with the piece on the radio. The young woman claims to have lost her memory and to have no idea of who she is or how she came to chance upon the isolated house, yet she seems to have a familiarity with the surroundings and the history of the Trevelyan family. Struck by her physical resemblance to Olwen, Julia offers her refuge and, also seeing behavioural traits reminiscent of Olwen, becomes convinced that the woman is the reincarnation of her dead sister. A local faith healer Nehemiah , who also claims second sight, becomes involved and it seems increasingly as though history is repeating itself, culminating when the young woman too is found standing precariously on the edge of the cliff from which Olwen fell.

Doctor Del Shaw, an investigator from the British ecological watchdog group nicknamed Doomwatch, is sent to the island of Balfe, to file a report on the effects of a recent oil tanker spill. He becomes fascinated with the mysterious behavioural disorders of the locals who display rudeness and random aggression and a strange genetic prevalence of thick lips and sloping brows. Investigation shows that the villagers have been suffering over a prolonged period from hormonal disorders, which are being caused by leaking drums of growth stimulants that have been dumped offshore. The islanders have been eating contaminated fish and are in turn developing acromegaly, a disorder of excessive hormonal growth, usually the result of family interbreeding, which produces aggression and eventually madness. Rather than seek help from the mainland they hide those who are deformed from any newcomers...

The same day, the police and her sister Elizabeth  find her hanged in her room. The police rule her death as an unmotivated suicide, but Elizabeth refuses to believe this and investigates further. She decides to visit the exclusive academy that Martha attended, The Salem Academy for Women, despite warnings from Martha's roommate, Lucy Dembrow . Under the assumed name of Elizabeth Morgan, she enrolls at the college, where she is welcomed by her classmates Roberta Lockhart , Debbie Jones  and Jody Keller . Elizabeth notes several strange occurrences, but postpones further investigation. Debbie has an outburst in class. The feared headmistress, Mrs. Jessica Williams , is worried about the influence of ""the new girl"". When Lucy commits suicide, Elizabeth resumes her investigation. She becomes intrigued with a painting of Martha in a dungeon-like room. Debbie, who painted it, is terrified of the painting and claims she invented the background, but Elizabeth finds an identical setting in a cellar on campus. When she is accosted by a man with a sharp weapon, Elizabeth flees. The next night, Elizabeth returns to the cellar with Roberta, who is now suspicious as well. They locate a hidden room in which they find the dead body of Debbie, who earlier that evening had tried to leave the campus. Elizabeth suspects that Professor Delacroix  is responsible, considering his odd and mildly sadistic behavior. Elizabeth bursts into his office, finding him in a deranged state with a gun in his hand. He fears something supernatural is stalking him, and he jumps through the window. After running for some time, he ends up mired in a swamp, where he is beaten with sticks by several students including Jody. Meanwhile, the otherwise popular Dr. Joseph Clampett  reveals to Williams that he is responsible for all the murders. He orders the headmistress to evacuate the school. Elizabeth and Roberta are unaware of the evacuation. They discover the body of Delacroix, who has been brutally murdered. Elizabeth and Roberta turn to Williams for help, but she has gone insane. When they are unsuccessful in calling the police, Elizabeth and Roberta go to the cellar to find a gun. Instead they find Clampett leading a satanic cult. His followers  believe that he is Satan incarnate, and Roberta reveals herself as his loyal servant. Elizabeth is able to escape when Clampett sets the school on fire, and she takes Williams with her. The other girls, however, stay behind to sacrifice themselves to their leader. Clampett, who is actually supernatural, survives the fire and is seen outdoors, where he mysteriously vanishes."

She has been separated from her husband Bob  for a while, who is desperate to win back his wife's affection. After being five days overdue, Jane goes into labor. Everything is going well, until she is suddenly sedated by a nurse, Rita Donahue . Hours later, she regains consciousness, and the doctor informs her she went into labor prematurely and had a stillborn. Noticing the amount of drugs that was in her body after the labor, he suspects that she is abusing medicine pills, which he thinks caused the premature birth. Little does Jane know that Rita - with the help of her teenage son Patrick  - stole her baby daughter, and switched records on a stillborn and healthy child to make it appear as if Jane's baby was a stillborn. Rita faked a pregnancy for months to keep her drifting lover Frank  from leaving her. When Frank, who is married to another woman - shows his disappointment that 'their' child is not a boy, Rita responds in anger, and immediately sets out to somehow get a baby boy as well. Sometime later, she announces that she is pregnant again, and poses under the assumed name Elaine Crisp to take care of a pregnant woman who will deliver a boy. When Rita finds out that the woman knows about her true identity, she instead gives labor of a 30-year-old woman named Theresa Richland  in her home, cuts her throat, and steals her baby. Meanwhile, Jane becomes convinced that she did not suffer a miscarriage, but instead of receiving support, her relatives and best friend Sharon  believe that she is addicted to drugs and suffering from a depression, and suggest her to visit a psychiatrist. Even though she is estranging herself from everyone she knows, Jane continues to find out the truth and slowly recollects all the memories of her labor. In the hospital, she runs into Nurse Ramsey , who helped her with her labor before Rita stepped in. Ramsey admits that she remembers that her baby was alive and healthy when she last check up on her, but she is too afraid to support her theories. Therefore, Jane hires attorney Gail Huddle  to sue the hospital, only to find out her case is hopeless since her records have gone missing . Back in the hospital, Detective Knoll  suspect Rita as Theresa's killer, because Theresa's boyfriend Tom Burke  identified her as her midwife. After giving him a false alibi, she instructs Patrick over the phone to give Knoll the same story if he is questioned. Nevertheless, Knoll instructs an examination, during which her doctor concludes that she has had a hysterectomy over ten years ago and cannot give birth to children. Afterwards, Rita admits to the murder of Theresa and having stolen two babies, but refuses to tell who the first baby's mother is. Nonetheless, Knoll locates Jane, and happily reunites her with her daughter.

Even though he has the opportunity to kill her, he tells her ""Soon, Amy, soon"" and then leaves. The police are no longer willing to help her, and although her stepmother Adele  tells her she believes her, she advises her to visit a psychiatrist, Dr. Letterman . To him she admits that her father drowned a year ago during a boating accident. She was supposed to attend him on his trip, but canceled, and has felt guilty ever since. One day, she finds a package in the post with a card that reads ""Soon, Amy, soon"". With Adele, she traces the origin of the package, leading to a florist  who claims that she made the order herself. Adele contacts James Lockwood  to discuss Amy's situation, but she overhears this and runs off to college in anger. There, the mysterious man shows up again and terrifies her, as she tries to escape, until lawyer student David Norland  appears. Returning to psychiatrist Letterman, Amy is told that her subconscious is making up the killer. She believes him, and decides to return to the place where her father died - a cabin in the woods - to face her guilt. Originally, Adele accompanies her, but a sudden meeting with James forces her to leave. During this meeting, James tells her that he heard from Letterman that Amy is suicidal. Considering that she will receive her father's estate when she turns 21 in three months, it would leave them penniless. Adele puts up on act as though she only cares about Amy's well-being, but it later turns out that she set everything up to drive Amy insane, with Letterman posing as the mysterious man. Letterman, meanwhile, has gone to the cabin, and after a struggle, he sedates Amy and puts her on a boat, pushing her into the river. Afterwards, he comforts Adele, who feels somewhat guilty due to her recent bonding with Amy. Shortly later, strange events start to occur to Adele in the mansion, such as locked doors that suddenly open, and a sculpture of Amy that disappears. She becomes convinced that someone is messing with her, but Letterman convinces her that she is imaginating it all. One night, she is determined that she is hearing Amy's cries, until she receives a phone call from James, informing her that Amy's body has been found. The following night, Adele is startled when Amy suddenly appears before her door. Around the same time, Letterman arrives, and Adele, thinking his attempts to enter her room are Amy's, shoots through the door, killing him. It turns out that Amy's death was a set-up from James, David and Amy to eventually scare her into the confession of killing Amy's father. Shortly after Adele's arrest, Amy is happy to celebrate her two months with David. In the final scene, David whispers ""Soon, Amy, soon"". At the end of the movie, Amy wakes up to find out that it was all just a dream...or was it?"

Wondering why he is so afraid, the passengers suddenly see an out-of-control aircraft that crashes into them. Years later, Sara , who has recently received her pilot's license, is planning to fly to a concert with her friends, Sal  and his girlfriend, Sara's best friend Mel , her cousin Cory  and her boyfriend Bruce Parker . While in the air, Bruce's nerves draw ridicule from the others and Sara invites him to take the controls. They hit some turbulence and Bruce loses control, taking them into a steep climb. Sara tries to regain control, but a loose bolt has jammed the elevator. Only able to climb, they fly into a storm and lose radio contact. Sara explains that with the elevator jammed, they will keep climbing until they run out of fuel or reach the aircraft's ceiling. They have less than an hour's worth of fuel left; Bruce has a panic attack and is put to sleep with a choke hold by Sal. In an effort to save fuel, they jettison everything overboard. The only way to unjam the tail is to climb outside and manually remove the obstacle. Cory, who has experience as a climber, volunteers. He has climbing gear with him and a rope for to use as an anchor. Sal wraps the rope around himself and after some difficulty, Cory makes it to the tail and removes the errant bolt. Sal then sees a horrifyingly giant tentacle among the clouds and loses control of the rope. Cory slips and Sal is almost pulled out of the aircraft. Panicking, he cuts the rope and Cory falls, only to be caught by the monster tentacle. When Bruce awakens, he finds he has been tied up and learns Cory is dead, along with a monster outside. Bruce tells Sara that he was in the crash that killed her mother and his parents. Sara tries the radio again and hears a strange noise. Sal recognizes it as the monster that took Cory. Suddenly, the aircraft crashes into the monster's open mouth. Bruce looks at a page of his comic which shows a blond woman being grabbed by tentacles. Immediately, a large tentacle grabs Mel. Bruce starts flicking through the comic book, as if he has discovered something. Sal threatens to kill Bruce for causing Mel's death and tries to throw him out, but Sara intervenes and in the ensuing confusion, Sal falls out the door. Bruce tells Sara he is causing all this; that his mind is recreating the comic book, something that happens when he gets very scared. The creature starts attacking the aircraft, and Sara demands that Bruce prove he is doing it by ending it all. His attempts just make things worse, until Sara kisses him, but is grabbed by the monster. She tells him that if he can do all this, then he can bring his parents back. After a struggle, the monster suddenly disappears and she falls back into the aircraft. As they fly out of the storm, they see another aircraft heading straight for them, carrying Bruce, his parents and Sara's mother. They manage to take control of their aircraft, and don't crash into the other. In the altered past Sara's mother and Bruce's family have arrived at their destination intact. Sara's mother says ""Everybody gets one near miss, right?"", and Bruce's mom asks, ""Do you think they made it?"" to which Sara's mother replies ""I hope so."" The young Sara and Bruce are introduced to one another, holding hands and looking out into the sky."

In the play, Don Juan's fiancee Maria is secretly seeing his brother Don Phillipe. Unbeknownst to the two lovers, Don Juan is watching them from one of the balconies. Horrified by the thought of Maria leaving him for Philippe, he calls upon his Jester servant for help. So that he can pay for a wedding, Juan sends the Fool into town to ask for money from the Mayor , under the false pretense that Juan needs the money to pay off medical bills . When Juan's father learns about his son's true intentions, he gives the Jester two coins so he and Juan can buy some rope to hang themselves with. Outraged by this, Don Juan murders his own father backstage and heads over to the garden where Maria and Philippe were planning to meet. Maria arrives shortly after but is shocked to discover Don Juan there instead of her true love Philippe. Demanding that she return his feelings or face the consequences, he chases after Maria but is stopped by her father, Don Vespis, who now realizes Juan is unfit to marry his daughter and threatens to have him arrested. Don Juan dispatches of Maria's father by cutting his face off, and as he lay dying he swears his ghost will haunt Don Juan to exact his revenge. Philippe soon discovers Maria mourning her dead father, and swears to avenge them both. He eventually finds Don Juan and the two engage in a duel which ends with Philippe's gory demise. The Jester then arrives to tell Juan that there is a spectral man who wants to speak with him in the cemetery.

Due to the accident, he becomes emotionally disturbed and undergoes psychological treatment with Dr. Beaumont , making some progress in dealing with the guilt over the accident. To help Max move forward, his father, Jack Matheson , reopens the Mayflower Department Store in New Orleans and invites Max to replace the security guard, who recently quit under mysterious circumstances while ""cutting himself up"" on duty. Max accepts the job and his father introduces him to the store manager, Keller Landreaux , the buyer, Jenna McCarty , and the vice-president of operations, Ryan Parker . Before his first shift, Max sees a vision of a dead woman in a mirror, and then sees Jenna's reflection, ripping off her head. Meanwhile, Jenna is killed by her reflection, being thrown through glass doors and a shard of glass decapitating her. Max realizes that he foresees the deaths in the mirrors. That night, he tries to find the ghost, but instead sees Ryan's reflection being eviscerated. He tries to contact Ryan, but gets no response. Later, Ryan is killed, in the same way as his reflection. Max sees his father's face covered in cuts in a puddle then races to his father's house. Jack is almost killed by his reflection, after Max made it to his house and hints to whoever is manipulating the mirrors that he would do whatever she wants him to do if she spares his father. Max later returns to the Mayflower, but he is stopped by Detectives Huston and Piccirilli , explaining about what happened in Ryan and Jenna's deaths. Max denies any involvements and, though they remain suspicious, they let Max get back to his work. Max goes to the main mirror, to find out who the ghost is. Suddenly, Max's reflection shows a light, which Max follows in each of the mirrors.

Howard and Irene's palatial mansion is packed with an endless assortment of cuckoo clocks, all in perfect synchronization, and Howard tape records all conversations in the house for later reference, hoping to catch Irene plotting an illicit liaison. Irene thus lives in a constant state of dread, wondering how far Howard's jealousy will go. Yet despite Howard's continual accusations of infidelity, Irene remains faithful to Howard, despite nightly recurrent dreams of a fantasy lover and an attraction to Howard's personal attorney, Barry Moreland , the only visitor allowed in the house. Howard spends most of his time working in his laboratory on a variety of projects, the nature of which he refuses to divulge to anyone. As tensions mount, Irene feels trapped in a loveless, lonely relationship. But suddenly, everything changes: Howard is killed by an explosion in his laboratory, and Irene inherits the house and Howard's entire fortune. The laboratory itself, a charred wreck, is secured from the rest of the house by a deadbolt so that no one may enter. Irene, after consulting with Barry Moreland, decides to move out of the house, into the back room apartment of a small beauty shop she owns, ""Irene's,"" which she operated before she met and married Howard. Almost immediately, the dreams begin again, with increasing intensity, until they take the form of an ""ideal"" man—known only as ""The Dream"" . Night after night, ""The Dream"" appears before Irene, whisking her away to a bizarre wedding ceremony in which she ""marries"" ""The Dream"" in front of a group of wax figure witnesses, or engages in a harmless tryst over champagne. Irene begins to doubt her sanity and unaccountably finds herself wishing to return to the nightmarish house she shared with Howard. But the reality behind Irene's dreams is a secret that The Night Walker withholds until the very end; a bizarre and complex tale of murder, betrayal, and deception."

The villagers resistance takes the form of covert activities including the publication of a Welsh news sheet. Eventually, even the singing of Welsh hymns in the chapel is outlawed. The murder of Reinhard Heydrich, whose assassination  by British-trained Czech agents in Prague sparked the actual Lidice massacre, is the catalyst for the systematic obliteration of Cwmgiedd in reprisal. The children of the village are marched out of school and join the womenfolk as they are loaded onto trucks. The men, defiantly singing ""Land of Our Fathers"" as they go, are lined up against the wall of the village churchyard."

Needing a place to hide out, Chips blackmails Tommy into taking him to the boarding house owned by his mother, Nora Taylor , and her longtime friend, Maggie Ryan ([[Una O'Connor , by threatening to turn the gun over to the police. Nora is overjoyed to see her son after an absence of five years. Tommy introduces them to Chips, who pretends to be a man named Grasselli recovering from a nervous condition. By chance, Maggie's showgirl daughter, Sarah Jane , returns the same day. The two mothers dream of their children getting married, but Tommy seems indifferent to Sarah Jane. Sarah Jane becomes suspicious of Grasselli, who does his best to avoid being seen. She eventually hides in the hall bathroom and recognizes him, having worked for him once. Unwilling to get Nora and Maggie in trouble, she agrees to keep Chips' secret. Nora starts mothering Chips, as does Maggie after a while. Tired of hiding in his room all the time, Chips emerges and becomes acquainted with the other boarders: Miss Flint , Mr. Salmon ([[Grant Mitchell , washed up magician The Great Boldini , and Mr. Van Diver. When Sarah Jane learns that Nora and Maggie are about to lose their house due to unpaid taxes, she turns to Chips for help.

Sarah Jane intimates that Chips will have her killed in a gruesome manner if she tells anyone what she knows, but on opening night, after drinking too much champagne, she becomes so frightened by Chips' remarks she goes to the police. Two detectives spot Chips in the nightclub, but agree to let him watch the rest of the show. Tommy sees the cops and assumes the worst. He goes to the roof to be alone. When Sarah Jane joins him there, he finally admits he loves her. She urges him to flee, but he refuses to run away. Though he can easily incriminate Tommy, Chips decides to confess to the murder."

After Monday leaves, Vanessa finds Nima, and learns the contents of the envelope. Monday catches up with Wilee before he leaves the campus where Nima lives and threatens him for the ticket. Wilee escapes and heads to the police station to report Monday, only to find out he's a police officer, and hides in the bathroom, where he opens the envelope and finds the ticket.

Soon after the wedding, Grierson requests the loan of a significant sum of money from Nevern and is furious and humiliated to be flatly turned down. He begins to make elaborate plans to murder Nevern on the assumption that Margaret will then inherit her husband's estate. Meanwhile the desperately unhappy Margaret has rekindled her relationship with Hardwick. Nevern finds them in a café together and causes a public scene. Margaret determines that her only course of action is to divorce Nevern, a prospect which horrifies her father. Nevern is in the process of composing a new song, and lodges a draft manuscript with his publisher. Making sure he has set up a foolproof alibi, Grierson goes to Nevern's house and kills him as he is finalising his new composition. As he leaves through one door, Hardwick, intending to ask Nevern to divorce Margaret, arrives through another. Hardwick finds the body and alerts the police, who in the circumstances do not believe his story and arrest him on suspicion of murder. The interested parties later gather at Nevern's home to hear the reading of the will. Margaret is declared the sole inheritor of all her husband's money and assets, to the delight of her father. He is so happy that he begins to whistle, and gives himself away because it is Nevern's finished composition, which he could only have heard by being in the house on the night of the murder.

The French have removed large numbers of troops from their African possessions, leaving the way open for revolt. American soldier of fortune Mike Conway  sees a chance to pay his way back to the United States by gunrunning to hostile Tuaregs. Wearing a slouch hat and bush jacket, Conway is armed with a Thompson sub machine gun and a wristwatch with an alarm engraved ""From Conway to Conway"". He finds himself walking a razor's edge between an anti-French Tuareg leader  keen for Conway's supply of weapons but keener to use his tarantulas on his prisoners, a moderate Imam  wanting peace, the local French Foreign Legion commander , and the commander's attractive wife  who Conway cannot keep away from."

Palast introduces George W. Bush with particular reference to his popular image as a war hero cemented in the public mind by his landing on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln for the 2003 Mission Accomplished Speech. However Palast alleges that Bush used his father’s influence to gain a draft-dodging placement with the Texas Air National Guard which he subsequently failed to serve.  Palast picks up the story with Bush’s 2000 US Presidential Election campaign where he claims Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris used their influence to purge and discount the ballots of predominantly Gore-supporting black voters through the “fake felons list” compiled by private company DBT/ChoicePoint for US$4 million.  Palast goes on to examine the corporate donors to Bush’s election campaign, such as Enron CEO Ken Lay, who as members of Bush’s pioneer network contributed huge sums through family and friends, and who he claims subsequently profited from the Bush presidency with senior government appointments, no-bid contracts, executive orders and deregulation.  Palast outlines what he refers to as the Bush-cycle, where Bush family members use money to gain political office and then use the office to gain even more money, dating back to Senator Prescott Bush who funded the family’s entry into the oil business, citing the example of Bush’s Harken Energy winning a contract to drill in the Persian Gulf thanks he alleges to Bush Snr’s presidency.  Palast alleges that both prior to and since the September 11 attacks Bush has blocked investigations into members of the Bin Laden family and other rich Saudis, who are alleged to have provided funding to Al Qaeda and which have long been funnelling money into Bush family business ventures via businessman James R. Bath, who was a part owner of Bush’s failed Arbusto Energy.  Palast concludes with Bush’s declaration of the Iraq War, which he claims was made to fulfil a long planned strategy, drawn up at the beginning of Bush’s presidency, to divide and sell up all of Iraq’s assets, especially the oil, to the Bush family’s corporate donors against the interests of the Iraqi people and their democratic ambitions.

Palast outlines what he refers to as the Bush-cycle, where Bush family members use money to gain political office and then use the office to gain even more money, dating back to Senator Prescott Bush who funded the family’s entry into the oil business, citing the example of Bush’s Harken Energy winning a contract to drill in the Persian Gulf thanks he alleges to Bush Snr’s presidency.  Palast alleges that both prior to and since the September 11 attacks Bush has blocked investigations into members of the Bin Laden family and other rich Saudis, who are alleged to have provided funding to Al Qaeda and which have long been funnelling money into Bush family business ventures via businessman James R. Bath, who was a part owner of Bush’s failed Arbusto Energy.  Palast concludes with Bush’s declaration of the Iraq War, which he claims was made to fulfil a long planned strategy, drawn up at the beginning of Bush’s presidency, to divide and sell up all of Iraq’s assets, especially the oil, to the Bush family’s corporate donors against the interests of the Iraqi people and their democratic ambitions.

She returns home early the next morning, leaving a note of explanation for John. Unfortunately John forgets the name of Katherine's hotel, so does not receive the note and is distraught when she fails to turn up for their rendezvous. Meanwhile back at home, Katherine finds that Dennis is accompanied by Max Borrow , an old admirer who still wants to marry her. He has sustained serious eye injuries while saving Dennis' life, and Katherine as a result feels she must accept him. Dennis himself immediately rekindles his courtship with local schoolteacher Stella White . John remembers that Katherine's father is due to return to London from the conference and waits at the station until he arrives. They learn from the hotel why Katherine departed so hurriedly, and Rev. Britton invites John back to their village where he knows the local squire is looking for help in cataloguing his library. John is deeply upset to discover Katherine is engaged, and also resentful towards Dennis and Stella for their obvious happiness together. Katherine finally admits to John the reason she and Max are engaged, and John agrees to not pursue matters unless Max can be cured. Max goes off for a medical examination, and John is recalled to his ship. As he is about to leave, a fire breaks out in a storage shed where children are playing. Max, having been told that his sight is safe, arrives back while the drama is in progress, and John is injured as he rescues the children. Katherine's reaction leaves Max in no doubt as to her feelings. That evening he tells her that he knows the situation, and will release her from her obligation to him so that she may marry John.

Kyung-chul kills her and scatters her body parts. When a boy discovers one of Joo-yun's ears, police are called and find the rest of the body, under the command of Squad Chief Jang , who is the father of Joo-yun. Joo-yun's fiancé, Soo-hyun , who is a secret service agent of the National Intelligence Service , becomes determined to track down and take vengeance on Joo-yun's murderer. Jang supplies Soo-hyun with a list of four potential killers, including Kyung-chul. Searching Kyung-chul's home, Soo-hyun finds jewelry and underwear that Kyung-chul has taken from  numerous victims. When he finds Joo-yun's wedding ring he knows that Kyung-chul's is the killer. Soo-hyun puts a tracking device on the school bus, tracking then attacking Kyung-chul while sexually assaulting his latest victim&mdash;one of the schoolgirls he was transporting home. Rendering him unconscious, he places an NIS transmitter inside Kyung-chul, so he can better track his location and listen to his conversations. Waking up, Kyung-chul flags down a taxi, killing the driver and passenger before going to a medical centre, where he sexually assaults a nurse, only to be again attacked by Soo-hyun. Kyung-chul goes to the home of his friend Tae-joo , a cannibalistic murderer with a freezer full of bodies. After explaining his situation, Tae-joo remarks that whoever is after him must have some relation to one of his victims. Soo-hyun arrives at the house, where he proceeds to incapacitate both murderers and Tae-joo's girlfriend Se-jung . The next day, both Tae-joo and Se-jung are found by the police and sent to a hospital. Meanwhile, a trusted subordinate of Soo-hyun's ensures he and Kyung-chul are sent to a private medical area away from the police. The barely conscious Kyung-chul hears them talk about the transmitter inside him. Soo-hyun dumps Kyung-chul, intending to continue tracking and attacking him. Kyung-chul taunts him over the transmitter, now knowing who he is and how he's being tracked. To make Soo-hyun lose track of him, Kyung-chul brutally assaults a store owner, directing Soo-hyun to rush to the aid of the victim before he dies. Kyung-chul uses this time to defecate out the transmitter and place it inside a taxi driver he viciously assaults. Soo-hyun interrogates Tae-joo and learns that Kyung-chul is going after Joo-yun's father Jang and sister Se-yun . Soo-hyun arrives too late to stop Kyung-chul, who blinds Jang with a dumbbell and murders Se-yun. He abducts Kyung-chul before he can turn himself over to the police. Soo-hyun tortures him physically and mentally before setting up a guillotine above Kyung-chul's head that is soon after activated when his parents and son arrive to visit and open the door to the room he is in. Placing a transmitter nearby, Soo-hyun's hears the death of Kyung-chul and his family's reaction to his decapitated corpse. Walking away from the house, Soo-hyun breaks down crying on the street, perhaps finally realizing that his ridiculous effort to stretch out his revenge has allowed Kyung-chul to murder three more people, sexually assault two other women, brutally assault three other men, then traumatized his family by making them 'responsible' for the guillotine death.

The barely conscious Kyung-chul hears them talk about the transmitter inside him. Soo-hyun dumps Kyung-chul, intending to continue tracking and attacking him. Kyung-chul taunts him over the transmitter, now knowing who he is and how he's being tracked. To make Soo-hyun lose track of him, Kyung-chul brutally assaults a store owner, directing Soo-hyun to rush to the aid of the victim before he dies.

Soo-hyun interrogates Tae-joo and learns that Kyung-chul is going after Joo-yun's father Jang and sister Se-yun . Soo-hyun arrives too late to stop Kyung-chul, who blinds Jang with a dumbbell and murders Se-yun. He abducts Kyung-chul before he can turn himself over to the police. Soo-hyun tortures him physically and mentally before setting up a guillotine above Kyung-chul's head that is soon after activated when his parents and son arrive to visit and open the door to the room he is in. Placing a transmitter nearby, Soo-hyun's hears the death of Kyung-chul and his family's reaction to his decapitated corpse. Walking away from the house, Soo-hyun breaks down crying on the street, perhaps finally realizing that his ridiculous effort to stretch out his revenge has allowed Kyung-chul to murder three more people, sexually assault two other women, brutally assault three other men, then traumatized his family by making them 'responsible' for the guillotine death.

Kyung-chul kills her and scatters her body parts. When a boy discovers one of Joo-yun's ears, police are called and find the rest of the body, under the command of Squad Chief Jang , who is the father of Joo-yun. Joo-yun's fiancé, Soo-hyun , who is a secret service agent of the National Intelligence Service , becomes determined to track down and take vengeance on Joo-yun's murderer. Jang supplies Soo-hyun with a list of four potential killers, including Kyung-chul. Searching Kyung-chul's home, Soo-hyun finds jewelry and underwear that Kyung-chul has taken from  numerous victims. When he finds Joo-yun's wedding ring he knows that Kyung-chul's is the killer. Soo-hyun puts a tracking device on the school bus, tracking then attacking Kyung-chul while sexually assaulting his latest victim&mdash;one of the schoolgirls he was transporting home. Rendering him unconscious, he places an NIS transmitter inside Kyung-chul, so he can better track his location and listen to his conversations. Waking up, Kyung-chul flags down a taxi, killing the driver and passenger before going to a medical centre, where he sexually assaults a nurse, only to be again attacked by Soo-hyun.

Kyung-chul taunts him over the transmitter, now knowing who he is and how he's being tracked.

Kyung-chul kills her and scatters her body parts. When a boy discovers one of Joo-yun's ears, police are called and find the rest of the body, under the command of Squad Chief Jang , who is the father of Joo-yun. Joo-yun's fiancé, Soo-hyun , who is a secret service agent of the National Intelligence Service , becomes determined to track down and take vengeance on Joo-yun's murderer. Jang supplies Soo-hyun with a list of four potential killers, including Kyung-chul. Searching Kyung-chul's home, Soo-hyun finds jewelry and underwear that Kyung-chul has taken from  numerous victims. When he finds Joo-yun's wedding ring he knows that Kyung-chul's is the killer. Soo-hyun puts a tracking device on the school bus, tracking then attacking Kyung-chul while sexually assaulting his latest victim&mdash;one of the schoolgirls he was transporting home. Rendering him unconscious, he places an NIS transmitter inside Kyung-chul, so he can better track his location and listen to his conversations. Waking up, Kyung-chul flags down a taxi, killing the driver and passenger before going to a medical centre, where he sexually assaults a nurse, only to be again attacked by Soo-hyun.

Kyung-chul kills her and scatters her body parts. When a boy discovers one of Joo-yun's ears, police are called and find the rest of the body, under the command of Squad Chief Jang , who is the father of Joo-yun. Joo-yun's fiancé, Soo-hyun , who is a secret service agent of the National Intelligence Service , becomes determined to track down and take vengeance on Joo-yun's murderer. Jang supplies Soo-hyun with a list of four potential killers, including Kyung-chul. Searching Kyung-chul's home, Soo-hyun finds jewelry and underwear that Kyung-chul has taken from  numerous victims. When he finds Joo-yun's wedding ring he knows that Kyung-chul's is the killer. Soo-hyun puts a tracking device on the school bus, tracking then attacking Kyung-chul while sexually assaulting his latest victim&mdash;one of the schoolgirls he was transporting home. Rendering him unconscious, he places an NIS transmitter inside Kyung-chul, so he can better track his location and listen to his conversations. Waking up, Kyung-chul flags down a taxi, killing the driver and passenger before going to a medical centre, where he sexually assaults a nurse, only to be again attacked by Soo-hyun. Kyung-chul goes to the home of his friend Tae-joo , a cannibalistic murderer with a freezer full of bodies. After explaining his situation, Tae-joo remarks that whoever is after him must have some relation to one of his victims. Soo-hyun arrives at the house, where he proceeds to incapacitate both murderers and Tae-joo's girlfriend Se-jung . The next day, both Tae-joo and Se-jung are found by the police and sent to a hospital. Meanwhile, a trusted subordinate of Soo-hyun's ensures he and Kyung-chul are sent to a private medical area away from the police. The barely conscious Kyung-chul hears them talk about the transmitter inside him. Soo-hyun dumps Kyung-chul, intending to continue tracking and attacking him. Kyung-chul taunts him over the transmitter, now knowing who he is and how he's being tracked. To make Soo-hyun lose track of him, Kyung-chul brutally assaults a store owner, directing Soo-hyun to rush to the aid of the victim before he dies. Kyung-chul uses this time to defecate out the transmitter and place it inside a taxi driver he viciously assaults. Soo-hyun interrogates Tae-joo and learns that Kyung-chul is going after Joo-yun's father Jang and sister Se-yun . Soo-hyun arrives too late to stop Kyung-chul, who blinds Jang with a dumbbell and murders Se-yun. He abducts Kyung-chul before he can turn himself over to the police.

The killer spots Lawes at his window, and realises he has been seen. The following evening, Lawes' daughter Janice  finds her father also murdered. An investigation is launched by the local police and a private insurance investigator Dermot Kinross . The initial assumption &ndash; that Lawes was murdered by the gendarme's killer to prevent identification &ndash; soon comes into question as several other individuals connected to Lawes are revealed to have plausible motives for the murder. Lawes' son Toby  is found to have been embezzling funds from his father to pay off a blackmailing ex-mistress; Toby's fiancée Eve , living directly opposite the murder scene, is investigated and found to have in her possession bloodstained clothing which she cannot satisfactorily explain away. Eve's ex-husband Ned  turns out to have a particular interest in a rare snuffbox from Lawes' personal collection which is discovered to be missing, and may have killed Lawes when disturbed in the process of burglary. Eve comes under particular scrutiny as it is considered she could have been an accomplice of either Toby or Ned. It falls to Kinross to unravel the actual chain of events and arrive at the correct solution.

Even Singh, the man who she admires enough to call a friend, is in for a shock. Navdeep doesn’t want to get married; she’s intent on being the guardian of her loving parents because the family lacks a male heir. Few scene were also filmed in Post Graduate College Sector 11 Chandigarh. Singh tests his own view of women by agreeing to all of Navdeep’s demands, including moving in with her family after marriage. This is seen as both revolutionary  and an affront to Punjabi society and tradition.Manmohan Singh's Ik Kudi Punjab Di: gender equality gets an entertaining treatment

He has a wife named Vickie and an eight-year-old son named Scott. Eddie's friend and co-worker, Nick, and two other co-workers have formed a secret vigilante group because Nick and the group are fed up with the pimps, gangs, and drug dealers who keep taking over the neighborhoods. Nick and his group are also sick and tired of the police, because the police always fail to protect people who become victims. Eddie returns home from work one night, only to discover that Vickie has been stabbed, and Scott has been shot dead in a home invasion led by a street gang that Vickie encountered earlier. Frederico ""Rico"" Melendez, the leader of a Puerto Rican street gang, is arrested for Vickie's stabbing and Scott's murder. Assistant District Attorney Mary Fletcher plans to put Rico away for as long as possible, since New York doesn't have the death penalty. Nick tries to convince Eddie to join the vigilante group, but Eddie turns Nick down, preferring to let the courts handle Rico. Nick makes it clear that he has no faith whatsoever in the police and the judicial system. Nick turns out to be right; the case against Rico doesn't make it past the arraignment. After Rico's corrupt lawyer, Eisenburg, argues for the case to be dismissed after Rico pleads guilty to Vicki's assault, but not guilty to Scott's murder, the corrupt Judge Sinclair sets Rico free with a two year suspended sentence. Eddie goes crazy and tries to strangle Judge Sinclair, who sentences Eddie to spend 30 days in jail. It was actually Rico's sadistic right hand man, Prago, who had fired the shot that killed Scott while Rico was the one who stabbed Vickie. Prago also bribed Judge Sinclair, as well as Eisenburg, to set Rico free. With Eddie in prison, Nick and his group try to track down the source of drugs that have been sweeping their neighborhood. Nick chases after a small-time drug dealer whom they rough up who points him to his supplier; a local Manhattan pimp. Nick and the group follow and confront the pimp and torture him to reveal his drug source and the pimp points them to a high-ranking member of the New York mayor's office. In prison, Eddie befriends an inmate named Rake  who saves him from being gang raped in the showers. As soon as Eddie is released from jail after serving his 30-day-sentence, he changes his mind about Nick's vigilante group. Eddie willingly joins the group so he can track down and kill Rico, Prago, as well as Judge Sinclair. But will Eddie's quest for revenge trigger an all-out street war between them, the gang, and the incompetent police?"

When the USS Acushnet dives under the ice, a young Ahab listens for enemy subs when suddenly he detects an unknown target. When the captain listens, he hears nothing, but Ahab insists in the presence of an emptiness. The target dives into a trench, but the captain abandons his search in favor of photographing the target. The target attacks the submarine as Ahab hears a roar. The sub is brought to the icy surface, and the target identifies itself as a gigantic, white, whale-like creature. Ahab survives, but loses his leg to the beast when it hauls the other half of the sub back underwater. In the present day, Dr. Michelle Herman  and her assistant Pip  test a whale song generator when the USS Pequod surfaces behind them and Lieutenant Commander Starbuck , the executive officer, persuades them to come aboard. In the sub, Starbuck tells them about several attacks in which eyewitnesses all report seeing an enormous whale. Although Michelle explains that the whale song generator needs a recorded whale vocalization, Captain Ahab  comes to the deck and gives her the recording he took of Moby Dick back in 1969. Although Michelle disagrees on joining a Navy sub with the intent of killing an animal, she has no choice. In San Diego, Captain Boomer  is told by his superiors of suspicious activity revolving around the Pequod. He is assigned to investigate, and thanks to a survivor from a recent attack by the White Whale, he comes to the conclusion that Ahab is on the hunt for Moby Dick. Meanwhile, the USS Essex is searching for the Pequod off Hawaii. When they go to active sonar, it attracts the attention of the wandering Moby Dick. The Essex engages at what appears to be the sub they were searching for, but realizes too late that their adversary is biological just before the sub is destroyed by a torpedo it shot. Later the Pequod comes to their location with no sign of the whale, but encounter the corpses of Essex crew. Rousing his crew with a speech, Ahab moves on to search for the beast. A helicopter in search of the Pequod encounters it while the sub is following a 600-foot target. As the helicopter engages them, the sub fires a nuke at the unknown target, but the confused helicopter crew tell them they shot a school of giant squid just before they are swallowed alive by Moby Dick. The whale then attacks the S.S. Rachel, a cruise liner, when the Pequod intervenes with Michelle's whalesong generator. This, although, causes the whale to attack them, subsequently destroying a fin on the Pequod. The sub fires a harpoon made from the Acushnets hull on top of Moby Dick's eye, which forces him to dive deeper, dragging the Pequod with it. As the water pressure begins to damage the hull, the line snaps and Starbuck forces the ship to surface. Moby-Dick surfaces too, and the Pequod, along with the help of Boomer in a helicopter, forces the whale into an atoll. The sub gets trapped in shallow water, and three boats are sent out to face the whale with guns and Ahab's harpoon. Moby-Dick destroys two of the boats and forces the survivors onto the island's shores. The whale attacks them again, resulting in the death of Queequeg . Ahab takes the last boat and fires his harpoon at the whale's other eye. Moby Dick destroys the boat, killing Ahab. The remaining crew of the Pequod, including Starbuck, and Pip, follow Ahab's orders and fire nukes at the island. Moby Dick dodges the nukes and crushes the Pequod just as the island explodes. The film ends with the White Whale surviving to wreak havoc another day, and with Michelle swimming to the surface just as a rescue helicopter arrives.

Nick's friend Chet , a school teacher, discovers that Nick has slept with, and still has feelings for, Chet's twin sister Kate . It is also revealed that Chet was the reason Nick's parents divorced, because he told Nick's father that his wife had been cheating on him with a lifeguard. After a heated argument, the two end their friendship. Meanwhile, two delinquents named Dwayne King  and Travis Cord  are miserable living under the shadow of Dwayne's domineering father the Major . Dwayne confides in stripper Juicy  about his contempt for his dad, who is squandering the money that he won playing the lottery. Juicy says she can hire a hitman to kill Dwayne's dad for $100,000 so Dwayne can collect the inheritance. Dwayne plots that they kidnap a complete stranger and force him to rob a bank for the hit money by strapping a bomb to his chest. After seeing an advertisement for the pizzeria that Nick works at, they order a pizza and wait for the driver to come to their hideout. When Nick arrives, Dwayne and Travis  assault him and knock him unconscious. When Nick wakes up, he finds a vest rigged with explosives strapped and buckled onto his torso. Dwayne and Travis tell him his situation: if he does not rob a bank in 10 hours, they will detonate the bomb, demonstrating the bomb on a stuffed Teddy bear. Dwayne states that if he dares to go to the police, they will detonate the bomb as they will be monitoring him and they end up sending Nick on his way. In his panic, Nick goes to a school where Chet is working and desperately pleads with him to help. After plans to deactivate or remove the bomb are dashed, Chet says he has no choice but to rob the bank. Still uneasy, Nick asks Chet to assist him. Chet reluctantly agrees. After purchasing airsoft guns, spray paint, 5-Hour Energy, and ski masks for the robbery, Nick suggests stealing Chet's family friend's Datsun 280ZX so that the police will be unable to track the license plate number of Nick's Mustang. Nick then stops by his workplace to tell off his boss and to go see Kate and say some final words to her. Nick and Chet later arrive at the bank, hold it up, and obtain the money upon forcing a bank employee named Sandra  to empty the vault. Though one bag of money was rigged with dye, Chet forces Sandra to get the ones that are not rigged with dye. However, the bank manager had pulled the alarm, forcing Nick and Chet to flee as Dwayne and Travis watch. After a car chase that ends up with Nick and Chet crashing the 280ZX, the two successfully evade capture by sneaking onto a bus. Nick calls Dwayne and tells him he has the money. Dwayne says he and Travis will meet him at an abandoned rail-yard to make the exchange. Dwayne and Travis go to a restaurant instead. When Dwayne asks Travis to possibly be the one to detonate the bomb if the time comes, Travis starts to become unsettled. After getting his Mustang, Nick waits for Dwayne and Travis at the railyard while Chet hides somewhere to avoid a confrontation about his involvement in the scheme. Instead of Dwayne or Travis however, Juicy and the hitman Chongo  are the ones who arrive to pick up the money. Nick hands Chongo the money and expects Chongo to give him the code which will deactivate the bomb. Chongo claims he does not know what the code is. When Nick keeps asking him for the code, Chongo gets aggravated and holds Nick at gunpoint. Chet runs in and beats Chongo while Nick incapacitates Juicy. The two grab the money and escape. Dwayne ends up getting two phone calls: one from Chongo calling to let Dwayne know that because of Chet's ambush, he will be coming after Dwayne also. The second is from Nick who berates Dwayne for not giving Chongo the code to the bomb and dares him to detonate the bomb with the money at his side. Overly frustrated by these turn of events, Dwayne activates the speed dial number on his phone for the bomb to explode, but finds that Travis altered the numbers while Dwayne was not looking because he was getting nervous about Dwayne's gradually violent attitude. The two head back to Kate's apartment in their masks and kidnap her from the girls' bathroom. Dwayne calls Nick to let him know that he has Kate and if he does not meet at the scrapyard to give him the money, he will kill her. Meanwhile, Chongo breaks into the Major's house to find information regarding Dwayne's location and finds a hand-drawn map to the scrapyard. While there, the Major attacks him with a pen gun and is shot in the stomach after a struggle. Nick arrives at the scrapyard and exchanges the money for Kate. Dwayne gives Nick the code  to deactivate and unbuckle the bomb with minutes to spare. Dwayne then tells Nick to walk away, but Nick deduces that as soon as Nick and Kate turn around, they will just kill them both. Dwayne confirms this by pointing a gun at them while Travis comes out wielding a flamethrower. Nick says he hired a sniper in case this were to happen. This is proved to be fake as it is only Chet who is using a laser pointer, but it is enough to fool Dwayne and Travis into lowering their weapons. Chongo arrives shortly after and knocks Nick out cold, then spots Dwayne and Travis. Despite handing him the money, Chongo holds the two at gun point. Pressured, Travis responds by torching Chongo with the flamethrower. Although burnt to death, Chongo manages to shoot Dwayne in the shoulder and shoot the fuel tank for the flamethrower causing it to explode on Travis's back.

Nick's friend Chet , a school teacher, discovers that Nick has slept with, and still has feelings for, Chet's twin sister Kate . It is also revealed that Chet was the reason Nick's parents divorced, because he told Nick's father that his wife had been cheating on him with a lifeguard. After a heated argument, the two end their friendship. Meanwhile, two delinquents named Dwayne King  and Travis Cord  are miserable living under the shadow of Dwayne's domineering father the Major . Dwayne confides in stripper Juicy  about his contempt for his dad, who is squandering the money that he won playing the lottery. Juicy says she can hire a hitman to kill Dwayne's dad for $100,000 so Dwayne can collect the inheritance. Dwayne plots that they kidnap a complete stranger and force him to rob a bank for the hit money by strapping a bomb to his chest. After seeing an advertisement for the pizzeria that Nick works at, they order a pizza and wait for the driver to come to their hideout. When Nick arrives, Dwayne and Travis  assault him and knock him unconscious. When Nick wakes up, he finds a vest rigged with explosives strapped and buckled onto his torso. Dwayne and Travis tell him his situation: if he does not rob a bank in 10 hours, they will detonate the bomb, demonstrating the bomb on a stuffed Teddy bear. Dwayne states that if he dares to go to the police, they will detonate the bomb as they will be monitoring him and they end up sending Nick on his way. In his panic, Nick goes to a school where Chet is working and desperately pleads with him to help. After plans to deactivate or remove the bomb are dashed, Chet says he has no choice but to rob the bank. Still uneasy, Nick asks Chet to assist him. Chet reluctantly agrees. After purchasing airsoft guns, spray paint, 5-Hour Energy, and ski masks for the robbery, Nick suggests stealing Chet's family friend's Datsun 280ZX so that the police will be unable to track the license plate number of Nick's Mustang. Nick then stops by his workplace to tell off his boss and to go see Kate and say some final words to her. Nick and Chet later arrive at the bank, hold it up, and obtain the money upon forcing a bank employee named Sandra  to empty the vault. Though one bag of money was rigged with dye, Chet forces Sandra to get the ones that are not rigged with dye. However, the bank manager had pulled the alarm, forcing Nick and Chet to flee as Dwayne and Travis watch. After a car chase that ends up with Nick and Chet crashing the 280ZX, the two successfully evade capture by sneaking onto a bus. Nick calls Dwayne and tells him he has the money. Dwayne says he and Travis will meet him at an abandoned rail-yard to make the exchange. Dwayne and Travis go to a restaurant instead. When Dwayne asks Travis to possibly be the one to detonate the bomb if the time comes, Travis starts to become unsettled. After getting his Mustang, Nick waits for Dwayne and Travis at the railyard while Chet hides somewhere to avoid a confrontation about his involvement in the scheme. Instead of Dwayne or Travis however, Juicy and the hitman Chongo  are the ones who arrive to pick up the money. Nick hands Chongo the money and expects Chongo to give him the code which will deactivate the bomb. Chongo claims he does not know what the code is. When Nick keeps asking him for the code, Chongo gets aggravated and holds Nick at gunpoint. Chet runs in and beats Chongo while Nick incapacitates Juicy. The two grab the money and escape. Dwayne ends up getting two phone calls: one from Chongo calling to let Dwayne know that because of Chet's ambush, he will be coming after Dwayne also. The second is from Nick who berates Dwayne for not giving Chongo the code to the bomb and dares him to detonate the bomb with the money at his side. Overly frustrated by these turn of events, Dwayne activates the speed dial number on his phone for the bomb to explode, but finds that Travis altered the numbers while Dwayne was not looking because he was getting nervous about Dwayne's gradually violent attitude. The two head back to Kate's apartment in their masks and kidnap her from the girls' bathroom. Dwayne calls Nick to let him know that he has Kate and if he does not meet at the scrapyard to give him the money, he will kill her. Meanwhile, Chongo breaks into the Major's house to find information regarding Dwayne's location and finds a hand-drawn map to the scrapyard. While there, the Major attacks him with a pen gun and is shot in the stomach after a struggle. Nick arrives at the scrapyard and exchanges the money for Kate. Dwayne gives Nick the code  to deactivate and unbuckle the bomb with minutes to spare. Dwayne then tells Nick to walk away, but Nick deduces that as soon as Nick and Kate turn around, they will just kill them both. Dwayne confirms this by pointing a gun at them while Travis comes out wielding a flamethrower. Nick says he hired a sniper in case this were to happen. This is proved to be fake as it is only Chet who is using a laser pointer, but it is enough to fool Dwayne and Travis into lowering their weapons. Chongo arrives shortly after and knocks Nick out cold, then spots Dwayne and Travis. Despite handing him the money, Chongo holds the two at gun point. Pressured, Travis responds by torching Chongo with the flamethrower. Although burnt to death, Chongo manages to shoot Dwayne in the shoulder and shoot the fuel tank for the flamethrower causing it to explode on Travis's back. Nick quickly wakes up, grabs the money and drives away with Chet and Kate.

When Dwayne asks Travis to possibly be the one to detonate the bomb if the time comes, Travis starts to become unsettled. After getting his Mustang, Nick waits for Dwayne and Travis at the railyard while Chet hides somewhere to avoid a confrontation about his involvement in the scheme. Instead of Dwayne or Travis however, Juicy and the hitman Chongo  are the ones who arrive to pick up the money. Nick hands Chongo the money and expects Chongo to give him the code which will deactivate the bomb. Chongo claims he does not know what the code is. When Nick keeps asking him for the code, Chongo gets aggravated and holds Nick at gunpoint. Chet runs in and beats Chongo while Nick incapacitates Juicy. The two grab the money and escape. Dwayne ends up getting two phone calls: one from Chongo calling to let Dwayne know that because of Chet's ambush, he will be coming after Dwayne also. The second is from Nick who berates Dwayne for not giving Chongo the code to the bomb and dares him to detonate the bomb with the money at his side. Overly frustrated by these turn of events, Dwayne activates the speed dial number on his phone for the bomb to explode, but finds that Travis altered the numbers while Dwayne was not looking because he was getting nervous about Dwayne's gradually violent attitude. The two head back to Kate's apartment in their masks and kidnap her from the girls' bathroom. Dwayne calls Nick to let him know that he has Kate and if he does not meet at the scrapyard to give him the money, he will kill her. Meanwhile, Chongo breaks into the Major's house to find information regarding Dwayne's location and finds a hand-drawn map to the scrapyard. While there, the Major attacks him with a pen gun and is shot in the stomach after a struggle. Nick arrives at the scrapyard and exchanges the money for Kate. Dwayne gives Nick the code  to deactivate and unbuckle the bomb with minutes to spare. Dwayne then tells Nick to walk away, but Nick deduces that as soon as Nick and Kate turn around, they will just kill them both. Dwayne confirms this by pointing a gun at them while Travis comes out wielding a flamethrower. Nick says he hired a sniper in case this were to happen. This is proved to be fake as it is only Chet who is using a laser pointer, but it is enough to fool Dwayne and Travis into lowering their weapons. Chongo arrives shortly after and knocks Nick out cold, then spots Dwayne and Travis. Despite handing him the money, Chongo holds the two at gun point. Pressured, Travis responds by torching Chongo with the flamethrower. Although burnt to death, Chongo manages to shoot Dwayne in the shoulder and shoot the fuel tank for the flamethrower causing it to explode on Travis's back. Nick quickly wakes up, grabs the money and drives away with Chet and Kate. Still alive, Dwayne spots them running off, but first reconciles with Travis upon putting out the flames on him before heading off. Dwayne catches up to the others with his van, but he hears a beeping sound in the back and the van explodes. Nick reveals that as he grabbed the money, he reactivated the bomb and threw it in the back of the van. Now free with the money in their possession, the three drive off discussing what to do with their newly acquired windfall, but discover that one set has been rigged with dye that sprays Chet in the face. In the post-credits, Dwayne , the Major , Travis, and Juicy are seen in a commercial for Dwayne and Travis' tanning salon business called Major Tan, the cover-up for the prostitution ring Dwayne had been planning.  In the alternate ending, Nick, Chet, and Kate drive off with the money and discuss what they will do with their new found riches. Meanwhile, just miles behind them, Dwayne is revealed to have survived the explosion that occurred moments earlier. Annoyed with his plan's failure, he goes to his father's mansion to see if Chongo killed him. Dwayne finds his dad on the ground suffering from his gunshot wound and tells about his plans for the tanning salon/brothel. His father is excited and tells his son that he is proud of him. The scene changes to a Four Seasons in Atlanta where Kate is managing the special events program. She joins up with Nick and Chet, who are chilling out by the pool enjoying their new lives."

Nick's friend Chet , a school teacher, discovers that Nick has slept with, and still has feelings for, Chet's twin sister Kate . It is also revealed that Chet was the reason Nick's parents divorced, because he told Nick's father that his wife had been cheating on him with a lifeguard. After a heated argument, the two end their friendship. Meanwhile, two delinquents named Dwayne King  and Travis Cord  are miserable living under the shadow of Dwayne's domineering father the Major . Dwayne confides in stripper Juicy  about his contempt for his dad, who is squandering the money that he won playing the lottery. Juicy says she can hire a hitman to kill Dwayne's dad for $100,000 so Dwayne can collect the inheritance. Dwayne plots that they kidnap a complete stranger and force him to rob a bank for the hit money by strapping a bomb to his chest. After seeing an advertisement for the pizzeria that Nick works at, they order a pizza and wait for the driver to come to their hideout. When Nick arrives, Dwayne and Travis  assault him and knock him unconscious. When Nick wakes up, he finds a vest rigged with explosives strapped and buckled onto his torso. Dwayne and Travis tell him his situation: if he does not rob a bank in 10 hours, they will detonate the bomb, demonstrating the bomb on a stuffed Teddy bear. Dwayne states that if he dares to go to the police, they will detonate the bomb as they will be monitoring him and they end up sending Nick on his way. In his panic, Nick goes to a school where Chet is working and desperately pleads with him to help. After plans to deactivate or remove the bomb are dashed, Chet says he has no choice but to rob the bank. Still uneasy, Nick asks Chet to assist him. Chet reluctantly agrees. After purchasing airsoft guns, spray paint, 5-Hour Energy, and ski masks for the robbery, Nick suggests stealing Chet's family friend's Datsun 280ZX so that the police will be unable to track the license plate number of Nick's Mustang. Nick then stops by his workplace to tell off his boss and to go see Kate and say some final words to her. Nick and Chet later arrive at the bank, hold it up, and obtain the money upon forcing a bank employee named Sandra  to empty the vault. Though one bag of money was rigged with dye, Chet forces Sandra to get the ones that are not rigged with dye. However, the bank manager had pulled the alarm, forcing Nick and Chet to flee as Dwayne and Travis watch.

Nick's friend Chet , a school teacher, discovers that Nick has slept with, and still has feelings for, Chet's twin sister Kate . It is also revealed that Chet was the reason Nick's parents divorced, because he told Nick's father that his wife had been cheating on him with a lifeguard. After a heated argument, the two end their friendship. Meanwhile, two delinquents named Dwayne King  and Travis Cord  are miserable living under the shadow of Dwayne's domineering father the Major . Dwayne confides in stripper Juicy  about his contempt for his dad, who is squandering the money that he won playing the lottery. Juicy says she can hire a hitman to kill Dwayne's dad for $100,000 so Dwayne can collect the inheritance. Dwayne plots that they kidnap a complete stranger and force him to rob a bank for the hit money by strapping a bomb to his chest. After seeing an advertisement for the pizzeria that Nick works at, they order a pizza and wait for the driver to come to their hideout. When Nick arrives, Dwayne and Travis  assault him and knock him unconscious. When Nick wakes up, he finds a vest rigged with explosives strapped and buckled onto his torso. Dwayne and Travis tell him his situation: if he does not rob a bank in 10 hours, they will detonate the bomb, demonstrating the bomb on a stuffed Teddy bear. Dwayne states that if he dares to go to the police, they will detonate the bomb as they will be monitoring him and they end up sending Nick on his way. In his panic, Nick goes to a school where Chet is working and desperately pleads with him to help. After plans to deactivate or remove the bomb are dashed, Chet says he has no choice but to rob the bank. Still uneasy, Nick asks Chet to assist him. Chet reluctantly agrees. After purchasing airsoft guns, spray paint, 5-Hour Energy, and ski masks for the robbery, Nick suggests stealing Chet's family friend's Datsun 280ZX so that the police will be unable to track the license plate number of Nick's Mustang. Nick then stops by his workplace to tell off his boss and to go see Kate and say some final words to her. Nick and Chet later arrive at the bank, hold it up, and obtain the money upon forcing a bank employee named Sandra  to empty the vault. Though one bag of money was rigged with dye, Chet forces Sandra to get the ones that are not rigged with dye. However, the bank manager had pulled the alarm, forcing Nick and Chet to flee as Dwayne and Travis watch. After a car chase that ends up with Nick and Chet crashing the 280ZX, the two successfully evade capture by sneaking onto a bus. Nick calls Dwayne and tells him he has the money. Dwayne says he and Travis will meet him at an abandoned rail-yard to make the exchange. Dwayne and Travis go to a restaurant instead. When Dwayne asks Travis to possibly be the one to detonate the bomb if the time comes, Travis starts to become unsettled. After getting his Mustang, Nick waits for Dwayne and Travis at the railyard while Chet hides somewhere to avoid a confrontation about his involvement in the scheme. Instead of Dwayne or Travis however, Juicy and the hitman Chongo  are the ones who arrive to pick up the money. Nick hands Chongo the money and expects Chongo to give him the code which will deactivate the bomb. Chongo claims he does not know what the code is. When Nick keeps asking him for the code, Chongo gets aggravated and holds Nick at gunpoint. Chet runs in and beats Chongo while Nick incapacitates Juicy. The two grab the money and escape. Dwayne ends up getting two phone calls: one from Chongo calling to let Dwayne know that because of Chet's ambush, he will be coming after Dwayne also. The second is from Nick who berates Dwayne for not giving Chongo the code to the bomb and dares him to detonate the bomb with the money at his side. Overly frustrated by these turn of events, Dwayne activates the speed dial number on his phone for the bomb to explode, but finds that Travis altered the numbers while Dwayne was not looking because he was getting nervous about Dwayne's gradually violent attitude. The two head back to Kate's apartment in their masks and kidnap her from the girls' bathroom. Dwayne calls Nick to let him know that he has Kate and if he does not meet at the scrapyard to give him the money, he will kill her. Meanwhile, Chongo breaks into the Major's house to find information regarding Dwayne's location and finds a hand-drawn map to the scrapyard. While there, the Major attacks him with a pen gun and is shot in the stomach after a struggle. Nick arrives at the scrapyard and exchanges the money for Kate. Dwayne gives Nick the code  to deactivate and unbuckle the bomb with minutes to spare. Dwayne then tells Nick to walk away, but Nick deduces that as soon as Nick and Kate turn around, they will just kill them both. Dwayne confirms this by pointing a gun at them while Travis comes out wielding a flamethrower. Nick says he hired a sniper in case this were to happen. This is proved to be fake as it is only Chet who is using a laser pointer, but it is enough to fool Dwayne and Travis into lowering their weapons. Chongo arrives shortly after and knocks Nick out cold, then spots Dwayne and Travis. Despite handing him the money, Chongo holds the two at gun point. Pressured, Travis responds by torching Chongo with the flamethrower. Although burnt to death, Chongo manages to shoot Dwayne in the shoulder and shoot the fuel tank for the flamethrower causing it to explode on Travis's back. Nick quickly wakes up, grabs the money and drives away with Chet and Kate. Still alive, Dwayne spots them running off, but first reconciles with Travis upon putting out the flames on him before heading off. Dwayne catches up to the others with his van, but he hears a beeping sound in the back and the van explodes. Nick reveals that as he grabbed the money, he reactivated the bomb and threw it in the back of the van. Now free with the money in their possession, the three drive off discussing what to do with their newly acquired windfall, but discover that one set has been rigged with dye that sprays Chet in the face. In the post-credits, Dwayne , the Major , Travis, and Juicy are seen in a commercial for Dwayne and Travis' tanning salon business called Major Tan, the cover-up for the prostitution ring Dwayne had been planning.  In the alternate ending, Nick, Chet, and Kate drive off with the money and discuss what they will do with their new found riches. Meanwhile, just miles behind them, Dwayne is revealed to have survived the explosion that occurred moments earlier. Annoyed with his plan's failure, he goes to his father's mansion to see if Chongo killed him. Dwayne finds his dad on the ground suffering from his gunshot wound and tells about his plans for the tanning salon/brothel. His father is excited and tells his son that he is proud of him. The scene changes to a Four Seasons in Atlanta where Kate is managing the special events program. She joins up with Nick and Chet, who are chilling out by the pool enjoying their new lives."

Their injured spy hurriedly arrives to inform them that the devil himself is coming their way. The commander shows immense bravery and commands his army to forge ahead, but within seconds he is killed by a huge dark figure who reveals himself as Kirmada. The king accepts defeat, but Kirmada says he should have done that earlier, and kills him. Terrified, the army flees. King Induverma is seated at his court with Bheem and his ministers, when a messenger of Kirmada arrives. He says Kirmada has ordered Induverma to open Dholakpur's gates the next day and accept defeat, the failure to do which shall seal their fate. Unmoved by his threatening, Bheem says that the next day, just like any other day, Dholakpur would wake up independent. The messenger storms off, saying they would regret it later. The next day, the army of Dholakpur arrives to battle, but to their surprise, there is no army to confront them. Bheem goes to consult the sorceress, who gifts him a magical sword, using which he would be able to defeat Kirmada. Bheem returns to the battlefield and uses the sunlight reflected from the sword to expose Kirmada's army. The battle commences; the army of Dholakpur gains an upper hand with Bheem leading from the front against Kirmada. But as soon as the sun sets, Dholakpur's army loses momentum and king Induverma is captured. Bheem is forced to surrender his sword, he and the surviving army are taken as prisoners of war. Bheem is offered to join Kirmada's army in return for his freedom, but he flatly refuses. He and his friends are sent to the dungeon where they would be fed only once in two days. They manage to fool a guard and steal a metal plate from him, using which they dig a way out of the dungeon, during the course of the next two days. While Bheem, his friends, and the general escape, Kalia, Dholu and Bholu fail to escape in time and they are captured. Bheem and his friends take refuge in a forest. They visit the sage for help, who narrates the history of Kirmada, and instructs Bheem and his friends to pray to Lord Krishna, who would surely help them. A few days have passed, but everything is still the same. Bheem gets tired of the same old routine and goes away to be alone for a while. When he is back, he finds his friends unconscious from consuming some toxic fruits. He hurries to fetch a doctor, but finds his way blocked by a herd of sheep and their shepherd, who reveals himself as Kanha. Bheem tries to fight him out his way, but almost falls off the cliff in the process. Kanha saves Bheem, and says he can save his friends as well. He uses some wild herbs to cure them, and humbly requests to join their circle. Resurrected, they resume their training with their new friend Kanha. Jaggu sees a small group of Kirmada's soldiers heading their way, whom they defeat easily. Kanha sets off to rescue Kalia, Dholu and Bholu . Kanha instructs Kalia to rescue King Induverma, princess Indumati and the soldiers in prison the following day, and lower the flag on the fort when they have completed their task. With Kanha's blessings, Kalia is able to complete his job rather easily. On the other side, Bheem, his friends and Kanha are facing the massive army of Kirmada. Bheem is asked to accept defeat by Kirmada, but at exactly the same time Kalia completes his task and lowers the flag. Kirmada's army is attacked by Dholakpur's army and is defeated with ease. Kirmada goes underground and brings along a Brahmastra given to him by the devil. He hurls the weapon towards Bheem, but Kanha gets in the way. The Brahmastra on coming in contact with Kanha, turns into a garland around his neck. Kanha towers above everyone else in the battlefield, and reveals himself as Lord Krishna. On his command, Bheem finishes off Kirmada using the chariot wheel as Lord Krishna's Sudarshana chakra. The film ends with Krishna telling the viewers that whenever there is injustice and wrongdoing in the world, he will be there. All that needs to be done is remember him, just like Bheem and his friends did. Critics' Take

A man talks to his voice-chatter informing his departure from a local bar. Soon after, Nascimento is shown driving along the road, and he is ambushed by two cars, and the gunmen repeatedly start to blaze his car with bullets. 4 years earlier, Nascimento is shown, now as a Lieutenant Colonel in BOPE, arriving at the Bangu I prison to settle a prison raid, and is shown the few officers being corruptly paid to take them as the hostages. Their leader, Beirada  quickly scouts the prison, killing and burning members of local rival gangs across the prison. BOPE corners them, but they hold back. Beirada orders Nascimento to call Diogo Fraga , a local History teacher, who is at his class. Fraga arrives, and orders Beirada to release the hostages. As soon as Fraga enters in, Nascimento's successor, Cpt. André Matias , who led the group of commandos, flees in and blazes a couple of his men, and Beirada immediately takes Fraga hostage. Matias pretends to lower his gun, but he relents and shoots Beirada and the other men around him, saving Fraga. Afterwards, Fraga, mad about this, embarrasses Nascimento, Matias and the rest of the BOPE squad on the media. This causes Nascimento to be sacked from his work in BOPE, but after he confronts the governor in the restaurant about this, the crowd starts to cheer around him. The governor uses the situation, promoting Nascimento to Deputy Secretary of Intelligence, but Matias is demoted to a Officer Cadet, under the lead of corrupt Cl. Fabio Barbosa , his old friend. Nascimento promises Matias to settle his situation and goes to his supervisor about this, but Matias goes to a journalist named Clara and gives her an interview about disregard of BOPE and the corruption of the governor, almost losing his job. Nascimento confronts Matias about this, and Matias calls him a traitor for taking his position in politics. Meanwhile, Nascimento has his own personal problems. He is divorced, Rosane re-married to none-other than Fraga, and his son, Rafael, is scared of him because of his work, and also Fraga keeps Nascimento away from his son. Nascimento lets this go during his work, and he uses his position to improve BOPE into a police army, organizing dozens of raids across the favelas, ordering armor trucks and a chopper for the team, raising it from 100 policemen to 350 heavy armed police officers divided into 16 tactical teams. Under his influence, BOPE frees the favelas from drug dealers, and also uses the situation to lower the number of corrupt police officers, taking over the favelas from the dealers. Major Sandro Rocha, the lead corrupt boss of the Rio militia and also one of Fabio's men, confronts a few of the dealers. He only gets $500 from the dealers, saying that this is from the pirate TV cable. Rocha kills the rest of the dealers and devises a new plan; Instead of using the dealers as the middle-man, he uses the favelas and opens the business of money laundering and protection racket trades, earning his share in favelas by providing internet, cable TV, banks, cafes, restaurants, every business and acts as a protection to them, taking big income. In the next 4 years, Rocha grows up into a powerful militia leader, killing competition, witnesses, business owners who refuse to pay and even further. He grows his own corrupt army of militia in the favelas, with BOPE unwillingly helping them by securing the favelas from the drug dealers. In present time, Rafael grew up and started working for Fraga, and he is still the deputy. Fraga is now a politician, retiring from his job as a teacher. One day, several men raid the police station, stealing dozens of guns with them from the armory. The chief suspects that this could be militia, as they were using references that dealers don't use and they were wearing military boots, but Fabio assures the Secretary that these are the drug dealers, saying that he got this from a reliable source. Rocha also uses his power to bring Matias back into BOPE, weakening Nascimento's power. Nascimento records over 300 hours of phone calls with dealers, with evidence that the dealers know nothing about the guns, but the Secretary orders him to schedule the attack on the last favela. Nascimento plans the attack, but he is concerned about the corrupt officers. Matias devises the plan; He and rest of the BOPE team will arrive dressed as patrol officers and replace the corrupt officers in the police station. The next day, BOPE team arrives and attacks the dealers. They try to block their way, but they easily overpower the dealers, forcing them back. Dealers try to run across the station, expecting corrupt officers to let them pass, but Matias and the rest of the team arrive outside and wipe the remaining dealers. Just then, Fabio, Rocha and rest of the men arrive as backup, and the main dealer escapes through the alleyways, but Matias manages to subdue him. Matias tortures him for the information, but the dealer keeps telling that they didn't steal the guns. Rocha, along with Fabio, arrives and immediately shoots the dealer in the chest, killing him. Matias orders the rest of the BOPE soldiers to carry away the dealer's body, and then he confronts Rocha. Matias tells Rocha that he could manage to get the information, as doubts about the guns being at the dealer's favelas, and orders Rocha and Fabio to give him the source's name by the rest of the day. He storms off in anger, but Rocha shoots him in the back, murdering Matias. Fabio confronts Rocha about this, but Rocha orders his units to give them a 15-minute window, then reporting his death, and also assuring that he wasn't with Matias when he was killed, placing a detailed story that two oncoming bullets killed him. Nascimento confronts Fabio on Matias' funeral, and he promises him that he will find the murderer. Concerned, Nascimento uses his power to listen to calls from Fraga's phone, because of Fraga's influence in the politics. Meanwhile, Clara the journalist tries to make a story, and goes into one of Rocha's favelas to make a story about corrupt officers. She goes to an apartment ran by an old lady to give her an interview, unaware that she has been paid by Rocha as an informant, and she stalks them and makes a call to Rocha about this. He arrives with his men, killing the reporter and raping and killing Clara. Rocha takes Clara's phone and burns it, but not before hearing Fraga on the phone, realizing that she has been talking to Fraga, who is shocked by this events. Nascimento also hears this and records the data, taking it with him. Just after he leaves, the Secretary orders Fraga's phone to be wired, but he already realizes that Nascimento ordered this. Meanwhile, Nascimento desperately tries to call Rosane, and he waits at her apartment. Fraga, Rafael and Rosane arrive, and Nascimento tries to warn them about Rocha's orders, but two guys on a scooter arrive, performing a drive-by on Fraga's car, shooting Rafael. Nascimento shoots one of the men and leaves with the trio, rushing Rafael to the emergency room. The next night, after the surgery on Rafael , he confronts Rosane, telling her to call him if she needs anything. The beginning of the movie is shown with Nascimento leaving the hospital. Just then, Rocha and his men arrive and try to kill Nascimento, but he already had a backup car behind him, with armed BOPE soldiers. He manages to defend himself from Rocha's men, who escape after a failed attack. Nascimento takes his men and confronts the Secretary, beating him and threatening that he will kill him and the rest of his corrupt men if anything ever happens to his son. The next day, he shows up on the trial in Brasília that has been organized, and he testifies with Fraga for three long hours at the court, also regarding to dismiss BOPE. In the aftermath, the governor is sentenced to a longtime sentence in prison, the Secretary is placed as the new governor, Fraga is still trying to enroll himself deeper in the politics, and many witnesses are killed so the militia officers can protect themselves. Rocha is also killed on Fabio's orders, with his body dumped into the sea. Nascimento ends his narration with the words: ""And who is paying for all this? It must be expensive. Real expensive. That is the system, it's tough."""

Nick works at a financial firm for the sadistic David Harken, who dangles the possibility of a promotion in front of Nick, only to award it to himself. Dale is a dental assistant being sexually harassed by his boss, Dr. Julia Harris; she threatens to tell his fiancee  that he had sex with her unless he actually has sex with her. Nick and Dale's accountant friend Kurt Buckman enjoys working for Jack Pellitt  but after Jack dies, the company is taken over by Jack's cocaine-addicted, amoral son Bobby. At night, over drinks, Kurt jokingly suggests that their lives would be happier if their bosses were no longer around. Initially hesitant, they eventually agree to do away with their employers. In search of a hitman, the trio meet Dean ""Motherfucker"" Jones , an ex-con who agrees to be their ""murder consultant"". Jones suggests that Dale, Kurt and Nick kill each other's bosses to hide their motive while making the deaths look like accidents. The three reconnoiter Bobby's house, and Kurt steals Bobby's phone. They next go to Harken's house. Kurt and Nick go inside while Dale waits in the car. Harken returns home and confronts Dale for littering, but then has an allergy attack from the peanut butter on the litter. Dale saves Harken by stabbing him with an EpiPen. Nick and Kurt think Dale is stabbing Harken to death and flee, Kurt accidentally dropping Bobby's phone in Harken's bedroom. Harken's wife Rhonda  thanks Dale for saving her husband, causing Harken to jealously accuse her of having an affair with Dale. The next night, Kurt watches Julia's home, but she seduces and has sex with him. Nick and Dale wait outside Bobby's and Harken's houses to commit the murders. Harken discovers Bobby's cellphone in his bedroom and uses it to find his address, suspecting Rhonda is having another affair. He drives over and kills Bobby, with Nick as a secret witness. Nick flees at high speed, setting off a traffic camera. The three friends meet to discuss their reservations about continuing with their plan. They are arrested by the police, who feel the camera footage makes them suspects in Bobby's murder. Lacking evidence, the police are forced to let the trio go free. They consult with Jones again, but learn that he has never actually killed anyone, having been imprisoned for bootlegging the film Snow Falling on Cedars. They decide their only option is to get Harken to confess and secretly tape it. The three accidentally crash Harken's surprise birthday party. Nick and Dale get Harken to confess to the murder before realizing that Kurt, who has the audio recorder, is elsewhere having sex with Rhonda. Harken threatens to kill all three for attempting to blackmail him. They flee by car. Harken gives chase, ramming their vehicle. Kurt asks his car's navigation-system operator to help get them out of trouble. Believing they have committed a crime, the operator remotely disables Kurt's car, allowing Harken to catch and hold them at gunpoint. Harken shoots himself in the leg as he boasts about his plan to frame them for murdering Bobby and attempting to kill him to get rid of the witness. The police arrest Nick, Dale and Kurt, but the navigation-system operator reveals that the entire conversation was recorded. Harken is sentenced to 25 years to life in prison, while the friends get their charges waived. Nick is promoted to president of the company under an abusive CEO , Kurt retains his job under a new boss, and Dale blackmails Julia into ending her harassment by convincing her to sexually harass a supposedly unconscious patient while Jones secretly records the act."

She explains that her father and brother had sexually abused her for years, and that Martin saw her kill their father in self-defense. Her cousin Anita smuggled her out of the island and let her live under her identity. Finally free of her brother, she returns to Sweden and tearfully reunites with Henrik. As promised, Henrik gives Blomkvist the information on Wennerström, but it proves to be worthless. Salander hacks into Wennerström's computer and presents Blomkvist with damning evidence of Wennerström's crimes. Blomkvist publishes an article which ruins Wennerström, who flees the country. Salander hacks into Wennerström's bank accounts and, travelling to Switzerland in disguise, transfers two billion euros to various accounts. Wennerström is soon found murdered. Salander reveals to her former guardian that she is in love with Blomkvist. On her way to give Blomkvist a Christmas present, however, Salander sees him and his longtime lover and business partner Erika Berger  walking together happily. Heartbroken, she discards the gift and rides away.

However, they are betrayed by Milady, who gives the blueprints to the Duke of Buckingham . Upon returning to France, the Musketeers are forced to disband by Cardinal Richelieu  for their failure, and they end up on the streets of Paris. One year later, a young man named D'Artagnan  leaves his village in Gascony for Paris in hopes of becoming a Musketeer as his father was, only to learn that they no longer exist. At a rural bar, D'Artagnan accuses Captain Rochefort , the leader of Richelieu's guard, of offending his horse, and challenges him to a duel. Rochefort shoots him while he is distracted but he is saved by Milady de Winter. Arriving in Paris, D'Artagnan by coincidence separately encounters Athos, Porthos and Aramis accidentally offending all three scheduling duels with each at 12:00, 1:00 and 2:00&nbsp;pm respectively. Athos brings Porthos and Aramis to the duel as his seconds. D'Artagnan realises they are the Musketeers he is seeking. He is prepared to continue with the duel but Richelieu's guards break it up. The three are inspired by D'Artagnan and fight together and defeat the soldiers, but later are summoned before the young King Louis XIII ([[Freddie Fox  and his wife, Queen Anne . Richelieu asks the king to execute the four, but the queen is impressed by their bravery and the king congratulates them and invites them to an event, which to Athos' anger, turns out to be Buckingham's arrival  Later, Richelieu orders Milady, who is actually working for him, to plant false love letters among Queen Anne's possessions, steal Queen Anne's diamond necklace, and take it to the Tower of London to frame Queen Anne as having an affair with the Duke of Buckingham. The affair would force King Louis to execute Queen Anne and declare war on England. At this point, the people would demand a more experienced leader: Richelieu himself. But Milady demands that Richelieu declare in writing that she is working on behalf of France, to protect herself in case of palace intrigue. The false letters  are found by a maid and are given to King Louis and he is advised by Richelieu to set up a ball at which Queen Anne would be forced to wear the necklace. If she doesn't, then her affair is real, and there will be war against England. Queen Anne's lady-in-waiting Constance Bonacieux  discovers Richelieu's plan and asks the Musketeers to stop him. At the dock, Constance takes D'Artagnan's hat, cape and horse to create a diversion of the guards standing in front of the boat. At Calais, they find guards and Constance pretends to be d'Artagnan and distracts the guards while the musketeers get on a boat. In London, Milady warns Buckingham that the Musketeers have arrived to take revenge on him. Milady instructs Buckingham of all their tendencies in battle, but Athos predicts this and the Musketeers resolve to do just the opposite. Milady later escapes in a coach, taking the necklace with her. Buckingham captures D'Artagnan, but he was a decoy to let the Musketeers steal the airship. The Musketeers rescue D'Artagnan, demolishing the top floor of the Tower in the process. Meanwhile, the coach stops in a clearing in the woods and the driver is revealed to be Planchet, the Musketeer's servant and occasional helper. The musketeers pick up the coach and capture Milady. She gives up Richelieu's authorisation to try to save her life. When Athos intends to kill her anyway, she jumps out of the airship into the English Channel to spare him from having to pull the trigger. The Musketeers return to Paris with the necklace, but in the air near the city they are attacked by Rochefort in another airship, as Milady had given Richelieu copies of da Vinci's blueprints. D'Artagnan agrees to exchange the necklace for Constance, with whom he is infatuated, but Rochefort knocks him out and captures him as soon as the necklace is in his possession. Rochefort then proceeds to attack the Musketeers' ship, at first gaining the upper hand due to the superior weaponry and armor of his airship. However, the Musketeers lure Rochefort into a storm cloud, burst the balloon of airship and make the ship crash into the Notre Dame Cathedral. On the roof, D'Artagnan duels and stabs Rochefort, who falls to his death. Meanwhile, Constance returns the necklace to Queen Anne. The Musketeers arrive at the ball in Buckingham's now burning airship. However, for the sake of King Louis and his people, they claim that Richelieu had it built for the king, but an attempt was made by Rochefort to sabotage it, also showing King Louis the authorisation Richelieu had given Milady, pretending that it was given to them. Richelieu, impressed by how the Musketeers handled the situation, offers them places in his employ, but they refuse. At sea, Milady  is rescued by Buckingham, who reveals that he knows that she was working for Richelieu and says that he is going to fight against France. The camera backs away and shows Buckingham advancing towards France's shore with a massive fleet of battleships and airships.

Fanny Hawthorn  is seen packing her suitcase in preparation for her trip to Blackpool with her friend Mary Hollins . Meanwhile Allan Jeffcote , son of the owner of the mill in which Fanny works, and employed in the offices, has had his own holiday plans disrupted due to his fiancée having to cancel their arrangements at the last minute. After a final day's work, the factory hooter sounds and Fanny and Mary board the excursion train to Blackpool, while Allan and a friend decide to travel there by car. In the bustle and throng of Blackpool in peak season, Fanny and Mary meet up with Allan and his friend and enjoy the excitement of the resort as a foursome. Allan and Fanny are attracted to each other, and Allan persuades Fanny to leave Blackpool and instead accompany him for a stay in the more upmarket resort of Llandudno in North Wales. Knowing what this entails, Fanny agrees and writes a postcard to her parents, which Mary promises to post from Blackpool later in the week. Soon after, Mary is tragically killed in a boating accident. When Fanny's father hears the news he travels to Blackpool, only to find Fanny not there, and the unmailed postcard in Mary's luggage. At the end of the week, Fanny and Allan return separately to Hindle, where Fanny, previously unaware of Mary's death and shocked by the news, is interrogated by her parents and reveals that she has spent the week with Allan in Llandudno. In indignation, the Hawthorns go to the Jeffcote home and confront Allan's parents with his caddish behaviour. To their surprise, they find Allan's father equally appalled by the situation. Mr. Jeffcote determines that Allan must marry Fanny in order to prevent a scandal. Allan initially opposes his father's demand but explains the situation to his fiancée, who insists that in the circumstances the only decent thing for him to do is to comply with the insistence that he marry Fanny after having compromised her reputation. That evening the Hawthorns visit the Jeffcotes to make arrangements for the marriage. Fanny registers her defiance by refusing to dress up and insisting on wearing her working clothes. Allan makes a formal offer of marriage, and to everyone's amazement Fanny turns him down flat, saying that she is just as entitled to enjoy a ""little fancy"" as any man. Allan and his fiancée resume their engagement, while Fanny moves out of the family home to get away from the wrath of her mother. She strikes up a friendship with a fellow mill worker, and agrees to a date with him."

Acheson has spent years hunting Elise's old lover, Alexander Pearce, who owes £744 million in back taxes and is believed to have received 20 million dollars worth of plastic surgery to alter his appearance completely. At a cafe, Elise receives written instructions from Pearce: board a train to Venice, pick out a man who resembles Pearce, and make the police believe that this decoy is Pearce himself. Elise burns the note, then manages to evade the police and board the train. On the train, Elise picks Frank Tupelo, a U.S. community college teacher. She spends much time with him, seeming to start a romance. In the meanwhile, the police have managed to salvage the ashes of her burned note and assembled them to extract information regarding her rendezvous as well as her ruse. But an informer from the police station mistakenly communicates to Reginald Shaw, a gangster from whom Pearce as accountant stole $2.3 billion, that Pearce is travelling with Elise on the train to Venice. Shaw immediately proceeds to Venice. Elise invites Frank to stay with her at the hotel room that has been arranged for her in Venice. Pearce leaves further instructions for Elise to attend a ball. Elise abandons Frank, who is then chased by Shaw's men. While trying to escape from them, Frank is detained by the Italian police ostensibly for his own safety, only to have a corrupt inspector turn him over to Shaw's men in exchange for the bounty that has been placed on Pearce's head. Elise rescues Frank just before he is handed over, leading Shaw's men on an extended boat chase and escaping. She leaves Frank at the airport with his passport and money, urging him to go home for his own safety. Elise is revealed to be one of Scotland Yard's agents who may have become Pearce's ally. Because of her fears for Frank, she agrees to participate in a sting operation. At the ball, as Elise wanders around trying to spot Pearce in the crowd, an envelope is placed on the table in front of her by a man who then quickly disappears into the crowd. Elise sees that the envelope is for her, and believes that the man must be Pearce himself. She tries to follow him through the crowd, calling out his name, but is stopped by Frank who has managed to enter inside under a pretext. Frank claims to be in love with her, and invites her to dance with him. But he is hauled away by the police, while Elise opens the envelope and finds a note mentioning a rendezvous point. She then heads off in her boat to this new rendezvous point. Shaw and his men tail her in their boat; both parties are followed discreetly by the police boat in which Frank is held handcuffed to stop him from obstructing the investigation. When Elise arrives at the destination, Shaw takes her prisoner, threatening to harm her unless she reveals the location of the stolen money. The police monitor the situation inside the rendezvous room through audio and video links. Despite Elise's peril, Acheson repeatedly turns down police requests to intervene with their snipers. While the police are occupied in monitoring the situation, Frank escapes from the police boat and confronts Shaw, claiming to be Pearce who has undergone plastic surgery and offering to open the safe if Elise is allowed to leave safely. Shaw is skeptical and makes a counter offer that Frank should open the safe if he does not want to see Elise being cut up. Chief Inspector Jones  arrives at the police stake-out, overrides Acheson, and orders the police snipers to fire into the room, killing Shaw and his men. Jones lifts Elise's suspension and also terminates her employment. Acheson receives a radio message that Pearce has been found not far from the rendezvous point, and rushes to the location where police have detained the suspect. But the man claims to be just a tourist who has merely been following instructions texted to his mobile phone, to be present at certain locations, for which he has been receiving payments. Meanwhile, Elise tells Frank that she loves him, but she also loves Pearce. Frank then suggests a ""solution"" to this dilemma; to Elise's surprise, he opens the safe by entering the correct code, thus revealing that he is really Alexander Pearce. He and Elise then take the money and depart, leaving a cheque in the safe for the full amount of the taxes he owes. The police find the cheque when they return and blow the safe open. Acheson now realizes that Frank has indeed been Pearce all along, and wants to pursue him; but Jones determines that, with the taxes now paid fully, Pearce's only crime is that he stole money from a now-dead gangster. Jones orders the case to be closed. Frank and Elise sail away to a new life together, with Elise taking in and getting used to the new and completely altered face of her old lover."

In the ancient time until the 60s this was the most fertile land but now it's slums inhabitant by all kinds of people. The town is close to Maddi an upper-class neighborhood and the local calls ""the American Neignobourhood"". The Nile runs through it. The city is one of the many slums that surround Cairo. In twenty minutes a person can leave old Cairo, the slums of Cairo that look like a medieval places to Zamalak or Maddi with their westernized hotels, houses and internet cafes. It's precisely the journey of the main Character, Amal, through Cairo from the slums, to modern Cairo, to Coptic and Islamic Cairo. This journey in the bewildering chaos of the city, the visual turmoil and disorder of color is all part of the frame in Cairo Exit. In this story everyone wants to leave and everyone has a secret of his or her own. Cairo is a city of layers, ancient civilizations crumbled over each other, covered by modern way of life. The challenge is to capture the light and dark contrasts of the city with fresh eyes— to create a visceral, immediate experience for audiences, immersing them in the sweltering heat and small alleyways. Since we're shooting in the heart of the city's infamous but rarely explored slums, capturing their energy and urgency on-the-fly, with an unforced realism. By using a hand-held camera to reflect the urgency of the city, the disorder of details and to activate the perception of loneliness for the characters. With a distilled narrative and a closely attentive camera, the story offer up characters, often members of what might be called the struggling classes, who are humanized through their daily choices. Though the film is scrupulously naturalistic, in lighting, camera work, sound design, still somehow it belongs to the suspense genre, though it is suspense of character, not of plot. It is not so much a question of what will happen next, as of how the characters arrive, or fail to arrive, at a decision to act. The Camera and the natural lighting will capture the rhythms of life and the raw reality of the streets. Using caressing natural light, early morning breath, orange tone for the city, dusty green for the in doors locations like the house of Amal. Earthy colors from most of the characters and capturing the neon blue, red and green lights that sweep Cairo at night. The whole film is a constant discovery, each new image striking our eye in a fresh way; the impression unfolds before us. Another key feature is the moving between indoors and out doors location, completely objective, where the camera just happened to be. The main character and the main focal of the story is Amal Iskander a poor 18-year-old Coptic Egyptian girl. Her Muslim boyfriend Tarek is planning to leave Egypt on an illegal boat-crossing to Italy. Amal tells Tarek she is pregnant but he gives her an ultimatum - abandon the country with him, or have an abortion. Amal, who loves Tarek and wants the baby, rejects both choices. But when the battered scooter she uses for food deliveries is stolen. Amal is fired from her job and suddenly finds herself with even fewer options. Her future, limited from the start, looks even more uncertain. In the poor neighborhood of Bashtel where Amal lives with her mother and a stepfather who is a compulsive gambler, day-to-day existence is difficult for everyone. Her sister, Hanan, is also an unwed mother with few paths to a better life. Her best friend, Rania, is trying to raise money for an operation that will disguise the fact that she is no longer a virgin so that she can marry an wealthy, older man whom she does not love. Amal seeks guidance in prayers to the Virgin Mary, but with few real possibilities left, she takes the only job she can find - in a hairdresser with low pay. The new job opens up the underworld life within Cairo that Amal never imagined - a life of luxury, leisure, expensive homes and cars - but also one of vice. At one of her destinations, a high class brothel in an exclusive part of town, she discovers her sister Hanan working as a prostitute in order to support her child. Devastated, disgusted by the life of the underworld, she gives up her only possibility for self-sufficiency. Neither desiring a loveless marriage like Rania's, nor wishing to end up destitute like her mother and sister, Amal decides that she must abandon her family and their difficult existence in Egypt to join the man she loves and take the risky journey across the sea to another life."

Upstanding and respectable inhabitants find themselves and their loved ones accused in lascivious detail of all manner of moral, sexual and criminal misdeeds. The Reverend Rider  and his sister Mary  attempt to defuse the increasing consternation of the villagers by pointing out that the letters are motivated by malice and a desire to stir up trouble, and should be ignored as the nonsense they are. Their efforts meet with little success, and Rider's daughter Ann  also becomes a target with lewd accusations being made about her fiancé David .

The letters all bear the local postmark, and people start to look suspiciously at their friends and neighbours, wondering who could be behind the campaign. Despite Rider's insistence that the contents of the letters should be disregarded, some notice that the letter-writer seems to have a very detailed knowledge of their personal circumstances, and start to question whether there may be a grain of truth in what is being written. Personal relationships too come under strain. Soon the entire village is overtaken by suspicion and paranoia, and fingers start to point at Connie Fateley , a shy young seamstress who lives alone and does not tend to socialise.

Seattle police officers Madam Yeung Lai-ching , Donnie Yen, and their Caucasian partner Peter Woods tail a group of Chinese cocaine dealers through a mall. Madam Yeung and Peter tail them to a seaport that night, where a shipment has just arrived from Hong Kong. Chinese workmen load crates into the drug dealers' truck. Madam Yeung, in defiance of Peter, acrobatically infiltrates the docks and enters the truck, but is caught by one of the workmen, Luk Wan-ting . She convinces him that she's a stowaway illegal immigrant from Hong Kong, and he takes her to his nearby attic apartment, where he gives her some money to help her, as he and his brother too were illegal immigrants for seven years. He has just obtained legal ID cards for both of them. She tries to stealthily check in with Peter, who is tailing the cocaine dealers to an unknown location, but Luk grows suspicious and catches her. Just then Luk's brother Ming  crashes in through a skylight, pursued by six armed thugs to whom he owes $20,000 due to his gambling addiction. Luk attacks the thugs to save Ming, revealing that he has some martial arts skill. Madam Yeung joins the fight against the thugs. Together they drive the thugs away. She returns Luk's money and leaves. The next morning, Madam Yeung realizes that one of the Chinese cocaine dealers is following her. She ambushes him, and they fight. He has some martial arts skill, but not as much as her. After a minute he gives up and flees by jumping off a hundred-foot tower into the harbor. Meanwhile, Donnie tails one of the cocaine dealers to a restaurant, where his friend Captain Michael Wong happens to be having breakfast with a girl. He comes over to say hi to Donnie, inadvertently obscuring Donnie's view as the cocaine dealer leaves. Both of them run outside in search of the criminal, but are ambushed by a couple martial artists. Donnie easily beats up both thugs and arrests them. Elsewhere, Peter has tailed the cocaine dealers to a mining corporation warehouse on the docks, where they sell cocaine to a Caucasian gang. Peter attempts to arrest them all, revealing that the Caucasians' leader is a CIA officer named Mr. Robinson, which the Hong Kong dealers didn't know. He photographs Mr. Robinson in the act of the cocaine deal. Mr. Robinson draws a concealed shotgun and shoots Peter in the torso, and then he and his men shoot all the Chinese dealers dead . They try to retrieve the camera, but Peter is still alive, and he flees the warehouse even as Mr. Robinson shoots him again. Outside, he crashes into Luk, hands him his gun and the negative of the photo, and tells him to give it to the police. Then Mr. Robinson and his men catch up and shoot him dead. They open fire at Luk too, but Luk flees behind a shed and accidentally drops the negative into the ocean. Mr. Robinson and his men continue to pursue Luk and shoot at him, but Luk is rescued at the last moment by the arrival of the Seattle police. Mr. Robinson and his men jump into their car and escape. Madam Yeung, Donnie, and the other officers drive up and find their partner's corpse and Luk with a gun. They arrest Luk. At the Seattle police station, Donnie interrogates Luk, thinking he was a member of the Hong Kong gang and convinced that he hid the negative somewhere, while Luk proclaims his innocence. Donnie's interrogation is interrupted by a higher ranking officer, and Donnie leaves the interrogation room. The new officer threatens Luk to give him the negative, and brutally beats him with a baton when he claims he doesn't know where it is. Luk defends himself and knocks out the corrupt officer, then puts on his uniform and sneaks out of the police station. Luk goes to Ming's apartment, and Ming gives up his ID card, which Luk worked for seven years to get him, to get $3000 for a seat on a ship to take Luk back to Hong Kong that night. It is revealed that Luk is skilled at repairing Ming's TV antenna. Just then a couple of gunmen enter the apartment in search of Luk. Ming sacrifices his life to save Luk, while Luk keeps trying to save Ming until he dies, then finally flees. Just as Luk reaches the apartment complex's exit, Madam Yeung and Donnie pull up outside, having come to arrest him. Luk runs back in. Madam Yeung and Donnie split up to search the apartment complex. Donnie sees Luk and chases him onto the rooftop, where Luk ambushes him, and they fight. Donnie almost immediately gets the advantage and beats up Luk, who flees, jumping from rooftops with Donnie in hot pursuit. Luk jumps onto a Budget truck and rides it away. Donnie, still convinced that Luk is a cocaine dealer, draws his gun and takes aim, but Madam Yeung appears and knocks it away to save the potentially innocent Luk, who escapes. Back at the Seattle police station, Donnie's superior orders him off the case because he has no faith in him, and replaces him with Michael. Donnie requests to stay on the case as Michael's partner, and Michael convinces their superior to allow it. That night, Luk goes to board the ship to Hong Kong. He has to sell his ID card as well to buy passage. Donnie gets information that Luk escaped to Hong Kong on that ship, and he, Michael, and Madam Yeung fly to Hong Kong, arriving before the ship. When the ship reaches port, the Hong Kong police board it to arrest Luk. Luk flees to the other side of the ship and jumps off onto a cargo dock, then lies atop a giant cargo container as a forklift carries it through the police barrier. Donnie climbs atop a tall stack of cargo containers and sees Luk escape. Luk goes to a phone booth and calls his mother, who lives in Hong Kong, to tell her that he's returned and will see her soon. Donnie catches up with him and chases him to a beach, where they fight. Madam Yeung arrives and yells at Donnie to stop beating Luk, finally pointing her gun at him. Donnie knocks her gun into the ocean, and she attacks him. Their fight is broken up by Michael and the Hong Kong police, and Luk is arrested again. Michael, Madam Yeung, and a Hong Kong police officer ride with Luk toward the Hong Kong police station in the back of an ambulance. Madam Yeung interrogates Luk, who tells her that a Seattle police officer attacked him in the station. Michael tries to convince Luk to let him extradite him back to the U.S. Just then a large blue truck pulls up alongside them, and two thugs, one of them played by John Salvitti, jump from it onto the roof of the ambulance. Salvitti swings around and kicks through the driver's window, knocking out the driver and taking his place. The other thug throws a gas bomb through the window into the back. The gas knocks out Michael, Luk, and the Hong Kong police officer, but Madam Yeung grabs the ambulance's inhaler and uses it to avoid the gas until the thug breaks in through the rear doors. She kicks him out, and he climbs back onto the roof. She climbs up after him, and they fight on the roof of the speeding ambulance. He kicks her off, but she does a 720 degree backflip, kicks through the side windows, and hangs upside down by her feet, her head almost striking the road. She struggles to get back up, but he kicks her down again, and she clings to the ambulance, her dragging feet almost getting sucked under the rear wheels. He climbs down and kicks her repeatedly, but she manages to pull herself up and kick him away, then climb over to the broken driver's window and attack Salvitti. Salvitti draws a gun and opens fire at her, and she ends up falling off the front of the ambulance and clinging to the grill, her feet dragging on the road underneath the ambulance. Salvitti speeds forward and attempts to crush her between the ambulance and the rear of the blue truck, but she manages to climb free enough to throw herself out of the way and roll out on the road behind the vehicles as they escape with Luk and Michael as captives. Madam Yeung organizes a Hong Kong police search team for them. Meanwhile, Luk and Michael are tortured by being tied up in a freezer. A thug played by Paul Wong interrogates, beats, and further tortures them, seeking the negative. Michael manages to free himself from his bonds and knock out the thug, then free Luk. Michael tries to convince Luk to give him the negative, and Luk begins to tell him about it, but they're interrupted by the arrival of a thug played by Michael Woods. Luk and Michael get separated, and Luk hides in a parked car. Michael meets up with three thugs - John Salvitti, Michael Woods, and Stephan Berwick. It is revealed that he is their boss. Meanwhile, Luk uses his electronics skills to get the car's radio working, and he contacts the Hong Kong police headquarters, who locate the signal's source and come to rescue him. Then Michael finds Luk and asks for the negative again. Luk tells him that he lost the negative, and he doesn't know where, but he saw the murderer of the American cop and could recognize him. Michael surreptitiously reaches for his gun, but just then Madam Yeung and the Hong Kong police arrive. They take Luk back into custody, and Michael declares that he's going to extradite him back to the U.S. Madam Yeung drives Luk toward the airport to be flown back to the U.S. On the way, Luk requests to see his mother before leaving. Madam Yeung is reluctantly convinced, and she drives Luk to his mother's home, where they have an emotional conversation as Luk and his mother are overjoyed to see each other, but Luk's mother is devastated by learning that he is suspected of a crime severe enough to involve U.S. police. They also meet up with Donnie. Madam Yeung, Luk, and Donnie walk outside and are attacked by Salvitti, who rides up on a motorcycle and opens fire with an automatic rifle, shooting Luk in the heart. Madam Leung and Donnie carry Luk and flee. Donnie lures Salvitti away while Madam Leung gets Luk to the nearest hospital. Donnie ambushes Salvitti and fights him. Salvitti is almost a match for him, but Donnie manages to beat him up and arrest him. The next morning, at the hospital, Luk is unconscious but past the most dangerous period and will likely recover. Madam Yeung and Donnie argue, with Donnie accusing Madam Yeung of too much sentimentality, particularly for having let Luk see his mother and thereby exposing him to danger, and Madam Yeung accusing Donnie of too much impulsiveness and egotistical attitude. Then Madam Yeung's superior enters the room and berates her for granting Luk's request, but Donnie defends her by claiming responsibility for the decision. Afterward she tries to thank him, but he avoids her. Michael meets with the Chinese cocaine dealer and tells him that his cocaine and Michael's money were both lost to the police, but he promises revenge. The dealer drives off, accompanied by a tough-looking Caucasian woman . Later, at the Hong Kong police headquarters, Donnie interrogates Salvitti while Madam Yeung and Michael watch. Donnie reveals that Salvitti has a distinctive tattoo on his forearm, which he explains is a sign of the Field Troop of the U.S. Navy – the symbol of Black Fox, Troop 3. According to the Pentagon's records, on October 26, 1979, was entirely destroyed in the civil war of Nicaragua, but a suspect killed in this case in the U.S. the previous month also had this tattoo. Salvitti taunts Donnie, who brutally beats him. Salvitti surreptitiously injects himself with a concealed needle and dies, making it look like he died from Donnie's beating. Later that day, Michael takes Donnie to the airport, telling him the Hong Kong police complained that Donnie's violence caused Salvitti's death, so Michael has to transfer him back to Seattle. Donnie tricks Michael into thinking he's left, but then doubles back, suspicious. That night, Michael takes Madam Yeung to dinner at a nice restaurant, and the Chinese cocaine dealer plants a bomb under her car. Madam Yeung narrowly avoids the explosion and attacks the dealer, but his female bodyguard drives up and rescues him, and they escape. Later that night, Stephan Berwick rappels down the outside of the hospital and shoots what he thinks is Luk with an automatic rifle through the window, but it's a decoy dummy, and the doctors in the room reveal themselves to be disguised Hong Kong policemen, and they draw their guns and return fire. Berwick flees. Madam Yeung sends the officers after him, then goes to the room where Luk actually is and checks up on him. He's still unconscious. The room is attacked by Paul Wong, who takes Madam Yeung by surprise and stabs her in the neck with a tranquilizer syringe, then draws a large knife and attacks her as she struggles to stay awake. The doctor tries to interfere, but Paul stabs him to death, cuts Madam Yeung, and knocks her out of the way. He tries to kill the unconscious Luk, but Madam Yeung saves him for a few more seconds. Finally he knocks her back again and she's too close to unconsciousness to move, but at the last moment Donnie bursts into the room and attacks Paul. They fight briefly before Donnie kills him. The next morning, Madam Yeung is recuperating in a church along with Donnie and the still-unconscious Luk. She asks him why he didn't return to the U.S., and he explains that he felt something was wrong about the death of Salvitti. She knows that he suspects Michael is one of the criminals, but he doesn't want to admit it, as they're good friends. They argue, but then come to an understanding. Just then Luk wakes and explains all that happened from his perspective. Later that day, Madam Yeung's superior orders her to let Michael take Luk back to the U.S. Madam Yeung secretly organizes a Hong Kong police raid of the Chinese drug dealers' lab, but tells Michael, who comes with her, that they're just going to get Luk. They enter the lab, and a huge gunfight breaks out. Madam Yeung pursues the ringleader into a metal stairwell and kills him. His female bodyguard attacks her, and they have a long and brutal fight. Finally the female bodyguard falls down an elevator shaft to her death, despite Madam Yeung's last-minute attempt to save her. As a consequence of Madam Yeung's insubordinate actions, the Hong Kong police chief is forced to declare her under arrest. However, she hasn't returned with Michael. Meanwhile, back at the church, Luk identifies Mr. Robinson to Donnie, who recognizes him as a CIA officer. Madam Yeung goes to Luk's mother's house. There she is ambushed by Michael Woods and Stephan Berwick, who beat her up and capture her, having already abducted Luk's mother. She's rescued by the arrival of a Hong Kong police squad, who chase Michael and Stephan away. One officer stays behind to arrest Madam Yeung, but she knocks him out and flees. Donnie confronts Michael about his suspicions. Michael reveals that he is a CIA officer, and that his division, which includes Mr. Robinson, sells drugs to raise money in order to support a Latin American anti-government force, which is in the U.S.'s political interests. He invites Donnie to join them. Donnie refuses, and Michael reveals a deadly syringe concealed in his shoe and unleashes a flurry of quick, vicious kicks at Donnie, who avoids them all and starts to gain the advantage until Michael draws a gun. Donnie flees on foot into the streets, but the hidden tape on which he recorded Michael's confession is destroyed. Michael sees that there was a tape, but doesn't realize it's broken. Michael sends Woods and Berwick after Donnie on motorcycles. Donnie narrowly avoids them for a brief, stunt-filled chase, and then he jumps up and kicks Berwick off his motorcycle and steals it. A long motorcycle chase and fight ensues between him and Woods throughout the streets, hills, and obstacle-filled back alleys of Hong Kong. Finally Donnie gains the advantage, but Woods escapes. Donnie meets up with Madam Yeung, but Michael has framed Donnie for a crime, and now both of them are pursued by the police in a desperate foot chase through a parking garage. They hide in a car trunk, but are found by the Hong Kong police chief. However, the chief conceals them and lets them go, warning them that he can't help them a second time. Back in the church, Donnie, Madam Yeung, and Luk re-convene, and Madam Yeung reveals that Luk's mother has been abducted. Luk re-bandages his chest wound and prepares to go rescue her. On Madam Yeung's suggestion, they call Michael and offer to trade the incriminating tape for Luk's mother. Madam Yeung, Donnie, and Luk walk into Michael's building as Michael watches them on a security camera. A steel gate crashes down behind them. They meet with Michael and his sadistic Chinese bodyguard. Donnie throws the tape to Michael, who catches it, then draws a gun to kill them all. Madam Yeung draws a remote trigger switch and declares that the ""tape"" Michael is holding is a bomb. She makes Michael unload his gun and throw it away, and Luk demands the return of his mother. On Michael's order, his bodyguard opens a blind to reveal that Luk's mother is hanging from ropes outside a grated window, still alive. Luk charges at the window, but it's electrified, and he's thrown to the floor, shocked. Using this distraction, Michael leaps forward and attacks Donnie and Madam Leung. Berwick appears and attacks Madam Leung, and Michael focuses on Donnie. Luk gets up and tries to break the electrified window to reach his mother, but the Chinese bodyguard attacks him with skilled kicks. Three simultaneous fights ensue. Donnie kicks Michael down a staircase and pursues him away from the others. The Chinese bodyguard brutally beats the outmatched Luk, reopening his chest wound. Madam Leung and Berwick have an intense back-and-forth fight before she finally kills him with a kick to the throat. The Chinese bodyguard renders Luk all but unconscious and is about to kill him, but Madam Leung intervenes, and a fight begins between her and the bodyguard. She is more than a match for him, and she soon knocks him out. Donnie chases Michael throughout the building, beating him whenever he catches him, until Michael finds a decorative sword and uses it to attack Donnie. Donnie narrowly avoids the blade until Madam Yeung appears with another sword and begins an armed duel with Michael. Donnie climbs to the rooftop to save Luk's mother, but finds her guarded by Woods. They have by far the longest and most spectacular fight in the film as Woods pushes Donnie to his uttermost limits, almost killing him multiple times and finally throwing him to the edge of the roof. Finally Donnie manages to knock Woods off the roof and to his death with a flying kick. Luk rescues his mother. Michael defeats Madam Leung in their sword duel, cutting her and knocking her to the floor, stunned. He's about to kill her, but Luk saves her and manages to disarm Michael. Michael viciously beats Luk, but Luk's mother reloads the gun and saves him with it. Michael disarms her, but Madam Leung recovers and attacks the now unarmed Michael, gaining the advantage. Michael retrieves the tape bomb and its trigger and takes Luk hostage as Madam Leung retrieves the gun. They reach a standoff, but then Madam Leung shoots Michael through the hand, and she and Luk kick him through a glass railing and off a high ledge to his death. In an epilogue, viewers learn that Mr. Robinson was found guilty of drug trafficking and sent to prison."

Seattle police officers Madam Yeung Lai-ching , Donnie Yen, and their Caucasian partner Peter Woods tail a group of Chinese cocaine dealers through a mall. Madam Yeung and Peter tail them to a seaport that night, where a shipment has just arrived from Hong Kong. Chinese workmen load crates into the drug dealers' truck. Madam Yeung, in defiance of Peter, acrobatically infiltrates the docks and enters the truck, but is caught by one of the workmen, Luk Wan-ting . She convinces him that she's a stowaway illegal immigrant from Hong Kong, and he takes her to his nearby attic apartment, where he gives her some money to help her, as he and his brother too were illegal immigrants for seven years. He has just obtained legal ID cards for both of them. She tries to stealthily check in with Peter, who is tailing the cocaine dealers to an unknown location, but Luk grows suspicious and catches her. Just then Luk's brother Ming  crashes in through a skylight, pursued by six armed thugs to whom he owes $20,000 due to his gambling addiction. Luk attacks the thugs to save Ming, revealing that he has some martial arts skill. Madam Yeung joins the fight against the thugs. Together they drive the thugs away. She returns Luk's money and leaves. The next morning, Madam Yeung realizes that one of the Chinese cocaine dealers is following her. She ambushes him, and they fight. He has some martial arts skill, but not as much as her. After a minute he gives up and flees by jumping off a hundred-foot tower into the harbor. Meanwhile, Donnie tails one of the cocaine dealers to a restaurant, where his friend Captain Michael Wong happens to be having breakfast with a girl. He comes over to say hi to Donnie, inadvertently obscuring Donnie's view as the cocaine dealer leaves. Both of them run outside in search of the criminal, but are ambushed by a couple martial artists. Donnie easily beats up both thugs and arrests them. Elsewhere, Peter has tailed the cocaine dealers to a mining corporation warehouse on the docks, where they sell cocaine to a Caucasian gang. Peter attempts to arrest them all, revealing that the Caucasians' leader is a CIA officer named Mr. Robinson, which the Hong Kong dealers didn't know. He photographs Mr. Robinson in the act of the cocaine deal. Mr. Robinson draws a concealed shotgun and shoots Peter in the torso, and then he and his men shoot all the Chinese dealers dead . They try to retrieve the camera, but Peter is still alive, and he flees the warehouse even as Mr. Robinson shoots him again. Outside, he crashes into Luk, hands him his gun and the negative of the photo, and tells him to give it to the police. Then Mr. Robinson and his men catch up and shoot him dead. They open fire at Luk too, but Luk flees behind a shed and accidentally drops the negative into the ocean. Mr. Robinson and his men continue to pursue Luk and shoot at him, but Luk is rescued at the last moment by the arrival of the Seattle police. Mr. Robinson and his men jump into their car and escape. Madam Yeung, Donnie, and the other officers drive up and find their partner's corpse and Luk with a gun. They arrest Luk. At the Seattle police station, Donnie interrogates Luk, thinking he was a member of the Hong Kong gang and convinced that he hid the negative somewhere, while Luk proclaims his innocence. Donnie's interrogation is interrupted by a higher ranking officer, and Donnie leaves the interrogation room. The new officer threatens Luk to give him the negative, and brutally beats him with a baton when he claims he doesn't know where it is. Luk defends himself and knocks out the corrupt officer, then puts on his uniform and sneaks out of the police station. Luk goes to Ming's apartment, and Ming gives up his ID card, which Luk worked for seven years to get him, to get $3000 for a seat on a ship to take Luk back to Hong Kong that night. It is revealed that Luk is skilled at repairing Ming's TV antenna. Just then a couple of gunmen enter the apartment in search of Luk. Ming sacrifices his life to save Luk, while Luk keeps trying to save Ming until he dies, then finally flees. Just as Luk reaches the apartment complex's exit, Madam Yeung and Donnie pull up outside, having come to arrest him. Luk runs back in. Madam Yeung and Donnie split up to search the apartment complex. Donnie sees Luk and chases him onto the rooftop, where Luk ambushes him, and they fight. Donnie almost immediately gets the advantage and beats up Luk, who flees, jumping from rooftops with Donnie in hot pursuit. Luk jumps onto a Budget truck and rides it away. Donnie, still convinced that Luk is a cocaine dealer, draws his gun and takes aim, but Madam Yeung appears and knocks it away to save the potentially innocent Luk, who escapes. Back at the Seattle police station, Donnie's superior orders him off the case because he has no faith in him, and replaces him with Michael. Donnie requests to stay on the case as Michael's partner, and Michael convinces their superior to allow it. That night, Luk goes to board the ship to Hong Kong. He has to sell his ID card as well to buy passage. Donnie gets information that Luk escaped to Hong Kong on that ship, and he, Michael, and Madam Yeung fly to Hong Kong, arriving before the ship. When the ship reaches port, the Hong Kong police board it to arrest Luk. Luk flees to the other side of the ship and jumps off onto a cargo dock, then lies atop a giant cargo container as a forklift carries it through the police barrier. Donnie climbs atop a tall stack of cargo containers and sees Luk escape. Luk goes to a phone booth and calls his mother, who lives in Hong Kong, to tell her that he's returned and will see her soon. Donnie catches up with him and chases him to a beach, where they fight. Madam Yeung arrives and yells at Donnie to stop beating Luk, finally pointing her gun at him. Donnie knocks her gun into the ocean, and she attacks him. Their fight is broken up by Michael and the Hong Kong police, and Luk is arrested again. Michael, Madam Yeung, and a Hong Kong police officer ride with Luk toward the Hong Kong police station in the back of an ambulance. Madam Yeung interrogates Luk, who tells her that a Seattle police officer attacked him in the station. Michael tries to convince Luk to let him extradite him back to the U.S. Just then a large blue truck pulls up alongside them, and two thugs, one of them played by John Salvitti, jump from it onto the roof of the ambulance. Salvitti swings around and kicks through the driver's window, knocking out the driver and taking his place. The other thug throws a gas bomb through the window into the back. The gas knocks out Michael, Luk, and the Hong Kong police officer, but Madam Yeung grabs the ambulance's inhaler and uses it to avoid the gas until the thug breaks in through the rear doors. She kicks him out, and he climbs back onto the roof. She climbs up after him, and they fight on the roof of the speeding ambulance. He kicks her off, but she does a 720 degree backflip, kicks through the side windows, and hangs upside down by her feet, her head almost striking the road. She struggles to get back up, but he kicks her down again, and she clings to the ambulance, her dragging feet almost getting sucked under the rear wheels. He climbs down and kicks her repeatedly, but she manages to pull herself up and kick him away, then climb over to the broken driver's window and attack Salvitti. Salvitti draws a gun and opens fire at her, and she ends up falling off the front of the ambulance and clinging to the grill, her feet dragging on the road underneath the ambulance. Salvitti speeds forward and attempts to crush her between the ambulance and the rear of the blue truck, but she manages to climb free enough to throw herself out of the way and roll out on the road behind the vehicles as they escape with Luk and Michael as captives. Madam Yeung organizes a Hong Kong police search team for them. Meanwhile, Luk and Michael are tortured by being tied up in a freezer. A thug played by Paul Wong interrogates, beats, and further tortures them, seeking the negative. Michael manages to free himself from his bonds and knock out the thug, then free Luk. Michael tries to convince Luk to give him the negative, and Luk begins to tell him about it, but they're interrupted by the arrival of a thug played by Michael Woods. Luk and Michael get separated, and Luk hides in a parked car. Michael meets up with three thugs - John Salvitti, Michael Woods, and Stephan Berwick. It is revealed that he is their boss. Meanwhile, Luk uses his electronics skills to get the car's radio working, and he contacts the Hong Kong police headquarters, who locate the signal's source and come to rescue him. Then Michael finds Luk and asks for the negative again. Luk tells him that he lost the negative, and he doesn't know where, but he saw the murderer of the American cop and could recognize him. Michael surreptitiously reaches for his gun, but just then Madam Yeung and the Hong Kong police arrive. They take Luk back into custody, and Michael declares that he's going to extradite him back to the U.S. Madam Yeung drives Luk toward the airport to be flown back to the U.S. On the way, Luk requests to see his mother before leaving. Madam Yeung is reluctantly convinced, and she drives Luk to his mother's home, where they have an emotional conversation as Luk and his mother are overjoyed to see each other, but Luk's mother is devastated by learning that he is suspected of a crime severe enough to involve U.S. police. They also meet up with Donnie. Madam Yeung, Luk, and Donnie walk outside and are attacked by Salvitti, who rides up on a motorcycle and opens fire with an automatic rifle, shooting Luk in the heart. Madam Leung and Donnie carry Luk and flee. Donnie lures Salvitti away while Madam Leung gets Luk to the nearest hospital. Donnie ambushes Salvitti and fights him. Salvitti is almost a match for him, but Donnie manages to beat him up and arrest him. The next morning, at the hospital, Luk is unconscious but past the most dangerous period and will likely recover. Madam Yeung and Donnie argue, with Donnie accusing Madam Yeung of too much sentimentality, particularly for having let Luk see his mother and thereby exposing him to danger, and Madam Yeung accusing Donnie of too much impulsiveness and egotistical attitude. Then Madam Yeung's superior enters the room and berates her for granting Luk's request, but Donnie defends her by claiming responsibility for the decision. Afterward she tries to thank him, but he avoids her. Michael meets with the Chinese cocaine dealer and tells him that his cocaine and Michael's money were both lost to the police, but he promises revenge. The dealer drives off, accompanied by a tough-looking Caucasian woman . Later, at the Hong Kong police headquarters, Donnie interrogates Salvitti while Madam Yeung and Michael watch. Donnie reveals that Salvitti has a distinctive tattoo on his forearm, which he explains is a sign of the Field Troop of the U.S. Navy – the symbol of Black Fox, Troop 3. According to the Pentagon's records, on October 26, 1979, was entirely destroyed in the civil war of Nicaragua, but a suspect killed in this case in the U.S. the previous month also had this tattoo. Salvitti taunts Donnie, who brutally beats him. Salvitti surreptitiously injects himself with a concealed needle and dies, making it look like he died from Donnie's beating. Later that day, Michael takes Donnie to the airport, telling him the Hong Kong police complained that Donnie's violence caused Salvitti's death, so Michael has to transfer him back to Seattle. Donnie tricks Michael into thinking he's left, but then doubles back, suspicious. That night, Michael takes Madam Yeung to dinner at a nice restaurant, and the Chinese cocaine dealer plants a bomb under her car. Madam Yeung narrowly avoids the explosion and attacks the dealer, but his female bodyguard drives up and rescues him, and they escape. Later that night, Stephan Berwick rappels down the outside of the hospital and shoots what he thinks is Luk with an automatic rifle through the window, but it's a decoy dummy, and the doctors in the room reveal themselves to be disguised Hong Kong policemen, and they draw their guns and return fire. Berwick flees. Madam Yeung sends the officers after him, then goes to the room where Luk actually is and checks up on him. He's still unconscious. The room is attacked by Paul Wong, who takes Madam Yeung by surprise and stabs her in the neck with a tranquilizer syringe, then draws a large knife and attacks her as she struggles to stay awake. The doctor tries to interfere, but Paul stabs him to death, cuts Madam Yeung, and knocks her out of the way. He tries to kill the unconscious Luk, but Madam Yeung saves him for a few more seconds. Finally he knocks her back again and she's too close to unconsciousness to move, but at the last moment Donnie bursts into the room and attacks Paul. They fight briefly before Donnie kills him. The next morning, Madam Yeung is recuperating in a church along with Donnie and the still-unconscious Luk. She asks him why he didn't return to the U.S., and he explains that he felt something was wrong about the death of Salvitti. She knows that he suspects Michael is one of the criminals, but he doesn't want to admit it, as they're good friends. They argue, but then come to an understanding. Just then Luk wakes and explains all that happened from his perspective. Later that day, Madam Yeung's superior orders her to let Michael take Luk back to the U.S. Madam Yeung secretly organizes a Hong Kong police raid of the Chinese drug dealers' lab, but tells Michael, who comes with her, that they're just going to get Luk. They enter the lab, and a huge gunfight breaks out. Madam Yeung pursues the ringleader into a metal stairwell and kills him. His female bodyguard attacks her, and they have a long and brutal fight. Finally the female bodyguard falls down an elevator shaft to her death, despite Madam Yeung's last-minute attempt to save her. As a consequence of Madam Yeung's insubordinate actions, the Hong Kong police chief is forced to declare her under arrest. However, she hasn't returned with Michael. Meanwhile, back at the church, Luk identifies Mr. Robinson to Donnie, who recognizes him as a CIA officer. Madam Yeung goes to Luk's mother's house. There she is ambushed by Michael Woods and Stephan Berwick, who beat her up and capture her, having already abducted Luk's mother. She's rescued by the arrival of a Hong Kong police squad, who chase Michael and Stephan away. One officer stays behind to arrest Madam Yeung, but she knocks him out and flees. Donnie confronts Michael about his suspicions. Michael reveals that he is a CIA officer, and that his division, which includes Mr. Robinson, sells drugs to raise money in order to support a Latin American anti-government force, which is in the U.S.'s political interests. He invites Donnie to join them. Donnie refuses, and Michael reveals a deadly syringe concealed in his shoe and unleashes a flurry of quick, vicious kicks at Donnie, who avoids them all and starts to gain the advantage until Michael draws a gun. Donnie flees on foot into the streets, but the hidden tape on which he recorded Michael's confession is destroyed. Michael sees that there was a tape, but doesn't realize it's broken. Michael sends Woods and Berwick after Donnie on motorcycles. Donnie narrowly avoids them for a brief, stunt-filled chase, and then he jumps up and kicks Berwick off his motorcycle and steals it. A long motorcycle chase and fight ensues between him and Woods throughout the streets, hills, and obstacle-filled back alleys of Hong Kong. Finally Donnie gains the advantage, but Woods escapes. Donnie meets up with Madam Yeung, but Michael has framed Donnie for a crime, and now both of them are pursued by the police in a desperate foot chase through a parking garage.

He appears to be suffering from amnesia and is unable to pass on the vital information he learned from the mission. The surgeon diagnoses no actual injury to the brain, but states that the memory loss is most likely attributable to shock, and in such cases memory is most often recovered through some mental jolt from the past. Moira Barrett  is summoned to his bedside; he seems to recognise her, and his mind starts to go into flashback mode. Paul is seen as part of a flying circus display at which Moira is a spectator. A serious accident to one of the planes brings them together. That evening he meets old flame Eve Heatherley , who is now engaged Paul's friend Jack Graves . He runs into Moira again, and they talk of her passion for flying. The display accident causes the flying circus to fold and Paul is out of a job. He drifts from job to job for a time, before running into Chuck Rockley , a fellow performer in the old flying circus, who informs him that he and Jack are starting a new flying circus to be financed by Eve, now married to Jack. Paul accepts the offer to join them, and together they open the Pegasus Flying Field. The venture is a success, but Eve soon loses interest and starts to take an interest in Jerry Frazer, a local ex-pilot. One afternoon an aircraft makes an emergency landing at Pegasus, and it turns out that the pilot is Moira, who is training for a record-breaking long-distance flight. She says she is looking for a co-pilot and asks Jack, who is talked out of it by Eve, and Paul, who refuses on the grounds of the plan being too risky. He does however agree to give Moira instruction in blind flying. The Pegasus pilots are offered the opportunity to earn extra money by flying at night to give the local RAF station the opportunity to practice searchlight operations. Moira accompanies Paul on one flight, but the plane develops engine trouble and they have to land away from base. They check in to a local hotel for the night and realise that they are in love. Meanwhile Jerry, encouraged by Eve, is working on an idea he has for freight-carrying gliders. When Eve dies suddenly and unexpectedly, Jack steps in to help Jerry with his ideas. Initially there is little commercial interest in the glider idea, until finally an aviation company offers to build a prototype if Pegasus will agree to finance a Transatlantic test flight. Moira agrees to front up the cash as long as she is allowed to join the flight. The glider is built and preparations are finalised for its inaugural flight when an inspection by the Air Ministry calls a halt, as the prototype is too close in design to a craft secretly being worked on by their own designers. In recompense, the Air Ministry offers to buy out the Pegasus concern and provide the Pegasus men with RAF piloting jobs. Everyone is happy apart from Moira, who is bitterly disappointed about losing the chance of a Transatlantic flight. Paul asks her to marry him. The action returns to the present, where Paul's memory is obviously returning. He starts to question Moira but she tells him that he is over-tired and they will discuss things the following day. She leaves his bedside and goes into an ante-room, where she is met by two small children asking ""Can we see Daddy now?"""

Assuming the man is the victim of a hit-and-run, he stops to offer assistance, only to be coshed and left stunned while his wallet and car are stolen. On recovering his senses, he staggers towards a nearby farmhouse where he collapses. He is found by the farm owner, who summons a doctor. Meanwhile the car thief comes to grief while speeding round a corner on a clifftop road, the car plunges over the edge and explodes in flames. Sherwin regains consciousness, but is suffering from complete amnesia with no idea of his own identity or how he came to be found in such a remote location. The farm owner and his daughter agree to look after Sherwin while he recuperates. The police investigate missing persons reports but find no case to match Sherwin's age and physical description. Some days later Sherwin is on the mend, and happens to find in his overcoat pocket a ticket stub from a theatre in a town some 50 miles away. Hoping to find some clue as to his identity, he takes a train to the town and walks the streets to see whether anything will jog his memory. He comes across a house which he seems to recognise and walks in through the unlocked door. Inside he finds a flower-covered coffin in the front room. A woman  enters and on seeing Sherwin, screams and faints. This jolts Sherwin's memory back into gear and he recognises the woman as his wife Christine, who has believed him dead since there was no reason for anybody to consider that the body found in the burned-out car was not his. Sherwin is bothered by his wife's odd demeanour, particularly her excessive concern about whether or not anybody could have seen him in the street or arriving at the house. His suspicions aroused, he decides to continue to play the amnesiac. Saying he is going upstairs to rest, he eavesdrops on her telephone calls and soon realises that she is speaking to a lover of some time standing, the gist of the conversation being the need to dispose of Sherwin quickly before anyone else finds out that he was not the crash victim. Gradually, he finds out that Christine and her lover  had been intending to sell the house and cash all his assets, and his inconvenient reappearance has derailed their plans. Aware now of Christine's true colours, he decides to play along with her schemes until he can engineer a suitable come-uppance for the pair.

Liz thinks that joining a sorority is more important than her education, and is surprised that her fellow roommate Adelaide Swanson  is not interested in Tri-U. During her first weeks in college, Liz has no trouble befriending Tri-U's members, including Dallas Prewitt , Marge Colby , Merry Coombs  and Casey Krausse . Janet, on the other hand, does not make an impression on the snobbish girls. Neither does shy Ruth Gates , whose mother was a respected Tri-U, but she is - unlike Janet - admitted to the pledge due to her family name. Liz is pledged as well, and feels guilty for seeing her dream come true, while Janet, crushed by the rejection, is leaving the college. Meanwhile, she meets Joe Blake , a senior at college and once a member of the army who is opposed to sororities due to its snobbish cliques. Liz is also pushed by arrogant Dallas to date Chad Carnes , the most popular fraternity boy whose reputation as a drunken womanizer is not unnoticed by Liz. She initially does not take a liking in him, but Chad wins over her affection and convinces her to help him cheat at an important exam. Her sorority sisters acclaim her as a hero for her actions, but Joe feels disappointed in her lack of ethics. Soon after, 'Hell Week' begins, which includes humiliating and taking pranks on the new pledges. On insistence of Dallas, Ruth is released from the pledge, while Liz is assigned to make silly errands. She runs into Joe, and agrees to accompany him to a party. Chad also attends this party, and chastises Liz for ignoring her duties. Joe sticks up for her, and gets into a fist fight with Chad. Realizing that Joe is the one she wants to be with, she rejects Chad and returns to Tri-U. There, she is disgusted to find out that Ruth has been de-pledged. She goes out to look for her, and finds her wondering on the streets. Liz takes Ruth to the hospital, where she is diagnosed with pneumonia. Ashamed for being part of a clique that has done this to Ruth, Liz heads back to Tri-U to return her pin. The girls feel that she is out of her mind for doing this, but Liz castigates them for their hypocrisy and snobbishness. She leaves with Joe, wondering how her mother will react.

Along with her best friend Janet Shaw , she leaves her parental home to join the same college - Midwestern University - where her mother was once a legendary alma mater. Liz and Janet dream of being pledged by the elite group of girls who call themselves Tri-U Sorority. Liz thinks that joining a sorority is more important than her education, and is surprised that her fellow roommate Adelaide Swanson  is not interested in Tri-U.

Janet, on the other hand, does not make an impression on the snobbish girls. Neither does shy Ruth Gates , whose mother was a respected Tri-U, but she is - unlike Janet - admitted to the pledge due to her family name. Liz is pledged as well, and feels guilty for seeing her dream come true, while Janet, crushed by the rejection, is leaving the college. Meanwhile, she meets Joe Blake , a senior at college and once a member of the army who is opposed to sororities due to its snobbish cliques. Liz is also pushed by arrogant Dallas to date Chad Carnes , the most popular fraternity boy whose reputation as a drunken womanizer is not unnoticed by Liz. She initially does not take a liking in him, but Chad wins over her affection and convinces her to help him cheat at an important exam. Her sorority sisters acclaim her as a hero for her actions, but Joe feels disappointed in her lack of ethics. Soon after, 'Hell Week' begins, which includes humiliating and taking pranks on the new pledges. On insistence of Dallas, Ruth is released from the pledge, while Liz is assigned to make silly errands. She runs into Joe, and agrees to accompany him to a party. Chad also attends this party, and chastises Liz for ignoring her duties. Joe sticks up for her, and gets into a fist fight with Chad. Realizing that Joe is the one she wants to be with, she rejects Chad and returns to Tri-U. There, she is disgusted to find out that Ruth has been de-pledged. She goes out to look for her, and finds her wondering on the streets. Liz takes Ruth to the hospital, where she is diagnosed with pneumonia. Ashamed for being part of a clique that has done this to Ruth, Liz heads back to Tri-U to return her pin. The girls feel that she is out of her mind for doing this, but Liz castigates them for their hypocrisy and snobbishness. She leaves with Joe, wondering how her mother will react.

Liz thinks that joining a sorority is more important than her education, and is surprised that her fellow roommate Adelaide Swanson  is not interested in Tri-U. During her first weeks in college, Liz has no trouble befriending Tri-U's members, including Dallas Prewitt , Marge Colby , Merry Coombs  and Casey Krausse . Janet, on the other hand, does not make an impression on the snobbish girls. Neither does shy Ruth Gates , whose mother was a respected Tri-U, but she is - unlike Janet - admitted to the pledge due to her family name. Liz is pledged as well, and feels guilty for seeing her dream come true, while Janet, crushed by the rejection, is leaving the college. Meanwhile, she meets Joe Blake , a senior at college and once a member of the army who is opposed to sororities due to its snobbish cliques. Liz is also pushed by arrogant Dallas to date Chad Carnes , the most popular fraternity boy whose reputation as a drunken womanizer is not unnoticed by Liz. She initially does not take a liking in him, but Chad wins over her affection and convinces her to help him cheat at an important exam. Her sorority sisters acclaim her as a hero for her actions, but Joe feels disappointed in her lack of ethics. Soon after, 'Hell Week' begins, which includes humiliating and taking pranks on the new pledges. On insistence of Dallas, Ruth is released from the pledge, while Liz is assigned to make silly errands. She runs into Joe, and agrees to accompany him to a party. Chad also attends this party, and chastises Liz for ignoring her duties. Joe sticks up for her, and gets into a fist fight with Chad. Realizing that Joe is the one she wants to be with, she rejects Chad and returns to Tri-U. There, she is disgusted to find out that Ruth has been de-pledged. She goes out to look for her, and finds her wondering on the streets. Liz takes Ruth to the hospital, where she is diagnosed with pneumonia. Ashamed for being part of a clique that has done this to Ruth, Liz heads back to Tri-U to return her pin. The girls feel that she is out of her mind for doing this, but Liz castigates them for their hypocrisy and snobbishness. She leaves with Joe, wondering how her mother will react.

Liz and Janet dream of being pledged by the elite group of girls who call themselves Tri-U Sorority. Liz thinks that joining a sorority is more important than her education, and is surprised that her fellow roommate Adelaide Swanson  is not interested in Tri-U. During her first weeks in college, Liz has no trouble befriending Tri-U's members, including Dallas Prewitt , Marge Colby , Merry Coombs  and Casey Krausse . Janet, on the other hand, does not make an impression on the snobbish girls. Neither does shy Ruth Gates , whose mother was a respected Tri-U, but she is - unlike Janet - admitted to the pledge due to her family name. Liz is pledged as well, and feels guilty for seeing her dream come true, while Janet, crushed by the rejection, is leaving the college. Meanwhile, she meets Joe Blake , a senior at college and once a member of the army who is opposed to sororities due to its snobbish cliques. Liz is also pushed by arrogant Dallas to date Chad Carnes , the most popular fraternity boy whose reputation as a drunken womanizer is not unnoticed by Liz. She initially does not take a liking in him, but Chad wins over her affection and convinces her to help him cheat at an important exam. Her sorority sisters acclaim her as a hero for her actions, but Joe feels disappointed in her lack of ethics. Soon after, 'Hell Week' begins, which includes humiliating and taking pranks on the new pledges. On insistence of Dallas, Ruth is released from the pledge, while Liz is assigned to make silly errands. She runs into Joe, and agrees to accompany him to a party.

Realizing that Joe is the one she wants to be with, she rejects Chad and returns to Tri-U. There, she is disgusted to find out that Ruth has been de-pledged. She goes out to look for her, and finds her wondering on the streets. Liz takes Ruth to the hospital, where she is diagnosed with pneumonia. Ashamed for being part of a clique that has done this to Ruth, Liz heads back to Tri-U to return her pin.

The dinner is intended to announce Arthur as the new chairman of her corporation, Bach Worldwide. Driving to the dinner in a Batmobile, an intoxicated Arthur is chased by police, arrested and released the next day. Vivienne and her shrewd assistant Susan  form a plan to have Susan marry Arthur to allow her to take control of the company, ensuring stable leadership. Arthur initially refuses, but is told that he will be cut off from his $950 million inheritance if he does not marry Susan. He reluctantly agrees and asks Susan's father, Burt Johnson , for permission to marry. Burt agrees, after forcing Arthur against a table saw and warning him not to embarrass Susan. The next day, Arthur meets Naomi , an illegal tour guide to whom he becomes attracted because of her free-spirited nature. He arranges his wedding while sneaking around on dates with Naomi. Arthur's nanny, Lillian Hobson  – who normally dislikes all of Arthur's choices in women – gets to know and like Naomi. Arthur learns that Naomi would like to have her children's book about the Statue of Liberty published. He attempts to find employment and other options so that he will be able to keep seeing Naomi and not need the inheritance, but to no avail. Hobson takes Arthur to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, where Arthur complains that it is depressing and makes him want to drink. He proclaims he is going to drink, unintentionally brags about his wealth, and turns to leave the meeting. Hobson stands up and takes the bullet, giving Arthur’s humiliating introduction in his place. Arthur, touched, states that if only she would do his drinking for him as well, he would be set. Arthur goes to see Naomi at her house and tells her the truth – that he is engaged to Susan. Naomi then tells him to leave. Back home, Arthur calls for Hobson, only for Bitterman to come and tell him that she is in bed with a headache. Later, Hobson goes to Naomi and asks her to give Arthur another chance, but she again falls ill and is taken to a hospital. Naomi calls Arthur to tell him what has happened. He comes to the hospital, meets Naomi and is about to make up with her, but Susan arrives and tells Naomi that Arthur has bought the company that is handling the publication of her book. Upset, Naomi leaves the hospital. Hobson comes home and Arthur takes care of her. The two begin to get along better. However, a few days later, Hobson dies in her sleep and Arthur reverts to alcoholism to numb the pain of her death, the loss of Naomi and being married to Susan. At his wedding, Arthur gets drunk and finds Hobson's last letter to him in which she advises him to follow his heart. Arthur decides, during the vows, not to proceed with the marriage. Susan and her father become belligerent and begin punching him, which makes Vivienne realize that Susan is only after her company. Nevertheless, Vivienne still wants Susan to be Arthur's wife, so she again threatens him with disinheritance if he pursues Naomi. Arthur strips nearly naked to emphasise that he wants no kind of dependency on his mother's money and runs to Naomi's apartment. He tells her that he just lost his mum  but Naomi, still upset with him, says she can't replace Hobson and refuses any prospect of their getting back together. Six months later, Arthur is now sober. He has got back his inheritance because he is managing the company's charity. He goes to a bookshop to buy Naomi's book – which she has dedicated to him – and sees an advertisement for a book-reading she will be giving at a library. Arthur goes to the library and, this time, Naomi takes him back. The two leave the library and Bitterman drives them through the city in the Batmobile with the police following in pursuit.

Lieutenant Kuroki  keeps his men firmly in hand and building a boat for their escape. An American plane crashes on the same island with a platoon of U.S. soldiers led by Captain Dennis Bourke , Sergeant Bleeker  and 2nd Lieutenant Blair . Confidant to Bourke is the chief pharmacist mate . As both sides learn of each other's existence on the island, tension mounts resulting in a battle for the Japanese boat. The vessel is destroyed and a Japanese soldier is seriously injured. Calling a truce, Koruki trades the Americans access to water in exchange for a visit from their doctor to treat the wounded soldier, whose leg has to be amputated. The truce results in both platoons living side by side, although a line is drawn forbidding one from encroaching on the other's side of the island. At first, there is some clandestine cooperation and trading and earnest respect and friendship. When the Americans establish radio contact and their pick-up by a US naval vessel is arranged they demand that the Japanese surrender. As the Americans proceed to the beach, the American captain orders his men to shoot to kill. They are ambushed by the coerced Japanese platoon, who presumably were also unwillingly acting on orders to shoot to kill. The Americans were given no option, but to retaliate in self-defense that results in an ensuing bloody and pointless firefight during which all the Japanese  and most of the Americans are shot dead. The medic, Bourke, Bleeker, Blair and Craddock are the only survivors of the skirmish. They move onto the beach and wait to be rescued up by the American naval vessel, stationed just offshore. Kuroki's final narration calls what he is to do ""just another day."" The film ends with a long shot of the island, superimposed with the words ""Nobody ever wins""."

Towler initially feels the role should be taken by the combat experienced former Sergeant now Private Kincaid  who has eleven years of service as a Marine. However, Ladd lost his former rank through misconduct and doing things his own way. Ladd's prowess as a hero is demonstrated in the opening battle scene where he picks up a M1919 Browning machine gun and fires it from the hip into charging North Korean hordes. Before he dies, the Lieutenant reminds Towler that he is next in line for command, not Kincaid. One of the platoon, Pvt Bracken ([[Paul Richards , openly questions Towler's authority in favour of Kincaid.

Jeffries is out looking for the Abominable Snowman who lives in a cave in one of the mountains. He is convinced that the Snowman lives close by, but Pemba tells him he will not lead Jeffries anymore, as it would be intruding on the territory of the snowman. Jeffries, who seems to care about the snowman over the safety of Pemba, decides to cut the rope and continue. As soon as Jeffries fades from view, Pemba sees the out line of a large creature in front of him. Meanwhile, Fred, Velma, and Daphne are on vacation in Paris. However, Scooby-Doo and Shaggy have not arrived yet, and the gang wonders where they are. Shaggy and Scooby are in a small plane that they think is going to Paris, but is really going to the Himalayas to drop off Alphonse LaFleur, a world famous French hunter and trapper. LaFleur wants to find and kill the snowman, and is taking Shaggy and Scooby along as bait. The pilot questions whether the monster is real, but Lafleur tells him it is. LaFleur then locks Shaggy and Scooby up with his equipment, and throws them off the plane. Shaggy, realizing they are not going to Paris, manages to get a quick phone call through to Fred before the phone goes dead. Fred uses the GPS on his phone to track them, and then he, Velma, and Daphne head to the Himalayas to find them. Velma wonders if it has anything to do with the legend of the creature in the Himalayas. Meanwhile, Shaggy and Scooby manage to land near a small village on the mountain. In the village are Jeffries and Pemba. Jeffries tells Pemba he never should have left him, and that he almost died on the mountain. Many of the other villagers are leaving, fearing the creature and its wrath. Shaggy and Scooby go to the High Lama to ask for a phone to call their friends. The High Lama, a strange person, tells them there is only a phone on the weather station nearby. Scooby finds a room where the villagers worship the Snowman. The High Lama is uneasy about letting them go in, but lets them. In it is a statue of the Snowman holding a very large crystal, and Jeffries asks if he could see it, but the High Lama says no and closes the door. They then meet Pemba's sister Minga, who has decided to stay in the village. Minga is constantly listening to the radio, and has a crush on the DJ of the station she is listening to. Pemba tells her to leave the village, and he, Shaggy, Scooby, and Jeffries , decide to go to the weather station. LaFleur arrives, and decides to accompany them. As they travel, Minga runs up to them and says that she heard on the radio that a big storm is approaching. Shaggy wonders how there could be any reception so high up, and Pemba tells him there isn't, its just the weather station man pretending to be a DJ. Pemba is annoyed that Minga did not leave the village, and thinks she just wants to see the weather station man, but she tells him there really is a storm. Everyone looks up and sees a dark cloud, and they decide to set up camp to wait out the storm. During the night, Jeffries gets out of his tent and leaves with his sled, which is filled with TNT and other explosives. Some time later, the Snowman attacks Shaggy and Scooby, who were standing watch. LaFleur tries to capture the Snowman, but all his traps backfire and work on him. Scooby and Shaggy manage to lose the Snowman but get lost themselves. However, they are relieved to see a snowplow approach them. In it is Del Chillman, whom the gang had meet before. Del takes them to the weather station, where he works. Chillman tells them he decided to take the job so he could find out if the legend of the creature is true. He also reveals that he is the DJ. He had the radio just to do weather reports, but plays songs to pass the time. Meanwhile, Fred, Velma, and Daphne get to the village and see it is deserted. They follow Shaggy‚Äôs tracks and see where the party camped the night before, and also the foot prints of the Snowman. Velma notes that they are not very deep in the snow. They find Pemba, who was caught by one of LaFleur's traps. Minga is nowhere to be found and Jeffries is still gone, so the gang decides to split up and search for everyone else. At the weather station, Chillman goes out to look for the others. Once he leaves the Snowman appears and attacks Shaggy and Scooby. As they run away, LaFleur shows up and tries to capture the creature, but falls of a cliff, apparently to his death. Scooby and Shaggy manage to escape and find their way to the lost kingdom of Shangri-La, and meet the High Lama. Del catches up to the rest of the gang, but finds the weather station destroyed and some Helium cases missing. As Scooby and Shaggy walk around the city, the Snowman appears and gives chase. Daphne and Pemba find a large cave and go inside, and conclude that is where the monster lives. They also find an empty helium case. Shaggy and Scooby loose the monster again, and everyone meets up in an old mine, each coming from a different direction. There they see Jeffries mining for lots of crystals like the one on the yeti statue. They conclude he is the snowman and capture him, although he says he is not. Then the snowman appears and chases everyone, while Jeffries gets free and follows them. The monster chases Shaggy, Scooby, and Jeffries down the mountain. Jeffries is trying to get the crystals that are in the mine cart That Scooby and Shaggy are riding in. The rest of the gang prepares a trap for the Snowman, but Shaggy, Scooby, and Jeffries get caught in it. The High Lama comes out to see what happened. Then an avalanche starts, and almost crushes Velma and Del, but the Snowman saves them at the last moment. The creature is unmasked to be Minga, who has been behind the mystery from the very beginning. She used the helium to fly, which caused the footprints to not be as deep. She did it so the weather station man would not stop broadcasting his radio show. Del is touched by Minga's actions. Jeffries is taken to jail because he was taking the crystals for his own gain. The gang wonders if there really is a Snowman, but then LaFleur appears and tells them that something saved him from his fall and brought him to the village. The gang, along with Del and Minga, return to Paris for their vacation. Unfortunately, Fred gets on the wrong plane and ends up in the Amazon as the others head there.

Jeffries is out looking for the Abominable Snowman who lives in a cave in one of the mountains. He is convinced that the Snowman lives close by, but Pemba tells him he will not lead Jeffries anymore, as it would be intruding on the territory of the snowman. Jeffries, who seems to care about the snowman over the safety of Pemba, decides to cut the rope and continue. As soon as Jeffries fades from view, Pemba sees the out line of a large creature in front of him. Meanwhile, Fred, Velma, and Daphne are on vacation in Paris. However, Scooby-Doo and Shaggy have not arrived yet, and the gang wonders where they are. Shaggy and Scooby are in a small plane that they think is going to Paris, but is really going to the Himalayas to drop off Alphonse LaFleur, a world famous French hunter and trapper. LaFleur wants to find and kill the snowman, and is taking Shaggy and Scooby along as bait. The pilot questions whether the monster is real, but Lafleur tells him it is. LaFleur then locks Shaggy and Scooby up with his equipment, and throws them off the plane. Shaggy, realizing they are not going to Paris, manages to get a quick phone call through to Fred before the phone goes dead. Fred uses the GPS on his phone to track them, and then he, Velma, and Daphne head to the Himalayas to find them. Velma wonders if it has anything to do with the legend of the creature in the Himalayas. Meanwhile, Shaggy and Scooby manage to land near a small village on the mountain. In the village are Jeffries and Pemba. Jeffries tells Pemba he never should have left him, and that he almost died on the mountain. Many of the other villagers are leaving, fearing the creature and its wrath. Shaggy and Scooby go to the High Lama to ask for a phone to call their friends. The High Lama, a strange person, tells them there is only a phone on the weather station nearby. Scooby finds a room where the villagers worship the Snowman. The High Lama is uneasy about letting them go in, but lets them. In it is a statue of the Snowman holding a very large crystal, and Jeffries asks if he could see it, but the High Lama says no and closes the door. They then meet Pemba's sister Minga, who has decided to stay in the village. Minga is constantly listening to the radio, and has a crush on the DJ of the station she is listening to. Pemba tells her to leave the village, and he, Shaggy, Scooby, and Jeffries , decide to go to the weather station. LaFleur arrives, and decides to accompany them. As they travel, Minga runs up to them and says that she heard on the radio that a big storm is approaching. Shaggy wonders how there could be any reception so high up, and Pemba tells him there isn't, its just the weather station man pretending to be a DJ. Pemba is annoyed that Minga did not leave the village, and thinks she just wants to see the weather station man, but she tells him there really is a storm. Everyone looks up and sees a dark cloud, and they decide to set up camp to wait out the storm. During the night, Jeffries gets out of his tent and leaves with his sled, which is filled with TNT and other explosives. Some time later, the Snowman attacks Shaggy and Scooby, who were standing watch. LaFleur tries to capture the Snowman, but all his traps backfire and work on him. Scooby and Shaggy manage to lose the Snowman but get lost themselves. However, they are relieved to see a snowplow approach them. In it is Del Chillman, whom the gang had meet before. Del takes them to the weather station, where he works. Chillman tells them he decided to take the job so he could find out if the legend of the creature is true. He also reveals that he is the DJ. He had the radio just to do weather reports, but plays songs to pass the time. Meanwhile, Fred, Velma, and Daphne get to the village and see it is deserted. They follow Shaggy‚Äôs tracks and see where the party camped the night before, and also the foot prints of the Snowman. Velma notes that they are not very deep in the snow. They find Pemba, who was caught by one of LaFleur's traps. Minga is nowhere to be found and Jeffries is still gone, so the gang decides to split up and search for everyone else. At the weather station, Chillman goes out to look for the others. Once he leaves the Snowman appears and attacks Shaggy and Scooby. As they run away, LaFleur shows up and tries to capture the creature, but falls of a cliff, apparently to his death.

However, this is also time for Jerry to get up. The mouse's alarm-watch rings and Jerry showers  and grooms himself before setting out for a tiny elevator in the wall. He hears Tom snoring and stops briefly before he enters the elevator and descends to a nightclub with a sign that says ""Le Cellar Smoqu√©""  displayed at its entrance.  Jerry arrives at the bar and has a martini . Then, Jerry begins playing drums with a band, which puts the club into full swing! Shortly afterward, being woken up by the noise, Tom opens the elevator, to get blasted at by the loud music. He tries to block the elevator doors with a pillow, but it's not enough to stop the noise. He lowers a hose into the elevator shaft in hopes of drowning out the noise. His smug laughter is interrupted by a large dog (originally [[Spike and Tyke , who drags Tom downstairs and throws him into his flooded apartment room. Dripping wet, Tom goes back to his own apartment room, and then decides to stop the noise at its source, by grabbing some tools and heading down to the basement through the air vents. Hearing the music through the floor, Tom saws a hole in the floor and uses the plunger, but the music is coming from a radio, and to make matters worse, the large dog  pulls Tom up through the floor and punches him back up to his apartment room through the floors and his bed. Now, completely bruised and sleep deprived, Tom cries over this and puts corks in his ears, wraps up his head with bandages and tries to settle down to sleep. Thankfully, the music stops, causing Tom to wake up with a start, lose the bandages, and pop the corks. Then a tired Jerry is seen leaving the elevator toward his hole. Tom gleefully goes back to sleep, only to be awoken seconds later by his alarm clock, then, however, having been woken up by the noise, Jerry turns on the light in his mousehole, peeks out, and makes a shushing noise at Tom, but this action from Jerry immediately causes Tom to scream  and run straight out through the wall, leaving his outline behind, and Jerry just shrugs this off, thinking Tom's gone bonkers, imitates Charlie Chaplin's silent film walk while going back to bed, and the cartoon ends."

The film opens with Saajan travelling in a bus, when he catches a glimpse of Kaajal on another bus, and they are both smitten. They do not formally meet and, since Saajan is off to start at college, he does not think he will ever see her again. But his new friends at college, Buddha, Tempo and Refill, one night insist that they all visit a brothel in a seedier part of Bombay. Saajan only reluctantly agrees, but ultimately refuses to select a prostitute &mdash; until he hears a new girl being beaten by her pimp and decides to protect her. To his surprise, it is Kaajal , who has been kidnapped by a pimp after she was tricked by a job offer in Bombay. Kaajal, who has only very recently arrived at the brothel and is still a virgin, has adamantly refused to be a prostitute. This is why Jaggu, who runs the brothel, is beating her. When finally alone with Saajan as a paying client , Kaajal explains to him how she was forced to look for work after her parents' deaths: This ultimately led to her travelling to Bombay and being kidnapped by Dhanraj then forced to work in Jaggu's brothel. Thanks to Leelabai, the madame who helps run the brothel, Saajan is able to spend time with Kaajal, and Kaajal is somehow able to resist becoming a prostitute. Saajan and Kaajal fall in love, and he tries to find a way to get her out of the brothel before Kaajal gives up hope. When Saajan is finally able to introduce Kaajal to his parents, they &mdash; not surprisingly &mdash; reject the idea of his marrying a girl from a brothel, even if she was taken there against her will and is from a respectable family. Since Saajan's father, Col. Sood, was already angry with his son for refusing to follow family tradition and join the Indian army, this is the last straw. Saajan is kicked out of his house. He becomes, in his own words, a rebel, a word which is repeated several times in the movie. Since Kaajal is already rebelling against Jaggu because she believes in love, they are now both ""rebels for love."" With the help of Saajan's college friends, they help Kaajal escape the brothel and flee to Ooty, near where her grandparents live. But just as they are about to be married with Kaajal's grandparents' consent, if not Saajan's father's, police arrive take them back to Bombay, where they claim he's wanted for kidnapping ""Paro"". Saajan's father, on hearing of his heroics fighting Dhanraj's men to rescue Kaajal, suddenly has a new-found respect for his son, who had previously been a lazy drifter. With the help of Saajan's three friends, Col. Sood finds his son outside Jaggu's brothel. There the ""police""  have returned Saajan and Kaajal to Dhanraj, who is preparing to punish them for her leaving the brothel. The intervention of Leelabai on Kaajal's behalf leads to yet another fight, with several people switching alliances."

Samuel Fulton is an old and lonely New York millionaire who has decided to leave his fortune to the family of the late Millicent Blaisdell. Millicent is the only woman he has ever been in love with and they shortly dated, until she dumped him because she did not return his love. Samuel explains to his lawyer Edward Norton that losing the love of his life was what inspired him to build up a career as a wealthy businessman, eventually becoming the richest man in the world. Fearing the family will spend the money the wrong way, he decides to visit them in a small Vermont town, faking a newspaper advertisement to board a room under the alias John Smith. The family is initially reluctant to take in Samuel, but Roberta, the youngest daughter, wastes no time and makes him feel as welcome as possible. He notices that the Blaisdells are a happy family who, although poor, are proud of their background. Father Charles has taught the family not to put a value on materialistic products. Nevertheless, mother Harriet wishes for her daughter Millicent to marry Carl Pennock, a wealthy but snobbish young man who could buy Millicent everything that Harriet never had. Millicent, however, is not keen on Carl and prefers to marry Dan Stebbins, a charming but poor soda jerk. While staying at the Blaisdells, 'John' is given a job at Dan's store. One night, Millie and Dan announce their engagement, which upsets Harriet. Shortly after, Norton arrives, announcing the family has inherited $100,000 from an unknown man. When realizing Norton is not joking, the family ‚Äì especially Harriet ‚Äì immediately gives up their humble life for the upper-class life style. Charles is not enthusiastic of his wife's sudden craze of materialism, but allows her to buy whatever she wants. The oldest son Howard immediately starts gambling a large amount of money and lands a debt, which prompts Samuel to help him. Meanwhile, Dan, feeling he could never live up to Millie's expectations, breaks off their engagement. Afterwards, Millie reluctantly starts dating Carl again, much under the pressure of her mother. Samuel helps both Millie and Howard escape from a raid, which results in his being jailed. Soon, Harriet feels that Samuel's presence is ruining the family image, unaware of the reason why he ended up in jail. In this period, he is supported only by Dan, who admits his intentions of leaving town to build a career. Trying to prevent Millie and Dan from disappearing out of each other's life, he sets up a meeting at the cinema. There, an argument follows, and Millie exclaims her hatred for the family's sudden wealth, complaining that it is the cause of all bad things happening to her. She is comforted by Samuel, and thereby attracts the attention of other theatre-goers, who suspect that Sam and Millie are in a scandalous affair. During a social party, there is gossip of the so-called affair, which prompts Harriet to force Millie to announce her engagement to Carl. Meanwhile, Charles announces he has lost his investments, which makes Samuel realize that the Blaisdells are in no position of making wise financial decisions. Obligated by Samuel, Norton refuses a loan, after which Charles begs the Pennocks for money. Carl then realizes that Millie is not from a wealthy family and leaves her. Much to Harriet's distress, the Blaisdell family returns to their old lifestyle. At the end, Roberta reveals that 'John' has won the first prize at an art show, having secretly entered his paintings. Samuel immediately leaves the house to avoid the press, and realizes that the Blaisdells now think of him as the grandfather he could have been.

One of the undercover cops , Anand is exposed by the terrorists a few years later, but he consumes cyanide and dies before they can get any info from him. Now Shiv is left alone in the gang.

This man is apprehended and interrogated by Abhay. He agrees to help the police for the safety of his family, but soon is poisoned in jail itself by a corrupt cop, Inspector tiwari . Soon one of Abhay and Lodhi's trusted and highly respected officers, and good friends, IGP Pathak , commits suicide when the CBI come to arrest him on charges of being linked with the terrorists. This comes as a rude shock for Abhay and Lodhi. They now relaize that there are people all over who seem to be linked with the terrorists. Now Bhadra offers Abhay the chance to join with and help the terrorists, or else his family will be in danger. Abhay does not oblige . The terrorists shoot at the family dog,killing it, shoot at Abhay's son's leg and injure him, and send messages directly and indirectly to threaten him. Abhay finally agrees. Bhadra asks for Abhay to sham a fake kidnap drama and allow him to escape, which he unwillingly does. Lodhi is shocked at Bhadra's escape but he does not understand why Abhay is acting strangely. Now outside, Bhadra soon send two people, Surinder  and Mala to stay in Abhay's house, and asks the latter to accommodate them. The two of them keep Bhadra informed about everything, and threaten to kill Abhay's wife and child if he were to try anything funny at anytime. Only Abhay knows about their true identity. Soon Bhadra meets Abhay, and under threat of his wife and child being killed by Bhadra's signalling to the couple at their house , Abhay reveals that it was Lodhi who had arranged for two undercover cops to be sent to the gang, and only he knows 'who' Dhanush really is. Abhay also comes to know that Inspector Tiwari, who was supporting Bhadra, has been eliminated. The gang attacks Lodhi. He almost starts to finish them off when he sees that one of the people sent to capture him is Shiv, so he goes along with them. Lodhi is beaten but he does not reveal who the inside man is really. Soon he is killed accidentally by Bhadra's pistol. The shock of all that is happening is too much for Abhay to bear. he tells everything to Sumitra , who tells Abhay that as a Police officer, he had taken an oath to protect the nation, and he must go by that. She also says that she will take care of everyone and everything if he were not there. Consoled, Abhay is then called for a late night meeting by Bhadra again. When he leaves for Lodhi's house first, Surinder tries to attack and rape , a girl being taken care of by Abhay and his wife. At this point Mala orders Surinder at gunpoint to leave the girl , but Surinder shoots Mala. Sumitra sees all this, and in order to save , seduces Surinder. Once in the bedroom, she pushes Surinder off, and kills him with his own gun. Abhay Singh is informed and he returns home, and consoles his family and bids them goodbye. He goes to meet Bhadra, where he attacks the criminal and is overpowered and bound to a chair. With only Shiv in the room, Commander Bhadra asks Abhay about the inside man, and suddenly points the pistol at Shiv. Abhay jumps off, attacks Bhandra, breaks free and stabs him in the neck with the broken wood of the chair.On hearing the commotion, as the entire gang comes from outside to break in to the room, Abhay tells Shiv to shoot him, because then it will appear as though Abhay was killed when he attacked Bhadra, and Shiv being highly trusted, would become the new gang leader. A reluctant Shiv does so, just as the gang breaks in. Shiv declares himself to be the terrorist gang leader, and the others accept his leadership. Abhay Singh passes away in peace."

Heather accidentally wanders into the path of a speeding car. Brenda pulls her sister out of the way. The car stops, and its occupants are no stranger to Brenda. They're ""The Scars"", a gang of mid-level dope dealers: Fargo, leader Jake, Red, and Vince, the gang's meek and weak-willed ""pet"". Rather than get an apology, Brenda instead gets propositioned for sex and drugs by Jake, which she flatly refuses. The gang takes off. Brenda and her friends then happen upon the Scars' empty vehicle parked in an alley while the gang is delivering a collection beating to Fadden . The girls jump in the car and take off, shouting obscenities to the gang as they drive off. The gang unsuccessfully tries to catch the car on foot. They later find the car in a nearby alley with garbage strewn inside. The gang arrives at Vince's school to deliver another beating to Fadden, and while there, Red spots Heather among the crowd and suggests to Jake getting revenge for the car-trashing incident. As Heather is waiting in the gym for Brenda to take her home, Red sneaks into the gym. He talks to Heather and then tries to forcibly kiss her. She breaks away from him, but the other gang members have all the gym entrances covered. They drag the helpless girl to one of the locker rooms where they take turns at raping her. Jake, not wanting to take any chances with the local police, then kicks Heather in the head. The unresponsive and bloodied girl is then left in the locker room. Brenda returns from one of her routine Principal's office visits to the gym to collect her sister, and finds her gone. The girls spread out to search for her, and a hysterical Maria charges into the gym from the locker rooms screaming for Brenda, having made the grisly discovery. Heather is rushed to the hospital in critical condition. Brenda, frustrated at the slow pace of the investigation, goes out to a bar with her friends, where she confides her fears of losing Heather to a bartending friend, Charlene. Also at the same bar are The Scars, who are collecting again from Fadden. While there, the Scars are also trying to find Vince another ""date"" for the evening, by pulling over any woman within reach. One of them happens to be Francine. As they continue to pass her around, two men witnessing the scene go and tell Jake and his gang to leave her alone. A fight breaks out between the men and the Scars, and while Jake is delivering a beating to one, Francine sticks Jake in the back with a switchblade. Jake gets up and lunges towards Francine, but she is out of reach. The Scars show up at Vince's school again. Vince tells Jake that Heather's rape is all over the school. Jake tells Vince to forget about it, but he wants to know how to find Francine. Vince makes Jake promise that he won't hurt her, but simply scare her. They confront Francine on a bridge as she's walking home carrying her new bridal gown for her upcoming wedding to her boyfriend Richie. Francine spits in Jake's face, and he lifts her up over his head and throws her off the bridge railing and to her death. Unable to confront his conscience any longer, a hysterical Vince runs from the gang. He runs to Heather's hospital bedside and tries to apologize to the comatose girl for his actions, but Brenda runs him off. With Francine missing, Brenda fears the worst and decides to take action. Dressed in a leather suit and armed with a switchblade, bear traps and crossbow, she takes off. In the meantime, her mother gets the call telling them that Francine is dead. Her mother tries to stop Brenda, but it's too late. At Vince's house, Brenda tricks her way in by telling his father that she needs his help for a homework assignment. She makes her way to his bedroom, where she sees him packing to run. At knife-point, Vince tells Brenda that Francine is dead and that he couldn't do anything to stop it. She spares Vince' life after he tells her where to find the gang. Fearing for his life, Vince goes to work and gets a loan from his boss, telling her he'll be back after things cool down. Unbeknown to Vince, Jake is parked in the alley with his headlights dimmed, waiting for Vince. Jake speeds towards him, knocking him down, presumably dead. Meanwhile, Brenda is waiting for Fargo and Red as they return to their ""home"" in a warehouse. She first confronts Fargo and launches a crossbow arrow into his throat. Moments later, Red stumbles upon Fargo's body, and is caught in the bear traps. Jake returns to the warehouse, pounding on the door for Fargo and Red to open it. Not getting a response, he raises the overhead door and sees the two strung-up bodies of his fallen gang-mates. Brenda's voice calls off from a distance, telling him he's next. Jake pulls out a pistol and fires in every direction, hoping one of the bullets will hit her. Brenda responds by launching an arrow into both of his thighs. Jake stumbles towards the warehouse gate, but Brenda has a snare trap in wait, suspending him upside down by his ankles. However, Jake manages to distract her, and pull the gate's door towards her, knocking her down. He manages to free himself and climb on top of her, but she escapes to another warehouse full of paints and solvents. Armed with a can of solvent, she manages to squirt Jake with the can's contents as he tries to strangle her. She pulls a cigarette lighter out and sets him on fire just as she's about to pass out. A screaming Jake, now on fire, flees the warehouse and stumbles into the parking lot, presumably dead, as police arrive on the scene. Brenda and her friends, including a fully recovered Heather, go to Francine's grave site. Though according to the girls, Brenda ""made things right"", her actions still did not bring back Francine."

She has a broom ready to hit Jerry but instead she clumsily hits Tom on the head causing Tom to forget who he is and he believes he is a mouse. Mammy asks Tom if he is okay but he starts to squeak she becomes scared and jumps onto a kitchen chair. Tom terrorises Mammy by shaking the chair causing her to fall off it, then quickly flees from the deranged cat. Tom then heads over to the refrigerator and grabs a piece of cheese, before entering Jerry's mouse hole. Tom then moves into Jerry's small bed causing it to break underneath him. Jerry gets annoyed having to share with an oversized 'mouse'. Jerry then overhears Mammy on the phone talking to the doctor about Tom. He hears that Tom is suffering from amnesia. Seeing Tom approaching her with mischief on his mind, Mammy cuts her phone conversation short and attempts to evade him by walking away on stilts. Tom pulls the stilts from under her causing Mammy to fall and he runs back into the mouse hole.  Jerry then runs to get the medical encyclopedia to learn more about amnesia. He reads that ""memory can be restored by a sharp blow on the head"". Jerry whistles and gets Tom's attention with a piece of cheese. Jerry then hides behind a curtain with a baseball bat. Tom starts searching for Jerry and every time Jerry swings to hit Tom, Tom coincidentally moves out of the way, exhausting Jerry. Jerry then tries dropping a bowling ball onto a piece of wood where a piece of cheese is sitting. Tom comes out of the mouse hole and eats the cheese. Jerry drops the ball, launching Tom headfirst into the ceiling. This cures him of his amnesia, but when Tom lands back onto the wood, the bowling ball flies into the air and falls on his head, sending him back to his mouse-like state. Jerry then puts down a trail of cheese for Tom and he tries to drop a vase on his head. He misses. Jerry sets down another trail of cheese that leads under the piano. Jerry has tied a string to the piano leg and when Tom walks under the piano, Jerry pulls the leg out of the piano causing it to fall. Again, Jerry's attempts miss. Tom continues the trail through a door and an iron barely misses him as well. Tom reaches a big piece of cheese and Jerry cuts a rope tied to an anvil. But the anvil cuts off the back of his skin and crashes through the floor, again missing him. Jerry sits down disgusted, he's tried everything.  Tom then gives Jerry a piece of cheese, but Jerry doesn't want it and throws it away. It lands in an egg cup on the shelf, which rolls and knocks a dish, which rolls into a laundry basket and into the broom. The broom falls over and releases a door which holds the ironing board which hits Tom on the head curing him of his amnesia. Jerry lets out a happy scream and runs to his mouse hole. He kisses Tom and then lies down on his bed to relax. Tom also lies down right outside Jerry's mouse hole. Jerry looks outside and sees Mammy  reading the medical book and holding a baseball bat whilst creeping stealthily towards the sleeping cat. She says she is going to cure Tom of his amnesia with a blow to the head. Jerry motions to stop her but she hits Tom anyway, unknowingly bringing his amnesia back. Jerry returns to his mouse hole whilst Tom, after once again dealing with Mammy, re-enters the mouse-hole,and returns to his mouse-like state. Tom kicks Jerry out of his bed, lies on the bed and breaks it once again, leaving Jerry frustrated."

The ambulance takes the bodies and the police search the car. The police finds the cocaine that Brad had hidden in the car. Everybody comes back to the crash site after the police and the ambulance have gone. Brad searches the car to find his cocaine. All of the souls realize that Candice had died in the crash. The Soultaker reveals himself, materializing from within the car, and claims Brad's soul while the others are helpless to stop him, and flee. The others find a convenience store where they try to tell the cashier that someone is trying to kill them, but the cashier does not notice their presence. Assuming the man is ignoring them, they leave the store, and the Soultaker appears again and grabs Natalie, to claim her soul, but her resemblance to his past love stays his hand. Zack rescues Natalie and they both flee, leaving Tommy behind. Tommy runs back to the store, and pleads for help from the cashier, to no avail. Tommy attempts to gain his attention by breaking a soda bottle, but this only confuses the cashier. The Soultaker is about to claim Tommy, when the Angel of Death appears to collect Brad's soul, and to reprimand his subordinate for failing to take Natalie when he had the chance. After delivering Brad's soul, the Soultaker enters the store and claims Tommy's soul. Natalie and Zack are still fleeing with The Man behind them. The duo make it to Natalie's house. Before they open the door, Natalie's mother, Anna  opens the door. Zack and Natalie tells them about the Soultaker. Anna tells them that they will be safe inside. Anna tells Natalie that she will run a bath for Natalie, so she can relax. After Anna goes upstairs, Natalie apologizes to Zack for the loss of his friend. Zack also apologizes about the cocaine in the car. Natalie goes upstairs. When she gets upstairs Natalie and Anna talks about Natalie's relationship with Zack. Natalie tells Anna that she will go to her room and lie down. When Natalie goes lie down, she falls asleep and dreams about being taken to the hospital. Anna wakes her to tell Natalie that the tub is full. Meanwhile, downstairs Zack hears something growling in the kitchen. When he goes to investigate, it was only the family dog, Charlie. Zack tells Charlie that no one will hurt him. It is shown that the reason Charlie is growling is because he can't see Zack, but can sense his presence. Back upstairs, Natalie gets ready to bathe, and it is revealed that her mother is watching her undress. While watching T.V., the news comes on and reports about the car crash. One of the reporters interviewing Natalie's father Grant reports that with parents permission the life support systems for Natalie and Zack will be shut of at midnight. Zack sees Anna on the news. Natalie discovers her mother watching her, and is disgusted, then horrified when her mother suddenly morphs into the Man that has been pursuing them. Instead of attacking her, The Soultaker attempts to make a pact with her, offering her eternal life, with the one proviso being that she stay by his side forever. Zack arrives and attempts to attack the Soultaker, but is easily overpowered. Natalie gets her father's shotgun and shoots the Man, to no effect, as the Soultaker reveals his nature by claiming that she ""can't kill a man that is already dead."" The two manage to escape and flee to the hospital to return to their bodies before midnight before their life support systems will be shut off. In the hospital, Natalie is captured by the Man on an elevator which leads to the afterlife. The Man claims he is an angel and his duty it to collect the souls of the dying. He manages to convince Natalie that there is nothing left for her in living realm, and that Zack is already dead, but she can be saved if she stays with him. While searching for Natalie, Zack encounters Brad, who has become a grim reaper. Brad reveals that those who take a life, even if accidentally, they must pay for it through service as a grim reaper. Brad gives Zach two empty soul rings to help Zach and Natalie into their bodies, and helps him rescue Natalie from the Soultaker. Natalie places herself in the ring over her body, but she still remains comatose. Zach discovers that a pendant she was wearing somehow acted as a barrier between her soul and her body, and he pulls her soul from her body and is about to attempt to return her to her body again, when the Soultaker appears again. The Soultaker chases Zack all the way to the top of the hospital, and corners him on the roof. Zach remembers that he is a soul and is no longer bound by death or pain, and escapes by leaping off the roof. The Soultaker is about to give chase, but is confronted by the Angel of Death once again. The Angel of Death informs him that it is past midnight and that the Soultaker has failed, for if the two died now, their souls would be lost forever. The Soultaker pleas with the Angel, promising that he can correct these errors, but is beyond forgiveness, and is collected into a soul ring by his master. The movie ends with Zack visiting Natalie in the hospital on the day of her release. Zack is greeted happily by Natalie's parents who used to not care for Zack at all. The two go outside to see that Zack finally fixed up his old car and the two kiss and drive off together."

Told by Buford's mother-in-law Loyce   that their father is dying, his four adult children arrive at the family's homestead to spend time with their father during his last days. It's a mixed bag of personalities: Lurlene , the eldest sister, a minister's wife who rarely visits the rest of the family; Sara Lee , the spinsterish middle sister who cares for her father with the help of her grandmother; Orville , the greedy, abusive brother, and his wife, Marlene ; and the youngest sibling Evalita , the six-times married aspiring country singer, who brings her hippie boyfriend Harmony . All arrive at the Turnover homestead, and personalities clash. Eldest sister Lurlene irritates her siblings as she tries to take control of the situation, causing resentment by acting too much like their deceased mother Linnie Sue . She is a bit estranged from the rest of the family, having only returned to the homestead every few years since she married and moved away, leaving her father to try to run the farm alone. For this reason, Lurlene suspects that she has been cut out of the will. However, Lurlene has few altercations with her siblings and tries to keep the peace among them. Sara Lee also tries to act as peacemaker, until Evalita has a drunken night at the bar with Clarence , to whom Sara Lee is engaged . Evalita implies that she and Clarence had slept together, though Clarence denies the event. Orville frequently verbally abuses Marlene, often criticizing her weight and parenting skills.  Orville is rarely seen without a beer in his hand. Marlene is preoccupied with her weight and is quite unhappy with her husband and life. She and her sisters-in-law and grandmother-in-law get along very well, and Marlene quickly forms a close bond with Harmony as well. Evalita is constantly drunk and makes her family uncomfortable during very public displays of affection with Harmony. She spends most of her time not at home with her dying father, but at the local bar, singing. On one occasion, she forgets her own age. Harmony is initially distrusted by the family, but eventually manages to win the family over  when he demonstrates his piano playing ability by playing ""I'll Fly Away"" on the family piano. As everybody gathers together to sing along, Buford hears the music and rises from his bed, watching his grown son and daughters sing. He sees them as small children, singing with their mother. When Harmony and Marlene secretly share a joint, he tells her that he is falling in love with her, and asks her to run away with him. She refuses, but they end up kissing in the kitchen and nearly get caught by Orville. Eventually, Mama Wheelis remembers that Buford kept his will in a strong box buried in the yard. Harmony helps open the box by picking the lock, telling the family that he had once served time in prison for burglary. Evalita, again drunk, berates him for this and Harmony leaves. The will is read, and though all the siblings had been forgiven by their father in an earlier scene, the will hadn't been changed and Lurlene and Orville each receive only $1 of the $600,000 estate. Jimbo receives what would have been his father's share in the estate. Sara Lee offers to share her inheritance with Orville and Lurlene, but Evalita refuses to give up any of hers. Harmony returns to tell Evalita that he has thrown her belongings out of his van, and that he is going back to California. Marlene quickly grabs her suitcase and leaves with Harmony. Buford eventually dies, and the family converges in the living room for the funeral. They begin to practice the song they will sing at the funeral, and an image of Buford can be seen, watching. Again, he sees his adult children as young children. In their newfound peace, the will is temporarily forgotten."

The film abruptly flashes back to a few weeks before, to a Chinese restaurant where a high school boy named Arthur buses tables, and his ex-babysitter, Annie, and her best friend, Barb, are waitresses. Arthur, who's a bit of a misfit, has a troubled home life caused by his constantly clashing parents, both of whom often forget about him. Annie's life isn't faring much better: she's now a single mother with an ill mother, separated from her husband, Glenn, who's on the wagon and becoming a born-again Christian in order to prove that he is responsible enough to spend time with their young daughter, Tara. Depressed and lonely, Annie is having an affair with Barb's husband, Nate, which eventually serves to only make her unhappier, as she feels great guilt over betraying her best friend. Desperate to prove himself and still harboring feelings for his estranged wife , Glenn gets a new job and spends as much time as possible with Tara. Meanwhile, Arthur finds himself growing close to Lila, a new student at the high school who has a knack for photography. The film focuses heavily on how people's lives can cross in a small town, especially when Tara wanders out of the house and goes missing while Annie, having just lost her best friend over the affair, is sleeping. The whole town spends hours desperately searching for Tara, before Arthur finds her body while smoking pot with his friend. To Annie's horror, Tara fell into the lake while playing and drowned when the water froze over. This turn of events leads to Glenn having a complete breakdown, which results in his murder of Annie and subsequent suicide.

Desperate to prove himself and still harboring feelings for his estranged wife , Glenn gets a new job and spends as much time as possible with Tara. Meanwhile, Arthur finds himself growing close to Lila, a new student at the high school who has a knack for photography. The film focuses heavily on how people's lives can cross in a small town, especially when Tara wanders out of the house and goes missing while Annie, having just lost her best friend over the affair, is sleeping. The whole town spends hours desperately searching for Tara, before Arthur finds her body while smoking pot with his friend. To Annie's horror, Tara fell into the lake while playing and drowned when the water froze over. This turn of events leads to Glenn having a complete breakdown, which results in his murder of Annie and subsequent suicide.

When a man he zealously prosecuted all the way to the electric chair is found innocent, he becomes distressed and quits his job. At the suggestion of a friendly bartender, he decides to switch teams and become a defense attorney specializing in the representation of gangsters and other unsavory people. He will use any tactic to get his clients acquitted, up to and including drinking a slow-acting poison from a bottle of evidence to prove that the substance isn't lethal. The jury acquits the man not knowing that immediately after, Day rushes into a Mob doctor's office for a pre-arranged stomach pump. Celia Farraday is a young secretary recently arrived in the city from a small town in Kentucky. When Day makes play for her, she spurns his advances, loyal to her fiance, Johnny. When the fiance is framed for a crime committed by one of Day's clients, Day's affection for Celia not only prompts Day to defend Johnny by implicating his client in the crime, but to reconsider his life of getting criminals out of jail sentences. However, his associates send him a message that his departure will not be allowed. He lets them know that he has all of their secrets in a safe-deposit box, along with instructions for the bank to forward the contents to the District Attorney in the event of his unnatural death. They call his bluff and he is shot while leaving his office to attend Celia's wedding. On the way to the hospital, he tells his faithful secretary that the criminals were wrong to call his bluff and that the information will be on the way to the DA. The movie leaves it ambiguous whether Day, shot several times, will survive his wounds.

He prepares to take a trip to New York City via a ferry steamboat from Richmond, Virginia, to Baltimore, and from there, another ferry to New York City itself. He discusses his plans to marry his childhood sweetheart Sarah Elmira Royster with a stranger taking the same steamboat, who suggests that he meet with a few potential investors for his planned magazine The Stylus. Though Poe had intended only to pass through Baltimore, he agrees to meet the investors who, one by one, turn down his request for funding. Poe is depicted as having some type of memory loss, which is first evident when he offers to pay his boat fare twice after forgetting he had already paid. In Baltimore, he more than once forgets the arrangements he has made at his hotel as his stay in the city is extended. One night, he chooses to dine in a local tavern rather than at the hotel. There, he meets an old friend from his days at West Point. In desperation, he asks his former classmate and the classmate's companion for money to help start a magazine, saying proudly he has already raised $1,000. Poe leaves the tavern to retrieve his prospectus for the magazine. His classmate follows him and beats him up to steal the $1,000 he had collected. An injured and delirious Poe is then found by organizers of a cooping ring. The author, along with several others, are forced to multiple polling locations around Baltimore to place multiple votes for the candidate for mayor. A couple of victims of the scam die amidst the brutality of their captors. Afterwards, Poe is released and he eventually collapses in the street and is found by a local tavern owner. The man calls for Poe's uncle Henry Herring and Dr. Joseph Snodgrass. The men discuss what to do with the incoherent, half-conscious Poe. Snodgrass assumes he is drunk and suggests they let him sleep it off - a theory the film seems to dispute by showing him early in the film declining offered alcohol several times. Herring becomes more concerned and demands Poe be taken to Washington College Hospital, despite the expense. At the hospital, Dr. John Moran tends to Poe, unable to accurately determine his situation or the cause of his failing health, or how he received his injuries. He muses to his wife, Mrs. Moran, that he does not want to be known as the physician who killed Edgar Allan Poe. Over the next three days, the bedridden Poe is kept in seclusion in a private room as Moran denies Poe visitors, including his Baltimore cousin Nielson Poe, who becomes convinced that his cousin is about to die. Poe ultimately does die after one final hallucination or perhaps a flashback where he sees his dead wife Virginia Clemm.

In the beginning, Hern√°n helps his brother and his wife get ready for a their big move to Spain. His parents are forced to leave Argentina in order to escape the ravages of the country's economic crisis. Hern√°n is left alone in the Buenos Aires suburbs. He works at an agency delivering messages on a small motorcycle. One day, at a gas station, he meets Pato, an attractive woman working the pumps. Hern√°n invites Pato to rent the room his brother vacated. Pato is a mysterious young woman. She realizes Hern√°n likes her and she decides to go along in returning his advances. Yet, Hern√°n is quite surprised when he comes home one night. Pato's parents and her young daughter have moved in without giving Hern√°n a warning. The father, Venancio , a slick character, thanks Hern√°n, who thinks the move-in is temporary. However, it seems that Pato's parents have come to stay. Dispossession laws in Argentina can be quite lengthly and costly. Venancio and his wife turn the kitchen into a small bakery making churros that are sold on the streets. Nothing that Hern√°n does to get rid of Pato's family who occupy the house. That is until he takes matters into his own hands and scares Pato's family. Pato, who is not able to have a relationship with Hern√°n, is being pursued by a handsome young man, Jose Luis, a client at the gas station. Pato realizes a her chance when she discovers that Jose Luis is much wealthier than Hern√°n. Venancio, his wife, and the young girl appear at Jose Luis' building. In the next scene, Venancio is seated at the dinner table thanking Jose Luis with the same speech he used to thank Hern√°n.

A suspicious barn fire is followed by the theft of the horse. From the point of view of Ishak , the sheik who took him, this is property retrieval; the horse was originally his, and the Black's name is Shetan. Although he learns that the horse is being returned to the sheik's kingdom in the Moroccan desert, Alec goes after the sheik, stowing away in a plane to Casablanca. In Morocco, after being found on the plane, Alec is taken to the American embassy, where the police plan on sending him home. At the stables, he makes some friends who disguise him as a local Casablancan. They take him to a man named Kurr , who is very interested in the horse and the sheik, and allows Alec to go with him and his companion. But after getting a flat tire, they abandon Alec in the desert. He is found by the driver of another truck and given a ride. Aboard the truck, he meets Raj , who tells him the Black will probably compete in ""The Great Race."" The two become friends and travel across the desert on foot with Meslar , Raj's friend and mentor. Then a rogue tribe kidnaps Meslar, and Raj and Alec defend themselves against the harsh elements. After running out of water, they collapse from dehydration but recover when they find a river. Raj's tribe discovers them, welcoming Raj home and Alec to the tribe. Raj takes Alec to the outskirts of Ishak's home, and he reunites with the Black. While attempting to retrieve the horse, Alec is apprehended by Ishak's men. He pleads his case to Ishak, who is sympathetic but will not give up the horse. He plans to race the Black in the ""Great Race"" with his granddaughter Tabari  as jockey. Alec insists the Black can win the race only if he, not Tabari, rides him. Denied the position, he coaches Tabari on riding the horse, but the Black throws her off. A rogue tribe led by Kurr then captures the Black and Alec and takes them away. Later, Alec escapes with the Black. As they flee, Alec discovers that Meslar is alive and being held prisoner. He gives Meslar his pocket knife to help him get free of his bonds. Alec and the Black escape and go back to Ishak's home. As a reward for the safe return of the horse, Alec is allowed to ride him in the race. On the day of the race, Alec reunites with Raj, who is also competing, and they begin their run across the desert along with the other riders. The rogue tribe's rider tries to kill Alec, but he and the Black escape. Alec discovers that the rogue rider pushed Raj off his horse, and he brings Raj's mount back to him.

A suspicious barn fire is followed by the theft of the horse. From the point of view of Ishak , the sheik who took him, this is property retrieval; the horse was originally his, and the Black's name is Shetan. Although he learns that the horse is being returned to the sheik's kingdom in the Moroccan desert, Alec goes after the sheik, stowing away in a plane to Casablanca. In Morocco, after being found on the plane, Alec is taken to the American embassy, where the police plan on sending him home. At the stables, he makes some friends who disguise him as a local Casablancan. They take him to a man named Kurr , who is very interested in the horse and the sheik, and allows Alec to go with him and his companion. But after getting a flat tire, they abandon Alec in the desert. He is found by the driver of another truck and given a ride. Aboard the truck, he meets Raj , who tells him the Black will probably compete in ""The Great Race."" The two become friends and travel across the desert on foot with Meslar , Raj's friend and mentor. Then a rogue tribe kidnaps Meslar, and Raj and Alec defend themselves against the harsh elements. After running out of water, they collapse from dehydration but recover when they find a river. Raj's tribe discovers them, welcoming Raj home and Alec to the tribe. Raj takes Alec to the outskirts of Ishak's home, and he reunites with the Black. While attempting to retrieve the horse, Alec is apprehended by Ishak's men. He pleads his case to Ishak, who is sympathetic but will not give up the horse. He plans to race the Black in the ""Great Race"" with his granddaughter Tabari  as jockey. Alec insists the Black can win the race only if he, not Tabari, rides him. Denied the position, he coaches Tabari on riding the horse, but the Black throws her off. A rogue tribe led by Kurr then captures the Black and Alec and takes them away. Later, Alec escapes with the Black. As they flee, Alec discovers that Meslar is alive and being held prisoner. He gives Meslar his pocket knife to help him get free of his bonds. Alec and the Black escape and go back to Ishak's home. As a reward for the safe return of the horse, Alec is allowed to ride him in the race. On the day of the race, Alec reunites with Raj, who is also competing, and they begin their run across the desert along with the other riders.

The dogs angrily expel Tom and the cat hides behind a tree. Jerry, however, is sitting on Spike's back, and he taunts Tom. Tom notices a fake dog with a head attached near a pet shop. Realizing he must disguise himself in order to reach Jerry, Tom sneaks off and steals the head. He now walks and crawls like a dog until he reaches a lamppost. He puts the head to the side so if dogs see him, they'll think it's a dog, and peeks at the dog pound. Seeing it's all clear, Tom sneaks in through the bars, but loses the head in the process. He attempts to pull it out when Spike notices him. Tom puts himself back under the head and barks. Convinced that the dog is new to the dogpound, Spike walks away. Tom successfully frees the head and runs to the center of the dog pound to keep a lookout. Jerry sneaks up behind him and imitates barking. Tom is startled out of his wits and has dug through some of the wall when he figures out it's Jerry. Jerry continues imitating a dog and then runs away. Tom chases after him and looks under various dogs to find the mouse, and then spots him in a bone-hat. Tom bolts after the mouse and Jerry hides. Convinced that the end of the dog bone nearby is Jerry in disguise, Tom grabs it and is met by an angry Spike. As Spike chomps down, Tom causes Spike to swallow his bone and flees to underneath a St. Bernard. The big dog goes to sleep and Tom pops out from under the dog - but without the dog head. Tom digs back under the St. Bernard, waking it up. Tom is hanging from the collar without the dog head and if anyone notices him, he's doomed. Fortunately, the St. Bernard notices nothing. Tom then attaches the head to his rear and pops out again, waking the dog again. The St. Bernard sees Tom sans head, but Tom switches ends and leaves. Tom hides in a barrel to keep lookout, but soon notices that Jerry is doing the same. He breaks open the barrel and chases Jerry until Jerry hides in the fur of another dog. Jerry taunts him by swimming in the fur and gets Tom to dive in too. This wakes up the dog and he shakes both cat and mouse out of his fur, apparently confused . As the chase resumes, Jerry holds back, trips Tom, and gains the dog head for himself. Spike comes around the corner and briefly sees Tom's real head, but Tom hides it fast. Jerry leaves and Tom, apparently with no head at all, waves and follows after him. Thinking he's seen a headless dog, Spike emits a terrified shriek like a woman. Tom waddles after his ""head"", but fails to spot the pole in his way and he bumps into it, returning to normal. Seeing dog ears like the ones on the dog head in a nearby barrel, Tom grabs them and is met with an angry yellow dog. Tom ties up his mouth with his own collar and panickedly runs away. Tom sees Jerry/head follow the path close to him and prepares to seize him; unfortunately, Spike is also coming around the corner. Tom grabs Spike and tries to fit him over his head. When he can't move after a few steps, Tom realizes something is up and sees the dog chomping at him. Tom hides behind a wall and soon spots Jerry/head. In his path, though, is a long Dachshund dog akin to a train stop. The dog apparently has two heads....until Jerry reveals himself and sticks his tongue out at Tom only to run into the dog's house. Jerry dashes off and Tom traps him underneath the head, but soon realizes that's his means of disguise and sticks it over his head just as Spike arrives. Jerry raises the head and turns the head in an effort to expose Tom until Spike lifts the head himself, whereupon Tom covers all of himself with the head and waddles off. Tom lifts the head and whacks himself in an effort to flatten Jerry, but only causes a bump on his head. Because of this, Tom can no longer hide himself when Spike comes around, and finally sees through Tom's disguise. Jerry holds up a note stating ""YES STUPID IT'S A CAT"". Spike lets out an angry massive buffalo roar and the jig is up. Tom panics and digs a hole, but Spike digs him up with his large jaws. The chase wakes up all the other dogs, who join the chase themselves, as they are now on the warpath against Tom. Tom is chased to the top of a very high pole, with all the dogs barking at him. Then Jerry, who has donned the dog head, starts barking at Tom, but stop barking as they now hear Jerry barking. He loses the head, but jumps down, retrieves it and continues barking at Tom as the cartoon ends."

Having been blind from birth, he volunteers for a risky experimental visual prosthesis that may restore his sight -- having a microchip installed in the visual cortex of his brain that connects to a camera that would give him only, at best, fuzzy black and white images. During the tests he meets a beautiful Indian nurse, Leeza . Meanwhile, because Danny is a virgin at 22, his brother Larry , who runs a limousine service, gets him a string of hilariously disastrous blind dates in between rentals. When Danny finally realizes that he is falling for Leeza, she tells him she cannot see him anymore because she has been promised in an arranged marriage. Believing that Leeza did not pursue their relationship because of his being blind, Danny becomes depressed and stops taking the necessary tests for his brain surgery. Danny's family, his eccentric psychotherapist Dr. Evans ([[Jane Seymour  and eye doctor Dr. Perkins  advise him to continue because it is his only chance of seeing, and soon Danny is successfully operated on.

Coyote, standing on the road, pulls out an arrow-shaped sign saying ""Coyote"" and another saying ""Apetitius Giganticus"". The Road Runner speeds by with a Beep-beep and ruffles the coyote's fur. Wile flips the signs to read ""Road-Runner"" and ""Fastius Tasty-us"", and winds up his legs, followed by his body, and chases the Road Runner. When the Road Runner sees the Coyote chasing him, he taunts him and gears into superspeed. This causes the road to roll up, a tunnel to turn inside-out, and a bridge to be destroyed as he puts his would-be predator far behind. Wile E. stops short of the chasm, panting, and two light bulbs signal his new-found idea. 1. Wile E. prepares himself to chase the Road Runner with his new roller skis, and skis off the plateau down the mountain and onto the road that the Road Runner is dashing over. As the camera cuts separately to Wile and the Road Runner, the bird turns across a U-turn at the end of a cliff, while Wile speeds off. When Wile E. realizes his mistake, he drops the ski poles, and soon slams into the side of another cliff. The Coyote looks up and down, trying to figure out how to escape, until he hears and sees the Road Runner at the top of the cliff. The skis provide a rather convenient ""spring"" for Wile E., who uses them to get closer and closer to grabbing the Road Runner. Eventually, he grabs within millimeters of his opponent, but unfortunately, the downward force and Wile's weight is too much for the skis to handle this time, and the Coyote suffers gravity. 2. The Road Runner beeps at Wile E. from across the canyon, and the camera pans to the Coyote attempting to shoot himself over the canyon with a bow. Before he can fire himself, the very end of the cliff crumbles and the bow tips over the side. Wile E. flips himself over in the air, but this causes him to bounce up and get his head stuck inside the edge of the cliff. The Coyote initiates a new plan. 3. Wile E. lights a needle-nosed dart bomb and throws it at a target attached to a cactus, exploding all three items. He then gets in a hot air balloon with an artillery of dart bombs. He sees the Road Runner zipping over the road and lights the bombs. Upon lighting, the bombs circle in the air but the last one lands in the Coyote's balloon, blowing it up. He waves at the camera and falls toward the ground, but stops himself by releasing a parachute. Unfortunately, dart #2 blows this up, and Wile E. is left to wave at the camera with an AGAIN sign before he plummets again. A third dart follows him to the ground and explodes. 4. Wile E. gives the Road Runner a snack while he awaits with a hammer behind a turn. The Road Runner is heard approaching, but the camera immediately cuts to a fourth dart blowing up the hammer handle and the hammerhead landing on the Coyote's head. The blow causes Wile E.'s eyes to register ""TILT!"" in the manner of a pinball machine. 4. The Coyote hurls a newly acquired boomerang at the passing Road Runner, but it disappears behind a rock and comes back around with dart #5 attached and approaches him. The boomerang passes the fleeing Coyote and hovers over one spot. Wile stops moving, thinking he has outrun the bomb, but in reality it is right next to him and blows up before he can run away. 5. Wile now attempts a simple gun-in-the-woods trap, but a sixth bomb plugs the barrel and explodes. The camera cuts to a seventh bomb, which blows up under a huge boulder and sends it into the air, adding insult to injury to the Coyote when it flattens him. 6. As the Road Runner traverses another road, the Coyote is shown at the end of a cliff 900 feet in the air, holding an anvil ready to drop. An eighth bomb takes out a third of the cliff's edge, and two more darts pepper the floating end. Wile E. jumps onto the ""secure"" main cliff, but the entire cliff falls down. The Coyote pulls himself on top of the anvil to avoid getting bonked on the head with it. The anvil smashes through the ground, followed by Wile E. and the floating end of the cliff with the two darts. The Coyote covers his face with his ears to prepare for the worst, but instead of exploding the two darts unfurl into ""THE"" and ""END"". Wile E. pokes one eye out at both of them and laughs deeply."

As the Road Runner traverses another road, the Coyote is shown at the end of a cliff 900 feet in the air, holding an anvil ready to drop. An eighth bomb takes out a third of the cliff's edge, and two more darts pepper the floating end. Wile E. jumps onto the ""secure"" main cliff, but the entire cliff falls down. The Coyote pulls himself on top of the anvil to avoid getting bonked on the head with it. The anvil smashes through the ground, followed by Wile E. and the floating end of the cliff with the two darts. The Coyote covers his face with his ears to prepare for the worst, but instead of exploding the two darts unfurl into ""THE"" and ""END"". Wile E. pokes one eye out at both of them and laughs deeply."

Initially believed to be a bio-terrorist attack using an airborne neurotoxin, the behavior quickly spreads across the northeastern United States. Elliot Moore, a high school science teacher in Philadelphia, hears about the attacks and decides to go to Harrisburg by train with his wife, Alma. They are accompanied by his friend Julian and Julian's eight-year-old daughter Jess. Julian's wife is stuck in Philadelphia but is expected to meet them in Harrisburg. The train loses all radio contact en route and stops at a small town. They receive word that Philadelphia has been attacked and Julian's wife was not able to get on the train to Harrisburg. Julian decides to go look for her, leaving his daughter with the Moores. However, the town has already been hit by the toxin. Succumbing to it, the driver and Julian both commit suicide. Elliot, Alma and Jess hitch a ride with a nurseryman and his wife. The nurseryman believes that plants are responsible, as they can release chemicals to defend themselves from threats. The crew are joined by other survivors and split into two groups, with Elliot, Alma, and Jess in the smaller group. When the larger group is affected by the toxin, Elliot realizes that the plants are targeting only large groups of people. He splits their group into smaller pockets and they walk along, arriving at a model home. Two other groups arrive on the property, triggering a neurotoxin attack, signaled by what appears to be wind tossing the vegetation. The next house they come upon is sealed, its residents trying to protect themselves from the toxin. Elliot's attempts to reason with them are deemed unsuccessful when the residents shoot Josh and Jared, two teenage boys whom Elliot had earlier befriended. Elliot, Alma, and Jess next come upon the isolated house of Mrs. Jones, an elderly eccentric who has no outside contacts and is unaware of the current disaster. The following morning, Mrs. Jones becomes infected with the toxin. Realizing that the plants are now targeting individuals, Elliot locks himself in the basement but is separated from Alma and Jess, who are in the home's small outhouse. They are able to communicate through an old talking tube, and Elliot warns them of the threat. He expresses his love for her before deciding that if he is to die, he would prefer to spend his remaining time with her. The three leave the safety of their buildings and embrace in the yard, surprised to find themselves unaffected by the neurotoxin. The outbreak has abated as quickly as it began. Three months later, Elliot and Alma have adjusted to their new life with Jess as their adopted daughter. On television, an expert, comparing the event to a red tide, warns that the epidemic may have only been a warning. He states that humans have become a threat to the planet and that is why the plants have responded aggressively. Alma discovers she is pregnant and embraces Elliot with the news. In the Tuileries Gardens at the Louvre Palace in Paris, France, a scream is heard and everyone freezes in place as the wind rustles through the trees, signifying another attack.

Pepe's stench ruins a couple of sculptures as well as thwarting the ginger cat's ambush attempt and he terrifies Penelope in the sculpture galley, even as he paints her picture, she scurries away again. The ginger cat pumps himself with air in an attempt to hold his breath while he confronts Pepe. Pepe plays along the confrontation as a duel, miming a miss and a defeat. The ginger cat in the meantime suffocates and puffs out all the air he held in, launching himself into the Hall d'Armour. Pepe wonders where everyone has gone to and immediately picks up on where Penelope went. Pepe finds Penelope hiding in the Air Conditioning machine and traps her in it with himself. Pepe's fumes spread through the Louvre spoiling various works of art .

The film then cuts to Gulliver's arrival in Basra, Iraq with fellow soldier Mark Tate. Once there, they are briefed by their commanding officer, who tells them to treat the people of Iraq with respect. While on patrol the troops are ambushed by insurgents, and the men witness the death of their CO,Major Godber whilst trying to rescue a Territorial Army private who is struck with shock while in a Land Rover and is incapable of taking cover. After this the troops receive reports that the insurgents came from a village nearby. When the troops arrive in the said village, they arrest several men suspected of being insurgents, and take them back to their base. Once there, they are told to leave the prisoners to the Royal Military Police , but due to their anger over the death of their major, they begin to beat, torture and sexually abuse them. When Corporal Gant orders a reluctant Tate to join the troops he refuses at first, but is bullied into helping them. During the torture, Gulliver takes some photographs. After the torture scene, we see as they arrive home, they resume their normal lives, during which Gulliver shows his girlfriend the pictures of the torture. After she discovers that he has been cheating on her, she reports him to the civilian police. Gant, Gulliver and Tate are subsequently arrested by the RMP. Gant is fined, while the two privates are court-martialed. Upon hearing this, Tate kills himself. In the final scene of the films we see Gulliver's trial, he pleads guilty to all charges, but rather than solely take the blame he tells the court what Gant and the other soldiers did. When Gulliver is returned to his cell, he is beaten by his fellow soldiers.

Despite having secure income from his organized crime gangs in Moscow, Saint Peterburg and Samara as well as some legitimate business there, he takes joy in kidnapping, since that is more patriotic and militant than random crime. Both Ivan and his comrade Fedka were enslaved after they were taken prisoners in early 2000. They also had to share their accommodation with a commercial Russian-Jewish hostage Semyon from Vladikavkaz, who was held for ransom. However that particular day they were joined by two more, an English couple, theatre actors John Boyle ([[Ian Kelly  and his fianc√©e Margaret . They were kidnapped in Georgia during their tour there performing Shakespeare's Hamlet who John played. Ivan, having pre-draft experience with computers, knew a little English and not only was he a translator for John; he was also entrusted by Aslan to utilize the Internet for communication. The five shared shocking living conditions in a pit, and every once in a while the Chechens would show how far they would go to get their way, through actions like publicly beheading two Russian servicemen and severing Semyon's finger one by one for ransom delays. After a while of living in this ordeal, Semyon is dragged away  and the four are relocated to an even more remote base where their quarters are now a pit which is already occupied by a crippled Russian Captain Medvedev  , and although the captain is paralyzed by an injury, his mere presence is enough to raise everyone's spirit, in particular Margaret's and Ivan's. John's negotiations with England to secure the 2 million pound sterling ransom goes nowhere and Aslan becomes fed up, deciding to secure his the money by releasing John, along with Ivan and Petka , and keeping Margaret with an ultimatum of four weeks to get ¬£2 million - otherwise, she is to be raped and beheaded. Both Ivan and Petya are discharged from the Army and Ivan visits Medvedev's family in Saint Petersburg before going returning to his home city of Tobolsk. John's ""rescue"" gains him prominence back home in London, but his attempts to secure any help from the British authorities fail, as none wish to pay ransom to terrorists. Realising that he has to sell everything off, he is approached by a Channel 4 representative who offers him ¬£400,000 in return for concise documentary footage of his travels. Accepting the offer, John rushes to Moscow; however, all Russian authorities refuse to undertake the exchange as, again, none negotiate with terrorists . The farthest John gets is an offer to purchase a telephone number of an ex-KGB operative who lives in Vladikavkaz and specialises in ransom exchanges. John next travels to Tobolsk, to find Ivan there and hire him as his translator. Back home, Ivan finds that few positive changes have occurred during his two year absence: his parents have separated, some of his friends were killed in local gang wars, and the prospects of building a career are as dim as ever, even more for a  veteran like himself. However, what got him to follow John was not the prospect of what was left of the ¬£35 thousand John had with him, but out of his respect for the Captain and his family. Stocking up at an army surplus store the pair head off to Vladikavkaz, but the promised ex-KGB operative turns out to be nothing but a common crook. Desperate, Ivan decides to go and find Aslan alone and do the exchange by himself. Luckily he bumps into a soldier who is about to leave for Chechnya. Both he and John are smuggled in a truck, under a tarpaulin past the checkpoints, in exchange for Ivan's  combat boots. Once there, the two first ambush and commandeer a Land Rover, stocked with arms and driven by Chechen terrorists. In the ensuring firefight Ivan kills all four terrorists, but inside the jeep a woman is also killed. The reality of this catches up with John and emotionally he nearly breaks down that war was not what he came to witness, Ivan in turn is pissed off because all the time he has helped him and in return John was not able to kill anyone in the ambush. The next morning however John pulls himself together and the pair come across a lone Chechen shepherd Ruslan Shamayev  on a bus stop. Ivan beats him up and falsely leads him to believe that his unit will kill all his family should he not regularly report in. In return Ruslan promises to lead them to Gugayev. The path requires the three to ditch the Jeep and walk across a glacier, and through ridges that were deserted since the 1944 deportation. The initial hostility and distrust dies down, as Ruslan fully cooperates and when approaching Aslan's camp  tells Ivan of the standing clanal blood feud between the Shamayevs and Guguayevs. He promises to help Ivan out of his good will, in return for his aid in enrolling his son into Moscow's University. By the time they reach their destination Ivan trusts Ruslan with firearms. The three then assault the camp, where despite Aslan's oath to Allah that neither Margaret nor the Captain will be hurt, John discovers Margaret naked and bruised, with obvious signs of rape. Enraged, he chases after Aslan and guns him down with a pistol. Aslan's death was never intended, as Ivan hoped to use him in negotiating a safe passage and then paying him off with what money they had left in return. Soon enough the Chechen fighters start assaulting the camp, and Captain Medvedev suggests that they escape via the river by raft. After travelling part of the distance that way, the five then carry the immobile captain to a Chechen Tower and hold off the siege before the called in  Mi-24 and Mi-8 flight of helicopter gunships relieve and rescue the group. Back at the airbase Ivan gets all of the ¬£35 thousand he was promised, hands some to Ruslan, and his narrative picks up again, that John having shot the documentary became very famous. Whilst Ivan received charges of murder of citizens of the Russian Federation, as he was already discharged from military, John walked off free. He never visited Russia since and gave his witness statement in England. However, the proud Ruslan Shamayev came to Moscow and expressed how he was savagely beaten by Ivan, who cynically killed Chechen women and children; he now lives in Moscow, and his son is a student at Moscow State University. Margaret, following the experience and her obvious love for the Captain, never married John, and the money that Ivan shared with the Captain was returned to her. So, instead, Ivan sent all he had left to the Captain's family, which allowed them to finance several expensive operations. Only the Captain supports Ivan's statement, and once again Ivan repeats his respect for the man. At that, everything fits in, as Ivan's interview was in a prison interrogation chamber; he himself thinks he will not be convicted, though anything can happen."

General Liu Yongfu of the Black Flag Army approaches Wong Fei-hung and requests that the latter help him muster and train a militia to assist in defending the town. Among those recruited by Wong are the butcher Porky Wing and an American-educated Chinese called Bucktooth So. Wong meets Siu-kwan, who is around the same age as him, and whom he addresses respectfully as ""13th Aunt"". Although they are not direct blood relations, her father was a sworn brother of Wong's grandfather so she is considered to be Wong's elder. They develop romantic feelings for each other but their relationship is often restrained as it is considered taboo in traditional culture. Leung Foon arrives in town with an opera troupe to stage performances. He runs into some trouble with the Shaho Gang, which terrorises local businesses by demanding ""protection money"" from them. He accidentally runs into 13th Aunt and falls in love with her. After being fired from the team, Leung meets a martial artist called ""Iron Vest"" Yim and becomes the latter's student. Yim wants to make his name and establish a martial arts school in Foshan, but he knows that he must first defeat Wong, the best fighter in town. Meanwhile, the Shaho Gang sets fire to Wong's clinic Po-chi-lam as a warning after Wong interfered when they caused trouble in town. The gangsters later seek shelter under the Americans from the Sino-Pacific Company after the governor issued orders for their arrests. In return for protection from the authorities, the thugs aid foreigners in human trafficking by kidnapping local women to be sold to distant lands as prostitutes. The Shaho Gang's boss meets Yim and agrees to help him if the latter allies with his gang and the Americans. The Shaho Gang abduct 13th Aunt while she is assisting an escaped labourer from America to avoid the local government's inspection. Wong and his followers are thrown into prison for fighting with soldiers sent by the authorities while buying time for 13th Aunt and the labourer to flee. The guards release Wong and his companions out of respect for them. Just then, Bucktooth So reports to Wong that 13th Aunt has been captured by the Shaho Gang. Wong and his men disguise themselves and infiltrate the Americans' base and defeat the foreigners and gangsters after a battle. Wong faces Yim in a man-on-man fight and overcomes the latter. Yim is killed by gunfire from the Americans, who were actually targeting Wong. Wong and his companions eventually succeed in rescuing 13th Aunt and the kidnapped women, and Wong kills the American leader Jackson by hurling an unused bullet into the latter's forehead with his fingers. At the end of the film, Leung Foon is seen being accepted by Wong as a student."

This time, their opponents include German and British forces, as well as the xenophobic feminist Red Lantern Society. During a parade, the Red Lantern Society attacks a German church. Before things get out of control, Wong comes to the foreigners' aid and he fights with the society's members, who are armed with rope weapons and ether-filled lanterns. As the champion of the Lion Dance Competition in the third film, Wong is invited by a Chinese general to join him in representing China in an international lion dance competition. The contest is actually a challenge posed by the Eight-Nation Alliance to China, and the Chinese need to win in order to defend their sovereignty and put on a display of national strength. Since the competition is an international one, contestants are not limited to using lion masks, hence other animal masks, such as dragon, centipede and eagle, are present. Wong is late for the competition as he was busy dealing with the Red Lantern Society, so the general's dragon dance teams started without him. The contest turned out to be a brutal massacre, as the foreigners' animal masks are equipped with various types of weapons and they are using ""dirty"" tricks to ensure victory. The general and several dancers are killed in the contest. When Wong finally arrives, he is shocked and issues a formal challenge to the foreigners, requesting for a rematch. This time, Wong's teams are better prepared and they emerge victorious. Ironically, after Wong's triumph, he receives news that the armies of the Eight-Nation Alliance have invaded and occupied Beijing, inflicting a crushing defeat on China. Wong has no choice but to leave Beijing with his companions and return to Foshan."

Wong comes into conflict with a corrupt police chief who is helping evil monks from a nearby temple to kidnap young women and sell them into prostitution in distant lands. Whilst investigating the temple, Wong gets into a fight and is subsequently accused of an unprovoked attack on the monks. He is also poisoned and becomes temporarily deaf. In a later fight, Wong intervenes in the police chief's attempts to assassinate a foreign official. In one scene, parodying traditional lion dances, Wong dresses up as a rooster, compete with an iron beak and claws. He clucks as he battles his enemies, who are shrouded in a giant metallic centipede. This scene has its roots in the 1956 film Huang Fei-hong tie ji dou wu gong , which starred Kwan Tak-hing as Wong Fei-hung. In the final fight against the police chief, Wong uses drunken boxing after his toes are broken while attempting to execute a Shadowless Kick on his opponent. The film concludes with Wong and his companions marching away victorious, but not before Wong rebukes the foreign official for selling opium and causing young children to go deaf.

He detests dogs and children. Although he also disagrees with many values of women, Peter is a commitment-phobe as he much prefers women who come and go very briefly in his life. At the office of his eye surgeon, Peter bumps into a leggy eye-catching brunette named Theresa 'Terri' Kozlenko . He likes her very much but he doesn't immediately realise that she is a single mother to three children with a scowling dog until she invites him back to her flat. They build up a close relationship that shows they are a perfect match as Terri becomes the only woman prepared to put up with Peter's strong views day-by-day. Their relationship soon becomes more passionate . When she rejects his idea of living a life of purely sleeping together only at his bachelor pad , he reluctantly proposes to her and eventually moves in with her at her flat. They get married but then her rogue ex-husband Stephen Kozlenko  appears on the scene to spend more time with their children. Stephen and Peter clash at first but they soon become good drinking friends, much to the disapproval of Terri.

A serious operation to possibly cure Peter's problem arises, in which he tries to keep a secret from Terri so as to not worry her but a very upset Howard gets hysterical and therefore ruins Peter's attempts to make up a story about working away from home on a book.

Vass meets major obstacles at every turn during the film. First, word leaks out to the Argentine media that Vass is finally making his film and he has to dodge them as he executes his preproduction plans. The big problem is finding the perfect actor to portray the king. When all of the professional auditions are rejected, Vass turns to the street. Unfortunately, he chooses a hippie type, who mistakes Vass for the cops and flees. Still, Vass catches up and convinces him to play the part. Finally, Vass assembles cast and crew and prepares to go southern Argentina to shoot the film. However, his financial backer withdraws with the film's money and flees abroad. Now Vass has no money to pay his staff. The actors immediately abandon the project and once again Vass hits the streets to find his actors. Finally, the group makes it to the location for shooting. By this time they are so broke that they cannot afford lodging and end up staying at an orphanage until an actor makes the wrong advances towards a youngster and gets them kicked out. The crew, not wanting to sleep in tents, decide to leave. The cast joins them. Despite this final crushing blow, Vass will not abandon the film and portrays the king himself, using mannequins for extras to create some of the films most haunting and surreal scenes.

The White boys disguise their narcotics trafficking behind rows of expensive luxury sports cars, executive level jobs, and flashy designer suits. Led by the vicious but urbane Victor Manning, the White Boys operate above accusation but not suspicion. Law enforcement knows they are dirty, but they cannot prove it. Caine is determined to bring them down. Caine‚Äôs superior is tired of his unusual and improper tactics. Meanwhile, Caine's girlfriend, coroner Diane Pallone , wants him to make a stronger commitment to their relationship. When the White Boys steal a shipment of heroin from a federal evidence warehouse, they hide evidence of their involvement by blowing up the facility, killing or injuring numerous people. This brings in the FBI, which becomes involved in Caine's vendetta against the White Boys. Caine is partnered with a by-the-book partner, FBI agent Arwood ""Larry"" Smith . They investigate the drug theft and murder of several key White Boys soldiers. Smith wants Caine to follow official procedure, but Caine ignores him. He disregards Smith's interference and begins to suspect that the Feds are investigating more than just the White Boys. Caine‚Äôs instincts are proven right. The first clue is the murder weapon in the White Boys‚Äô massacre: a hyper-fast, super-sharp vibrating disk like nothing they have ever seen. The second is a series of drug-related deaths has everyone very puzzled. The corpses are full of heroin, but the cause of death is not drug overdose. Caine and Smith do not follow the manual in their pursuit of answers. They end up on the trail of Talec , a vicious extraterrestrial drug dealer. Talec shoots his victims full of drugs and then uses alien technology to extract endorphins from their brains, synthesizing them into a substance to be used by addicts on his home planet. He is pursued by an alien cop named Azeck , who warns Caine and Smith that if Talec is not stopped, thousands of intergalactic drug dealers will start to come to Earth to slaughter its population. Putting aside their differences, Smith and Caine team up to take Talec down."

Her path is strewn with a number of conquests, including an enamored highwayman, a lord and some others who hang on her every word. A highwayman stops her coach as she is on her way to Bath and is immediately raptured by Kitty Bellairs. He trades the loot from the passengers for a kiss from Kitty who feels she should ""yield"" in order to protect Lord Varney's life who has gallantly come to defend her honor. In spite of this, Lord Varney draws his sword and ends up losing the fight when he loses his sword, upon which the highwayman declares, ""Blood is not a pretty sight for tender eyes, Retrieve your sword while I go about my business."" He proceeds to kiss Kitty who declares she considers herself not to have been kissed at all, upon which the highwayman kisses her several times and slips a ring on her finger leaving her enraptured. Lord Varney, however, is in love with Kitty himself but is extremely bashful and shy. The film then progresses to the city of Bath, where the inhabitants sing an amusing song about their daily lives, and the proceeds to a dance which Kitty is attending. She meets Captain O'Hara  who declares his love for her. When Lord Varney approaches and asks for his dance from Kitty, Captain O'Hara declares that ""it 'was' his dance"" and whisks her away. Lord Varney is approached by his friend who laughs at his shyness. Nevertheless, Lord Varney declares his love for her and decides to write a love poem to Kitty. The film then proceeds to the next day and we see Kitty being tended to by her maid while chatting with her hairdresser about her three lovers. She describes them and asks his opinion on whom she should choose. The film then proceeds to the house of Lady Julia Standish  on whom Kitty is paying a call. Lady Julia's husband is neglecting her and Kitty gives her advice on how to many her husband interested once again. Her husband, Sir Jasper Standish  arrives from a trip to find her dressed elegantly as if expecting a caller. Meanwhile, Kitty places a love note addressed to her in a conspicuous place with a lock of red hair and leaves the house. Through a welter of songs into which the principals break at short intervals she at length decides on a lord instead of a highwayman. Lord Varney, hearing that Kitty was visiting Lady Standish, comes to call on Kitty at Lord Standish's house. Lord Standish immediately assumes that he is fooling around with his wife and insults his so that he must fight a duel ""according to the code"" in order to uphold his honor. The report of the scandal soon flies through the town and we are taken to a bath where everyone is talking about the supposed affair. Kitty happens to be there and as soon as she hears the story she begins to fear for the life of Lord Varney, whom she now realizes is the one she really loves. Through a welter of songs into which the principals break at short intervals, as well as outrageous Pre-Code comedy, satire and drama, Kitty and Lord Varney are at length united."

Focusing on one squad of D.E.B.S., composed of the team captain Amy , the tough Max , French exchange student Dominique , and the prissy and insecure Janet , all of whom faces off against a ruthless villain named Lucy in the Sky . Spoofing TV prime time shows, a listing of ""previous on D.E.B.S."" shows the team's boss Mr. Tibbs explaining that Lucy in the Sky was spotted entering the United States again. Max is frustrated knowing that for some reason Lucy keeps capturing Amy and the team has to rescue her. Amy is captured, leading to Max to take over the team to lead them to Lucy's hideout in a dockside warehouse. Max, Janet, and the chain-smoking Dominique make entry into Lucy's hideout and soon are facing off in a gun battle with Lucy's henchmen, led by her right-hand man Billy Skids. Meanwhile, unknown to either Lucy's henchmen or the D.E.B.S., Lucy and Amy are lovers and Lucy keeps capturing Amy so that the two of them can have sex, with Amy timing them to know when her colleagues will appear to ""rescue"" her.

Elsewhere, Max, Janet, and Dominique defeat Lucy's henchmen . The three D.E.B.S. arrive at a locked door to Lucy's quarters where they hear Amy screaming out, leading them to try to break down the door.

At the silver jubilee of the mill that his father, the late Sanjiv Lal opened 25 years ago, he announces a prize reward of 5 lakh rupees for all the workers, annoying his mother. A servant at the house, Karuna , suggests marrying him off to stop his immature antics, to which Rani Maa agrees. Her manager, Shyamlal, arranges for her to meet some girls, as she insists that Rajiv will marry a girl of her choice. Rajiv returns home and sees all the girls - he correctly surmises that his mother is getting him married, and he pretends to be a mute who walks with a limp in order to chase all the prospective suitors off. His plan succeeds, although he is in a dilemma - what should he do now? His mother is furious at him. One of his friends suggests that he should run away to their bungalow in Kashmir - after all, Rani Maa never goes there. Upon arrival, he finds that his estate manager, Bholaram , has made a hotel out of their bungalow and has even rented out some rooms for the season. He tells the tenants that he is Rajiv Lal, although when he meets Bholaram, the latter informs him that Rani Maa had called him, and told him not to let Rajiv stay at the bungalow, should he come. Rajiv manages to convince Bholaram to tell Rani Maa that he is not there. Bholaram tells the tenants in the house that Rajiv is in fact mad, and in his madness, thinks that he is the real owner of the estate. The next day, Rajiv meets Champa , a girl who sells flowers for a living. He buys her flowers for 20 rupees when they are priced at 5 for the whole basket, and tells her that he is not the owner, but the driver. Soon enough, after a few misadventures, they fall in love and decide to marry, but there are a few obstacles. First of all, Mohan , the forest manager, has loaned out some money to Champa's father, Dinu , and he insists that he will marry Champa if Dinu cannot repay the debt. Things become complicated when Mohan finds out that Dinu is not Champa's real father, and he blackmails Dinu into getting Champa married to him, or else he will let out the secret to Champa. Champa still continues to meet Rajiv on the sly, but all of that comes to an end when the three girls, who are tenants in his house, reveal in her presence that he is not the driver, but the owner of the estate himself! Feeling betrayed, Champa runs off. Before Rajiv can go after her, he receives a trunk call from his mother, and he is informed that Karuna is seriously ill. After telling Bholaram to explain everything to Champa, he leaves for Bombay, and finds Karuna on her deathbed, Rani Maa at her side. Karuna tells Rajiv that he is not the real son of Rani Maa - his biological father is none other than her brother, Dinu! Many years ago, Dinu had sold him off to Karuna for money for alcohol, and Rani Maa had taken him in. Soon after, Rani Maa gave birth to a baby girl, but Dinu abducts her, intending to kill her, so that Rajiv will be the sole heir to Rani Maa's wealth. However, on the way, Dinu trips and falls, and he ends up blind, so he does not kill the girl. Rajiv is shocked at the revelation, but more so is Rani Maa, who had assumed that her baby girl was dead. Before Karuna can say who the girl is, she dies. Shyamlal informs the two that the day Karuna fell ill, a man from Kashmir had come to see her and asked about Rani Maa's girl, but Karuna hadn't told him anything. The man turns out to be Mohan. Rajiv and Rani Maa head back to Kashmir to find out who her girl is, and Rajiv, acting on a tip from Bholaram, goes to confront Mohan. He beats Mohan unconscious, and Mohan's friend tells Rajiv who the girl is - Champa. He goes to find her, and finds out that she is getting married to Mohan in a few days. Dinu returns home as well, and Champa questions him. He lies to her at first, but when Rajiv drops a hint that he is the son that Dinu had sold all those years ago, the latter hugs him and admits that Champa is not his daughter. Rani Maa comes in and finds Champa, and the two embrace, but the happy moment doesn't last for long. Mohan arrives with his goons and decides to forcibly get married to Champa. Dinu tries to stop him, but Mohan beats him up badly. The goons also tie Rajiv up, and then take Rani Maa and Champa to wedding altar forcibly. Back at Rajiv's bungalow, Chander , Rajiv's friend, and Shyamlal decide to go after them and see why they are taking so long. Rajiv manages to escape from his captors, but Dinu is still unconscious. He meets with Chander and Shyamlal on the way, and tells them to get the police while he goes after Mohan. He breaks into Mohan's hideout and stops the wedding ceremony.

Beauty in trouble flees to the good angel On whom she can rely To pay her cab-fare, run a steaming bath, Poultice her bruised eye; Will not at first, whether for shame or caution, Her difficulty disclose; Until he draws a cheque book from his plumage, Asking her how much she owes;  Loves him less only than her saint-like mother, Promises to repay His loans and most seraphic thoughtfulness A million-fold one day. Beauty grows plump, renews her broken courage And, borrowing ink and pen, Writes a news-letter to the evil angel  The fiend who beats, betrays and sponges on her, Persuades her white is black, Flaunts vespertilian wing and cloven hoof; And soon will fetch her back. Virtue, good angel, is its own reward: Your dollars were well spent. But would you to the marriage of true minds Admit impediment? Robert Graves The Plot: The film is a naturalistic love story about the sex life of a beautiful woman, Marcela, and her concurrent relationships with three men; Jarda, her abusive husband, Risha, her abusive step-father, and Evzen, a dashing, older man she meets shortly after the film begins. With her husband, Jarda, she enjoys lustful sex and his physical abusiveness is an extension of a chauvinism that powers strong sexual encounters, but he is vain and not particularly bright about this. Richard, her mother's husband is unwittingly cruel, like an obnoxious and malicious child. He is played like one of Steve Martins ""wild and crazy guys"" but more repulsively. Ev≈æen, who becomes Marcela's benefactor/meal ticket, is a man of sophisticated tastes and fortunate parentage, a Czech who has inherited vineyards in Tuscany, to which home he takes Marcela and her two children. At the beginning of the story, Marcela, Jarda and their children are living in Prague above the garage where Jarda operates his chop shop. She isn't happy with this situation. Jarda couldn't care less how she feels about their situation and is even less interested in the health of their son, who is suffering because of their living conditions. By chance, Jarda's associate steals Ev≈æen‚Äôs car, which is equipped with a satellite tracking device and when Jarda goes to prison, Marcela takes her children to her mother's apartment, where they are met with Risha's venomous attention. Marcela despises her mother‚Äôs lecherous boyfriend and it eventually comes out that Risha fathered her first child and she escaped into marriage with Jarda at the age of seventeen. Ev≈æen and Marcela meet at the police station, when they both came to deal with the fate of Jarda. Taken by her, although she doesn't encourage it, Evzen offers to help her and eventually, her children move into Jarda's empty manse in Prague when life with Risha becomes unbearable. Marcela gives herself to Evzen and they move to Italy but when Marcela‚Äôs mother dies, she and the children come back to Prague to the funeral where she sees Jarda, now released from prison. She and Jarda have one of their typical sexual encounters and when he speaks to her as he did during their marriage she pushes him away and leaves. Jarda's character is patently chauvinistic, which turns her on but insults her afterwards. When they return to Italy, ironically, Evjzen invites Risha to come with them to live in their guest house."

Instead of being famous for her own amazing vocal talent, Han-na hides behind Amy's performance stage and sings during Amy's concerts, and records all of Amy's songs. One day, Amy ungratefully humiliates her in front of the music company's director Sang-jun during his birthday party, knowing full well that Han-na has a crush on him. While crying in the bathroom, Han-na overhears Sang-jun telling Amy that even though they are just using Han-na for her voice, they must be kind to her so she will not walk out on them. Heartbroken, Han-na attempts suicide but is interrupted by a phone call from one of her phone sex regulars who happens to be a top plastic surgeon. She decides to get head-to-toe plastic surgery instead. The surgeon at first refuses to operate on Han-na, but Han-na threatens to blackmail the surgeon by telling his wife about his calls. Then, Han-na makes a moving speech that she does not want to undergo surgery merely to be beautiful, but for the sake of love and as a boost in confidence so that she can live a life, and the surgeon is deeply moved. Han-na puts herself in seclusion for a year as she recovers from the changes. When she comes back from the hospital, Han-na is incredibly beautiful and slender. Not even her best friend Jung-min recognizes her. With Jung-min's help, she creates a new identity for herself; she is now a Korean-American from California named Jenny. After auditioning to be Amy's secret vocalist again, she earns her own recording contract instead from Sang-jun, claiming that she is ""all-natural"". In the meantime, Amy, oblivious just like everyone else of Han-na's new identity, desperately tries to find Han-na so that she can record her own postponed album  by spending time with Han-na's father who is in a hospital due to mental problems, possibly Alzheimer's. Meanwhile, romance begins to blossom between Jenny and Sang-jun, as he continues to promote Jenny, in effect boosting Han-na's confidence in her new self. However, Amy, through spending time with Han-na's father and Jenny, eventually realizes that this Jenny is actually Han-na in disguise. During a date one night, Jenny refuses Sang-jun's advances, as the surgeon mentions that if he touches her breasts, he will immediately know they are fake. She instead offers a phone sex session. After Jenny has fallen asleep, he sees the African character Jenny had drawn on the glass and realizes that he had seen it before; Han-na had drawn exactly the same signs on a sheet of music. He then realizes as well that Jenny is actually Han-nam but he keeps this information to himself. Jenny's debut single ""Maria"" becomes a hit and the recording company holds a party to celebrate its release. On the day of the party however, Amy brings Han-na's father in an attempt to blow her cover. Han-na's father tries to return Han-na's Barbie doll to her, which had always been Han-na's favorite childhood gift from him. Startled by the sudden appearance of her father and not knowing how to react in front of all the people, including Sang-jun, Han-na denies knowing her father and calls him a fan instead when Sang-jun asks her if the old man is her guest. As her father keeps insisting on giving her the doll, Sang-jun drags him away from Jenny knocks him down onto the floor. Desperate to keep her true identity a secret, Han-na makes no move to help her father. It is Jung-min who finally helps him up, casts Jenny a furious look and leads Han-na's father away from the party. After the party, Sang-jun and Jenny are the only ones left in the room. Sang-jun reveals to Jenny that he knows her true identity but is now cold and distant. He seems unable to forgive her for lying to him but says that he will still work to promote Jenny and carry on with her concert scheduled the next day. Han-na breaks down at this point, heartbroken and unable to pretend to be someone else anymore. She tears down the posters and smashes her CDs that are placed on a table, cutting her fingers in the process. Han-na tells him that it is incredibly frustrating and painful not being able to just be herself but have to live a lie, especially in front of him. The surgery that took a whole year to recover from was not nearly as painful as realizing that she still could not be close to Sang-jun. As Sang-jun tries to comfort her, she brushes away his efforts saying, ""You broke my heart. Tissue paper cannot fix it."" Sang-jun still insists on continuing with Jenny's first concert, despite protests from the company boss. Later, he encourages a distraught Jenny to do this concert, not for the sake of the fans or the company but for herself, thus implying that he has forgiven her and will continue to support her. At the concert, Jenny can't sing and later breaks down from the pressure of seeing her father being dragged away by security and tells everybody to stop. She then reveals to the public that Jenny is a ""fake,"" and that she is not ""all-natural"", as she had claimed. She proceeds tearfully to tell the large crowd her story: how she has abandoned everything that is dear to her - her best friend and father - to get to where she is. She also tells the crowd about how on the way to fame and fortune she has also lost her own identity and that she now no longer knows who she is. Sang-jun plays a tape of the old, obese Han-na, singing. Han-na turns around and sees her old image on the screen and tells the crowd that the image is the real her. The crowd, moved by her sincere confession, responds by chanting ""It's okay,"" and Han-na rekindles her relationships with her father and best friend. She drops the stage name Jenny and re-releases a CD with her own name, Han-na, and becomes a highly successful music artist, gaining many fans and anti-fans along the way. Sang-jun realizes the very thing about Han-na that had always drawn him to her was Han-na's innocence. At the end of the film, Jung-min also asks to get a head-to-toe plastic surgery."

His daughter Mary calls him from her bed; the girl has a fever and this forces Evaristo back. The tram that the three workers missed falls into the river and almost all the passengers die. For this and other episodes, Mary earns the reputation that she can predict the future. By 1940, Mary is now a very happy but very chaste young woman. One afternoon, in a bus, she sees a young man who smiles at her. When she gets off the bus, the man follows her to find out where she lives. That night Mary tells her father Evaristo that she had already chosen a husband, but does not know his name or where he lives. Rosita, a friend of Mary, announces her sudden wedding. During the wedding party, Tito, a pharmacist friend, reveals to Mary that Rosita is marrying because she is pregnant and an abortion was too dangerous. At hearing the word ""abortion,"" Mary feels revolted, gets dizzy, and flees the party. Mary becomes hysterical. ""They're all whores ... it's all shit,"" he shouts to Tito. That summer, Mary is reunited with the man from the bus, Cholo, who works for a meat packing company with his brothers and is also a boxer. Mary invites him to her house and they quickly start a relationship. At New Year's Eve, Mary meets Cholo's family: Cholo's mother  Mrs. America, Cholo's brother Raul and Raul's wife Sofia, Cholo's brother Hector and his wife Luisa, and Cholo's sister Claudia and her husband Ariel. At Mary's request, Cholo leaves boxing behind. Cholo and Mary make out passionately. Cholo tries to consummate the relationship, but Mary says she will marry a virgin, and when Cholo attempts to force himself on her, she rejects him. Five days later they reconcile and soon they plan their wedding. On the day of the civil wedding Mary announces that she will remain a virgin until the church wedding, to be held two days later. Again Cholo tries to force Mary, but she rejects him very violently. After the church wedding, Cholo and Mary have a passionate wedding night in a hotel in Buenos Aires and consummate their relationship. Sofia, sister in law of Cholo announces worriedly that she is pregnant. The previous delivery had complications, and Sofia fears what will happen if she decides to continue with the pregnancy. Mary says that ‚Äúit is better to sacrifice one's life rather than to kill a child ... it is very dangerous to play with fate."" Sofia decides to have an abortion, but she dies as a result of the intervention. When Mary finds out, she feels revolted and repeats: ‚ÄúThey're all shit.‚Äù After the funeral, Mary declares that Sofia deserved what happened to her, but then she decides to help raise Sofia‚Äôs children and respect her memory. Cholo‚Äôs sister Claudia said Mary prophesied the death of Sophia, but Mary says she only gave Sofia some advice. Six months after becoming a widower, Cholo's brother Raul begins a relationship with a widow. Mary finds out and accuses Raul of desecrating Sofia's memory. Ariel, Claudia's husband and Cholo's brother-in-law, defends Raul's courtship. Mary says to Ariel: ""I wonder what you would think if you were to die and Claudia were to find someone else."" Claudia, who believes that Mary is a prophetess, tells her to shut up. Mary begins to move away from Cholo and asks Cholo to leave the business he has with his brothers. Mary becomes increasingly sad and sullen. Cholo gets a day off. On the day that Ariel takes Cholo's place at work, an accident occurs with the delivery truck and Ariel dies. When Mary attends the wake, Claudia tells her to leave and they stop talking to each other. Mary's ""prophecies"" continues to be fulfilled: After Ariel dies, Claudia finds a boyfriend and plans to remarry. Mary gets more depressed, retreats from Cholo's family and begins to wear black. Only Cholo's sister Luisa still visits Mary, but Mary prophecies Luisa's, and her own, death. Thus Mary imagines the progressive death of all of Mrs. America's children-in-law. Mary's rejection of her in-laws affects her relationship with Cholo. Mary has nightmares, suffers depression and isolates herself from the world. When Luisa gets sick with food poisoning, Mary finally looses her mind. He says it is fate that Luisa, and then herself, die. Luisa recovers, but Mary is asleep when Cholo returns with the good news. When Cholo is asleep, Mary gets up, strips herself naked, puts on her wedding dress, and takes a knife. Mary goes to the bedroom and kills Cholo by stabbing him in the heart."

His daughter Mary calls him from her bed; the girl has a fever and this forces Evaristo back. The tram that the three workers missed falls into the river and almost all the passengers die. For this and other episodes, Mary earns the reputation that she can predict the future. By 1940, Mary is now a very happy but very chaste young woman. One afternoon, in a bus, she sees a young man who smiles at her. When she gets off the bus, the man follows her to find out where she lives. That night Mary tells her father Evaristo that she had already chosen a husband, but does not know his name or where he lives. Rosita, a friend of Mary, announces her sudden wedding. During the wedding party, Tito, a pharmacist friend, reveals to Mary that Rosita is marrying because she is pregnant and an abortion was too dangerous. At hearing the word ""abortion,"" Mary feels revolted, gets dizzy, and flees the party. Mary becomes hysterical. ""They're all whores ... it's all shit,"" he shouts to Tito. That summer, Mary is reunited with the man from the bus, Cholo, who works for a meat packing company with his brothers and is also a boxer.

Again Cholo tries to force Mary, but she rejects him very violently. After the church wedding, Cholo and Mary have a passionate wedding night in a hotel in Buenos Aires and consummate their relationship. Sofia, sister in law of Cholo announces worriedly that she is pregnant. The previous delivery had complications, and Sofia fears what will happen if she decides to continue with the pregnancy. Mary says that ‚Äúit is better to sacrifice one's life rather than to kill a child ... it is very dangerous to play with fate."" Sofia decides to have an abortion, but she dies as a result of the intervention. When Mary finds out, she feels revolted and repeats: ‚ÄúThey're all shit.‚Äù After the funeral, Mary declares that Sofia deserved what happened to her, but then she decides to help raise Sofia‚Äôs children and respect her memory. Cholo‚Äôs sister Claudia said Mary prophesied the death of Sophia, but Mary says she only gave Sofia some advice. Six months after becoming a widower, Cholo's brother Raul begins a relationship with a widow. Mary finds out and accuses Raul of desecrating Sofia's memory. Ariel, Claudia's husband and Cholo's brother-in-law, defends Raul's courtship. Mary says to Ariel: ""I wonder what you would think if you were to die and Claudia were to find someone else."" Claudia, who believes that Mary is a prophetess, tells her to shut up. Mary begins to move away from Cholo and asks Cholo to leave the business he has with his brothers.

Only Cholo's sister Luisa still visits Mary, but Mary prophecies Luisa's, and her own, death. Thus Mary imagines the progressive death of all of Mrs. America's children-in-law.

When Luisa gets sick with food poisoning, Mary finally looses her mind. He says it is fate that Luisa, and then herself, die. Luisa recovers, but Mary is asleep when Cholo returns with the good news. When Cholo is asleep, Mary gets up, strips herself naked, puts on her wedding dress, and takes a knife. Mary goes to the bedroom and kills Cholo by stabbing him in the heart."

When driving on the Stuart Highway late one night, they are flagged down by a bearded man driving a ute.

Lees cries out for Falconio, but he does not answer back, and he is not seen again after this point. The bearded man then appears at the front of the vehicle brandishing a gun, and attempts to kidnap Lees, tying her up in the process.

The story is told from the viewpoint of Nicolas, a young boy. By mistake the mother of the family is killed by right-wing extremists because they believe she had photographed a civilian protest march and the violent suppression by a military patrol in Buenos Aires. In fact, her twin sister actually took the pictures. She recognized its leader as the father of her nephew and she shows the pictures to her sister. One day while the sister is out, the man shows up with his political thugs and murders the mother and then hunts for Nicolas who hides inside a large grandfather clock. Nicolas  is soon taken by his aunt to her home in the country, where he attends the local Catholic school, where most of the children's parents are in the military. At the school the fascist bullies and kids who are frightened by them offer a parallel to Argentina's political situation at the time. The boys imitate their parents with dirty tricks toward a boy they call a mixto  who they regularly beat and torment. Nicolas develops a friendship with the mixto and confides in him about what happened to his mother. A few years later, after the mixto has been taken away, Nicolas and the other bullies take part in the Malvinas/Falklands War. Afterward, Nicolas settles an old, old score.

At the same time a colleague claims to have been contacting Mars by radio, first through an exchange of mathematical concepts and then through answers to specific questions. The transmissions claim that Mars is a utopia. This revelation leads to political and economic chaos, especially in the Western hemisphere. The U.S. government imposes a news blackout after the first four messages, only to reveal much later that Earth's people can be saved if they return to the worship of God. Revolution sweeps the globe, including the Soviet Union. But doubts about the authenticity of the messages remain. An ex-Nazi who developed the original communication device prototype wants to announce that he has been duping the Americans with false messages from a secret Soviet-funded radio transmitter high in the Andes mountains of South America. The mystery thickens as it appears the messages may have continued even after the secret transmitter was destroyed in an avalanche.

In the original story, maintained in the 1949 film and the 1996 TV remake, is that Samson only regains his strength after his hair has grown long again, thus allowing him to tear down the Philistine temple. Here, however, Samson is taken to the Philistine temple just after his hair has been cut short, and he prays to God to restore his immense strength despite his short hair, and God complies, allowing Samson enough strength to tear down the stone pillars, thus destroying the temple. Unlike the 1949 and 1996 adaptations, Delilah survives to mourn Samson alongside his followers.

After Gus's latest escapade is cleaned up and paid for, Dave orders his long-suffering secretary, Ivy Tolliver, to find a new nurse for Gus, then leaves on a business trip. Upon his return, Dave learns that Ivy has placed Gus in the Playtime School, and that he must meet with the teacher, Lydia Marble, to enroll Gus formally. Rushed as usual, Dave tells the attractive Lydia that he will pay whatever it takes to keep Gus in line, but when Lydia explains that parents are required to participate in their child's education at Playtime, Dave indignantly states that he knows all he needs to about Gus. Dave is amazed by how well Gus responds to Lydia's instructions, however, after he smacks a schoolmate. Believing that Gus can benefit from Lydia's tutelage, Dave agrees to keep him at Playtime. As the next three weeks pass, Gus becomes contented and well-behaved, but on Dave's scheduled parent participation day, the businessman instead sends a truckload of toys to the school. Lydia returns the toys with a note admonishing Dave that as a substitute for his attention, the toys are not enough, and when Dave comes to the school to protest, Lydia assumes that he is there to help. After a wearying day, Dave is angered by Lydia's amused response to his exhaustion, and he storms out, telling Gus that they will find a school that does not specialize in ""making jerks out of fathers."" Lydia visits his apartment that evening to explain that she was laughing merely because Dave was so much like the other bewildered new parents.

After the meeting, Lydia mentions that Dave should get a beach house so that Gus can have more room, and asks about his wife. Dave angrily replies that his wife walked out on him and took all of his money when his business was suffering, and that he had to rebuild completely. Later that evening, Dave tells Lydia that he has fallen in love with her, and although Lydia returns Dave's affections, she tells him that his feelings stem from his dependence upon her for help with Gus. That night, Dave comforts a frightened Gus by allowing him to sleep in his bed, and, realizing that he no longer needs Lydia for instruction on child care, confronts her with his new knowledge. Secure that Dave does indeed love her for herself, Lydia enjoys his embrace. As time passes, Dave becomes a devoted father, and his romance with Lydia blossoms into an engagement. On Gus's birthday, however, Joyce, Dave's ex-wife, appears and asks Dave to visit her at her hotel. Fearing the worst, Dave keeps the appointment and discovers that the money-grubbing, immoral Joyce is broke and claims that their Mexican divorce is not legal. Dave's lawyer, Farley Norris, confirms the upsetting news, but Dave, infuriated by Joyce's reappearance, refuses to give her money to obtain a legal divorce. Determined to win, no matter what is revealed about Joyce in court, Dave does not listen to the pleas of his friends that he think of Gus and end the confrontation quietly.

After Gus's latest escapade is cleaned up and paid for, Dave orders his long-suffering secretary, Ivy Tolliver, to find a new nurse for Gus, then leaves on a business trip. Upon his return, Dave learns that Ivy has placed Gus in the Playtime School, and that he must meet with the teacher, Lydia Marble, to enroll Gus formally. Rushed as usual, Dave tells the attractive Lydia that he will pay whatever it takes to keep Gus in line, but when Lydia explains that parents are required to participate in their child's education at Playtime, Dave indignantly states that he knows all he needs to about Gus. Dave is amazed by how well Gus responds to Lydia's instructions, however, after he smacks a schoolmate. Believing that Gus can benefit from Lydia's tutelage, Dave agrees to keep him at Playtime. As the next three weeks pass, Gus becomes contented and well-behaved, but on Dave's scheduled parent participation day, the businessman instead sends a truckload of toys to the school. Lydia returns the toys with a note admonishing Dave that as a substitute for his attention, the toys are not enough, and when Dave comes to the school to protest, Lydia assumes that he is there to help. After a wearying day, Dave is angered by Lydia's amused response to his exhaustion, and he storms out, telling Gus that they will find a school that does not specialize in ""making jerks out of fathers."" Lydia visits his apartment that evening to explain that she was laughing merely because Dave was so much like the other bewildered new parents. Dave relates that his childhood was full of hardship, then admits that he is baffled by how to be the ""top man"" with his son, as he is in business. Lydia assures him that if he works hard, he will be a successful parent, then promises that if he does not enjoy his next day at school, he does not have to come again. As she leaves, Lydia tells Gus that he will be returning to Playtime, where they try to ""make fathers out of jerks."" Soon after, Lydia sends Dave child-rearing books and arranges for the children to visit his candy factory. Dave is surprised by how much he enjoys playing tour guide for the youngsters, and that night, at a meeting of the Playtime parents, conducts an impromptu and well-received lecture on parenting. After the meeting, Lydia mentions that Dave should get a beach house so that Gus can have more room, and asks about his wife. Dave angrily replies that his wife walked out on him and took all of his money when his business was suffering, and that he had to rebuild completely. Later that evening, Dave tells Lydia that he has fallen in love with her, and although Lydia returns Dave's affections, she tells him that his feelings stem from his dependence upon her for help with Gus. That night, Dave comforts a frightened Gus by allowing him to sleep in his bed, and, realizing that he no longer needs Lydia for instruction on child care, confronts her with his new knowledge. Secure that Dave does indeed love her for herself, Lydia enjoys his embrace. As time passes, Dave becomes a devoted father, and his romance with Lydia blossoms into an engagement. On Gus's birthday, however, Joyce, Dave's ex-wife, appears and asks Dave to visit her at her hotel. Fearing the worst, Dave keeps the appointment and discovers that the money-grubbing, immoral Joyce is broke and claims that their Mexican divorce is not legal. Dave's lawyer, Farley Norris, confirms the upsetting news, but Dave, infuriated by Joyce's reappearance, refuses to give her money to obtain a legal divorce. Determined to win, no matter what is revealed about Joyce in court, Dave does not listen to the pleas of his friends that he think of Gus and end the confrontation quietly. Dave instead hires private detectives to gather ammunition against Joyce until the day before the trial begins. Needing a rest, Dave drives to his new beach house and spends the night. Unknown to Dave, Lydia and Gus have also spent the night there, and in court the next day, Joyce's lawyer charges Dave with adultery and names Lydia as the co-respondent. The resulting publicity horrifies Lydia, and she is forced to close her school. Lydia confronts Dave, accusing him of caring more about his fortune than about his son, and breaks their engagement. As the trial continues, Farley proves that Joyce abandoned Dave, and the judge upholds Dave's request for a divorce. Although he does not award Joyce any of Dave's property, the judge, sickened by Dave's tactics, grants Joyce custody of Gus. Dave is heartbroken, and on the morning that he drives Gus to Joyce's hotel, is overcome when Gus pleads to remain with him. Realizing that Gus is more important to him than anything else, Dave marches to Joyce's room and agrees to give her everything he owns in exchange for permanent custody of Gus. As he returns to the car, Dave is met by Lydia, who promises to help him fight for his son. Assuring her that the matter is settled, Dave embraces Lydia and Gus, then asks Lydia if she can pay for lunch."

Lydia assures him that if he works hard, he will be a successful parent, then promises that if he does not enjoy his next day at school, he does not have to come again. As she leaves, Lydia tells Gus that he will be returning to Playtime, where they try to ""make fathers out of jerks."" Soon after, Lydia sends Dave child-rearing books and arranges for the children to visit his candy factory. Dave is surprised by how much he enjoys playing tour guide for the youngsters, and that night, at a meeting of the Playtime parents, conducts an impromptu and well-received lecture on parenting. After the meeting, Lydia mentions that Dave should get a beach house so that Gus can have more room, and asks about his wife. Dave angrily replies that his wife walked out on him and took all of his money when his business was suffering, and that he had to rebuild completely. Later that evening, Dave tells Lydia that he has fallen in love with her, and although Lydia returns Dave's affections, she tells him that his feelings stem from his dependence upon her for help with Gus. That night, Dave comforts a frightened Gus by allowing him to sleep in his bed, and, realizing that he no longer needs Lydia for instruction on child care, confronts her with his new knowledge. Secure that Dave does indeed love her for herself, Lydia enjoys his embrace. As time passes, Dave becomes a devoted father, and his romance with Lydia blossoms into an engagement. On Gus's birthday, however, Joyce, Dave's ex-wife, appears and asks Dave to visit her at her hotel. Fearing the worst, Dave keeps the appointment and discovers that the money-grubbing, immoral Joyce is broke and claims that their Mexican divorce is not legal. Dave's lawyer, Farley Norris, confirms the upsetting news, but Dave, infuriated by Joyce's reappearance, refuses to give her money to obtain a legal divorce. Determined to win, no matter what is revealed about Joyce in court, Dave does not listen to the pleas of his friends that he think of Gus and end the confrontation quietly. Dave instead hires private detectives to gather ammunition against Joyce until the day before the trial begins. Needing a rest, Dave drives to his new beach house and spends the night. Unknown to Dave, Lydia and Gus have also spent the night there, and in court the next day, Joyce's lawyer charges Dave with adultery and names Lydia as the co-respondent. The resulting publicity horrifies Lydia, and she is forced to close her school. Lydia confronts Dave, accusing him of caring more about his fortune than about his son, and breaks their engagement. As the trial continues, Farley proves that Joyce abandoned Dave, and the judge upholds Dave's request for a divorce. Although he does not award Joyce any of Dave's property, the judge, sickened by Dave's tactics, grants Joyce custody of Gus. Dave is heartbroken, and on the morning that he drives Gus to Joyce's hotel, is overcome when Gus pleads to remain with him. Realizing that Gus is more important to him than anything else, Dave marches to Joyce's room and agrees to give her everything he owns in exchange for permanent custody of Gus. As he returns to the car, Dave is met by Lydia, who promises to help him fight for his son. Assuring her that the matter is settled, Dave embraces Lydia and Gus, then asks Lydia if she can pay for lunch."

Capt. Gates  explains to McHale that accurate weather forecasts are crucial to the Allies' success in the Pacific theater, and that his practical experience is required by meteorologist Commander Hobart Wyatt  and his crew of technicians: Jenkins ([[Don Taylor , Walter Landers , Wilbur ""Coney"" Cohen , Elwood Halsey , Frank Swenson  and Paul Sabatello . Despite his longing for the ocean, McHale adjusts to life in the desert during the following six months, although Wyatt is bemused by McHale's dependence on the military's strict chain of command. In July 1945, three weeks before they are to be relieved, the crew learns that Japanese cavalry is scouring the desert for the weather stations, and McHale starts work constructing defenses for the outpost. The group is also baffled by the arrival of a tribe of nomadic Mongols, who camp at the station's oasis. After determining that the Navy men are not interested in the oasis' grass, the Mongols' leader, Kengtu , expresses no further interest in them until Elwood attempts to take photographs of the tribe. The Mongols react with hostility, but McHale gains Kengtu's respect when he shows him how the camera works. Observing the Mongols' horsemanship, former cowboy Jenkins muses that they would make an excellent cavalry. The next day, Kengtu orders his people to return the many things they have stolen from the station, although McHale allows them to keep his own cap and Wyatt's dress uniform. Later that day, the Navy men learn that due to increasing pressure from the enemy, they will not be relieved. Hoping to persuade the Mongols to help them defend the station, McHale requisitions sixty saddles, and although the order is met with bewilderment, the saddles soon arrive and the delighted Mongols begin training with Commander Wyatt, who dubs them the ""1st Mongolian Cavalry, U.S. Navy."" Before long, however, the camp is bombed by Japanese planes. Wyatt and several Mongols are killed. The radio is also destroyed, and McHale is disappointed when the Mongols disappear, leaving them alone and defenseless. Rather than walking 300 miles to the nearest weather station, which might also have been attacked, McHale decides that the team travel 800 miles to the sea. The men are skeptical, but McHale orders the evacuation in his authority as commander of the team. Hoping to reach north China, and from there sail to Okinawa, captured by US forces, McHale drives the team onward, and they stop at an oasis at which some Chinese traders are camped. Also at the oasis are Kengtu and his people, and McHale confronts the chief for failing to help the navy as promised. Kengtu replies that he had to protect his people from the ""birds in the sky,"" and agrees to put the question of helping the Americans to his people. The next day Kengtu returns the saddles. Chinese trader Yin Tang  then barters for the saddle, offering McHale four camels, and suggests that the Americans travel with the Chinese. That night, however, the treacherous Yin Tang attempts to kill them, to steal back the camels, but is stopped by the arrival of Kengtu and his men. Kengtu tells McHale that his people want the saddles back and are willing to escort the Americans to China, provided that they dress in native garb to deceive the Japanese. McHale agrees, although the men worry that they will be considered spies if they are captured because they will be out of uniform. Kengtu's plan appears to be working, however, until they reach the Chinese village of Sangchien, which is a garrison for the Japanese. Power-hungry Mongol Tomec , fed up with the troublesome Americans, appears to persuade Kengtu to turn them in, and later, McHale is angry when Kengtu leads them into an ambush by Japanese soldiers. The Navy men are taken to a prisoner-of-war camp on the coast. Questioned by a Japanese officer , McHale refuses to divulge any information about the remaining weather stations. Angered, the officer holds the men as spies rather than POWs, which means they will be shot. Their depression is lifted, however, when one of Kengtu's men, Wali-Akhun ([[Leonard Strong , allows himself to be arrested while wearing Wyatt's stolen uniform. Wali reveals that Kengtu has arranged for their escape, and that night, they break out of the camp and to the docks, where Kengtu is waiting with a Chinese junk. Kengtu explains to McHale that he did not betray them, but rather tricked the Japanese soldiers into transporting them to the ocean. Coney is killed during the escape, however, and the novice sailors soberly set sail for Okinawa. Eleven days later, the junk is spotted by American planes, which are about to bomb it until they see a large sign, with the inscription ""U.S.S. Cohen"" painted on it. The men are rescued, and soon after, Kengtu is returned to his people, along with sixty saddle blankets. Kengtu and McHale say farewell, and when McHale tries to explain that he is not the head chief of the Navy, as Kengtu had mistakenly thought, Kengtu replies that it is the Navy's mistake, not his."

Holmes  has just restored a stolen artifact to three French nuns, and is later called on a case by Dr. Mortimer  concerning Sir Henry Baskerville  and a legendary hound that curses the Baskerville estate. Tired and worn out by so many cases, Holmes passes the case onto Dr. Watson , who is portrayed as a Welsh eccentric. Upon arriving at the station, Sir Henry, Dr. Mortimer, Watson and Perkins  are halted by a policeman , who warns them of a murderer stalking the moors, before sending the group on their way. The Barrymores at Baskerville Hall mistreat Sir Henry and Watson, feeding them only cheese and water and then throwing them into a small bedroom, ankle-deep in water. Watson then goes to the village to send a message to Holmes , and meets Mr. Stapleton of Merripit Hall. Stapleton is carrying a chihuahua that proceeds to urinate in Watson's pocket and face. Arriving at Merripit Hall, Watson meets the eccentric Mrs. Stapleton, who displays surreal symptoms suggesting demonic possession. Late at night, Sir Henry and Watson discover the Seldons and the escaped murderer, whom Watson recognizes as Mrs. Barrymore's brother Ethel Seldon , having a family dinner. Oddly enough, neither of the men seems to panic at this. Afterward, Holmes arrives and examines the case so far. An invitation arrives for Sir Henry, asking him to dinner at Merripit Hall. Suspecting a trap, Watson goes along with Sir Henry while Holmes observes carefully. Mrs. Stapleton resumes her bizarre acts and begins to vomit pale-blue liquid over Sir Henry, whilst Mr. Stapleton's chihuahua urinates in Watson's soup. Ordered to leave in disgrace, the Stapletons, Dr. Mortimer, Mr. Frankland , and his wife Mary  follow Sir Henry and Watson to kill them, but become trapped in a quagmire. Holmes then proceeds to reveal that the Hound is no more than a large, rather friendly Irish wolfhound owned by the late Sir Charles Baskerville, whose excited barking was misinterpreted as a monstrous beast. He also states that the dog is the sole heir of Sir Charles. With the dog gone, the would-be murderers would have gained the Baskerville fortune and the estate. The film ends on the pianist, who is then hit by vegetables from the audience.

When asked to speak in his own defense, Jim pauses and reflects to say, ""I accuse my parents"" for not giving him the home life he should have had. The film flashes back to a day in high school when Jim was given an award for an essay describing the ideal home he supposedly has. Eager to tell his parents, he goes home to a house full of empty alcohol bottles and parents distracted by arguing with each other. Jim is embarrassed when his mother  shows up drunk to the graduation planning committee. Later, his father  gives him money instead of celebrating his birthday with him. Jim gets a job selling shoes after school and meets torch singer Kitty Reed . He delivers a pair of shoes to her house and then meets her later at the nightclub where she works. The two begin dating, Jim unaware that Kitty is also the moll of gangster Charles Blake , who specializes in fencing stolen jewelry. Blake identifies Jimmy as sufficiently gullible and recruits him to deliver packages and messages after work and school. Jim gets paid highly for his errands, so he never questions what exactly he is delivering. Charles forces Kitty to break up with Jimmy after he realizes that their relationship is becoming serious. Shortly afterward, Jim drives two of Charlie's henchmen to a late-night ""errand,"" which turns out to be a robbery where a night watchman is shot. Realizing what he's gotten involved in, Jimmy turns to his father, who ignores him. Jimmy confronts Blake himself, but Blake threatens to kill him if he doesn't continue working for him. Later, after the police identify Jimmy as the driver of the getaway car, Blake sends his men to kill Jimmy, but the execution is interrupted by a couple who stumbles upon the scene, causing the men to flee and leave behind a wounded Jimmy. Fearing for his life, Jimmy packs a suitcase and spends an indeterminate amount of time hitchhiking and train-hopping. He eventually ends up in a small town where he attempts to rob a diner, but the kindly owner, Al ([[George Lloyd , recognizes Jimmy as a good boy in a bad situation and offers him safe harbor and a job, as long as he agrees to give up crime and start going to church. After a period of living and working for Al, Jimmy's life straightens up and he confesses to his crimes. Al agrees to accompany Jimmy back home to turn himself in. Back in Jimmy's hometown, Al takes him to confront Kitty, who confesses that she was forced to break up with him. Jimmy then goes to confront Blake one more time, in the hopes that Blake will also turn himself in to help clear Jimmy's name. Blake refuses and instead pulls a gun on Jimmy; Jimmy attempts to wrestle the gun away, accidentally shooting and killing Blake in the process. The police, alerted by Al, storm Blake's hideout and arrest his men, along with Jimmy. Back in the present, the judge, understanding why Jimmy accuses his parents, acquits Jimmy of manslaughter.

The authorities believe that he and four other scientists defected behind the Iron Curtain. Meanwhile, former U.S. Navy {{USS}} submarine commander Adam Jones  arrives in Tokyo after receiving a mysterious package containing $5,000. Jones meets Professor Montel and his colleagues, a group of scientists, businessmen, and statesmen who suspect the Communist Chinese are building a secret atomic base on an island somewhere north of Japan. They must have proof, so Montel offers Jones another $45,000 if he will command an old World War II-era Japanese submarine being overhauled and follow the Chinese freighter Kiang Ching, which has been making suspicious deliveries in that area. Jones reluctantly agrees- providing that the submarine is armed, and that he is also allowed to hire some of his former navy shipmates. The day before Jones is to conduct a test dive, news arrives that the Kiang Ching has sailed. Despite Jones's protests that the submarine's torpedo tubes have not been inspected yet, and they are therefore too dangerous to use, there is no choice but to start out after the freighter. When Montel boards with his beautiful assistant, Professor Denise Gerard , the superstitious crewmen are upset, believing women on a ship are bad luck, but Montel insists she come along.  On the voyage, they are detected by a Chinese submarine. When contacted, the Chinese are not fooled by their explanation that they are on a simple scientific expedition and fire torpedoes at them without warning. Unable to fire back with his own torpedoes, Jones dives to the sea bottom, hoping to hide there; the Chinese follow. After several tense hours of waiting each other out, Jones finally decides to surface. When the other submarine does the same, Jones rams and sinks it. Jones wants to turn back, but Montel points out that their contract specifies that he won't be paid unless Montel is satisfied. They continue to follow the Kiang Ching to an island. Jones and Montel land to investigate, but Montel is disappointed by the low radioactivity levels he detects. After a firefight with Chinese soldiers, the patrol returns to the submarine with a captive. They learn the location of another island from the prisoner, a pilot named Ho-Sin. During a storm en route, Montel is injured. Because he is too hurt to go ashore, Montel insists Jones take Denise in his place, since she is the only other person qualified to gather and interpret the data. Denise detects an extremely high level of radioactivity; then she is forced to shoot and kill a Chinese soldier who stumbles upon her. Back aboard the submarine, Jones is worried because he recognized an American B-29 bomber sitting on an airstrip. Needing more information, they trick it out of Ho-Sin by putting the ship's cook Chin Lee , dressed in a Chinese uniform and beaten by Jones at Chin Lee's insistence, into the same room. Fooled, the captive reveals that the plane is going to drop an atomic bomb on either Korea or Manchuria the next day, with the blame placed on the United States, but Chin Lee slips up and Ho-Sin beats him to death before Jones can intervene. Jones decides to go ashore and watch for the bomber's takeoff. When he signals, the submarine will surface and try to shoot it down. However, Montel sneaks onto the island in his place. When Jones scolds Denise for not stopping the old man, she tearfully reveals that Montel is her father. The plane is shot down, but it crashes on the island, detonating the atomic bomb and killing Montel. Jones recalls that Montel had said earlier that ""Each man has his own reason for living and his own price for dying."""

While the former film emphasized family melodrama, the new film reduced these scenes to a string, concentrating on hallucinogenic international imagery in a manner looking forward to such films as Koyaanisqatsi and Baraka. In the film, scientific advances cause an outbreak of giant slugs, oversized bats, children with genetic mutations enhancing their physical or mental abilities, and bizarre changes in weather, such as snow falling on the pyramids. The film gets bleaker and bleaker, until Dr. Nishiyama hypothesizes a scenario that re-edits the climactic war footage from The Last War, augmenting them with a scene of the surviving humans, looking like sufferers of neurofibromatosis, fighting over who gets to eat a snake. Also notable in the film is the symphonic score composed and conducted by Isao Tomita, with Tomita overdubbing his performances on a synthesizer as a solo instrument. Although the film does utilize stock footage, primarily drawn from the film's little-seen ur-film, the film has its own unique special effects. One shot in particular, featuring a chain reaction of exploding vehicles, can be seen in The Return of Godzilla, where the shot was printed in reverse. In this film, the shot is intercut with scenes of human tragedy, as a mad driver tries to force his way through a traffic jam.

While accompanying his mother to Madikeri, Preetam confronts a man named Jaanu . Jaanu, who has been following Nandini, beats up Preetam thinking that he is in love with Nandini. Preetam, unaware that Jaanu has vowed not to allow any one near Nandini, trashes Jaanu and his gang in return. In Madikeri, Preetam meets Nandini unexpectedly. He identifies himself and expresses his love towards her and offers to tie the watch as an indication for their marriage. Nandini, who is already engaged rejects his request. Still, Preetam vows to marry Nandini if she meets him again. In the meantime, Preetam discovers that his host in Madikeri, Col. Subbayya  is Nandini's father, who is pretty much deaf, and Nandini's marriage is a just a week away. Dejected, Preetam throws Nandini's heart-shaped watch away. But Nandini calls him over the phone and taunts him to return. Delighted, Preetam goes in search of her watch and brings it back. While searching it, he spots a rabbit, which he calls Devadas, and brings it along with him. Since Nandini's friends are due to arrive from Mumbai for the marriage, Preetam takes Nandini to the railway station. The train from Mumbai is delayed by five hours, so Nandini and Preetam decide to visit a nearby hill-temple. While returning from the temple, Preetam and Nandini are caught in rain. An old couple offers Preetam and Nandini to take shelter inside their hut. Preetam, still in two minds about expressing his love to Nandini, grabs a couple of toddy bottles, goes out in rain and starts drinking. However, when Nandini walks towards him, offering an umbrella, he is under a state of intoxication and tells Nandini that he'd better stay away from Nandini to remain a decent boy, rather than to propose to or elope away with her. Nandini is now in love with Preetam and is in a dilemma as her wedding is due in a few days. Nandini requests him to take her to the top of a waterfall and expresses her love towards Preetam, standing at the edge of the waterfall. Preetam, intent on marrying Nandini, takes her father, Subbayya for a morning jog to discuss his marriage with Nandini. But Subbayya a heart patient, tells Preetham that he's expected to die anytime and his only aim in life is to get Nandini married off to Gautam . On the night before the marriage, Preetam drives away from the house without taking Devadas. He then starts drinking the whole night in a road-side bar. He finds Gautam, asking the bar-owner for directions to Subbayya's home. When Jaanu tries to kill Gautam, Preetam saves Gautam and convinces Jaanu that only Gautam is the best person to marry Nandini. Next day, he drops Gautam to the marriage house, just in time for the marriage. He then declines to attend Gautam's marriage. Gautam asks for the heart-shaped watch as a remembrance but Preetham does not agree to give it. Preetam then leaves. Meanwhile, on the wedding day everyone is searching for Preetam, but he is nowhere to be found. His mother is the only one who know the truth about his love, and is worried of his whereabouts, but does not show her worry. Resignedly, Preetam watches the arch proclaiming ""Gautham weds Nandini"". As he is leaving, he spots Devadas and takes it with him. He drives towards Bangalore, all the while expressing his disappointment to Devadas, but later he comes to know that Devadas is dead."

However, Sharpe is only wounded and manages to survive by pretending to be dead. Fourteen years later, in 1817, Sharpe, now a farmer in France, is summoned by his former commander, the Duke of Wellington ([[Hugh Fraser , to his London home, Apsley House, and asked to undertake one more mission for him: to find a man in India. The missing agent was trying to learn the identity of a turncoat officer advising a rebellious Maratha rajah. Sharpe refuses, unwilling to press his luck any further, until he learns that the agent is his old comrade in arms and best friend, Patrick Harper . Sharpe sets out for India. On his way to report to General Burroughs , he passes a group of soldiers escorting Celia Burroughs , the general's attractive daughter. After a short conversation with her, he rides on ahead. He is soon attacked by marauders, but is rescued by Patrick Harper, who shows up just in time with his signature 7-barrel gun. Celia Burroughs' escort is also attacked, by none other than Dodd; she is captured and taken to the fortress of Khande Rao , the nominal leader of the revolt. However, he is not yet of age and is under the influence of a regent, his late father's favourite concubine, Madhuvanthi , and her lover, now General William Dodd, who plan to kill Rao before he declares his majority.

The General is ill, so command has passed to an old, bitter foe of Sharpe's, the cowardly General Sir Henry Simmerson . Simmerson refuses to act without orders and reinforcements from Agra. However, when Sharpe requests permission to infiltrate the enemy fortress, Simmerson is only too happy to allow him to risk his life. Sharpe and Harper, posing as deserters, are welcomed by the rebels. Sharpe makes the acquaintance of former French Colonel Gudin , a fellow veteran of the Battle of Waterloo two years earlier. Gudin has been hired to train the men. Meanwhile, General Burroughs recovers his health, dismisses Simmerson, and commences the siege. Sharpe discovers that Dodd has laid a trap for the British: they will attempt their breach of the wall just where he has mined it with barrels of gunpowder. In a skirmish, some British soldiers are captured, among them Sergeant Shadrach Bickerstaff , who had clashed with Sharpe earlier. To avoid torture and execution, Bickerstaff betrays Sharpe. Sharpe and Harper are beaten and imprisoned, but Gudin, disgusted by the barbaric execution of prisoners, helps Sharpe and Harper escape, just as the British launch their assault. Gudin next attempts to free Celia, but is murdered by Bickerstaff. Sharpe and Harper successfully set off the gunpowder prematurely, resulting in a huge explosion which kills many defenders. Harper encounters and shoots Bickerstaff, while Sharpe goes off in search of Dodd. When it is clear the fortress has fallen, Dodd prepares to flee.

Realizing she'll be fired if she doesn't deliver him to the concert, she takes a cooler full of ice water and dumps it on Cat Fight's bed. Casey manages to get Cat Fight and the three women  into the car. Despite many shenannigans, including Cat Fight stealing the panties from a senior citizen, Casey manages to bring him into the arena just in time for the concert. Then he barely makes it onto the stage with the girls in time. The following day, McBride learns of the incident involving the senior citizen and prepares to fire her. However, Cat Fight's manager comes in and personally thanks both McBride and Casey for delivering Cat to the concert on-time... a first for him. The act manages to temporarily prevent her firing. Casey is assigned to transport Battle Witherspoon, an arrogant, heartless, workaholic executive who is stalking his ex-girlfriend. The angry ex tells him she can no longer stand to be with him and says she is pregnant with another man's child. Casey, sympathetic, offers visibily devastated Battle some liquor from the onboard bar. After consuming an excessive amount, Battle runs out of the car and strips his clothes off, running through a park, making a huge nuisance of himself. He finally returns to the limo and passes out. Not knowing where Battle's residence is, Casey takes him to her home so he can recover from the day's events. The following morning, he awakens and is back to his old hateful self, hurtfully insulting Casey before leaving. Unbeknownst to Casey, Battle Witherspoon is actually the son of the Mr. Witherspoon, the owner of the limo company.

Daniel's brother Robert , a renowned novelist living in New York City, would rather spend his money on a first class airline ticket to England than help finance the funeral, leaving Daniel to cover the burial expenses. As guests begin to arrive at the family home, where the funeral service is to be held, he struggles to complete a eulogy, although everyone expects Robert the writer will be the one to deliver some appropriate remarks. Daniel's cousin Martha  and her fianc√© Simon  are desperate to make a good impression on Martha's uptight father Victor . Their hopes for doing so are dashed when Martha, hoping to calm Simon's nerves, gives him what she believes is Valium but actually is a designer hallucinogenic drug manufactured by her brother Troy , a pharmacy student. While on the way to the funeral, Simon begins to feel its effect. A dwarf named Peter  introduces himself to Daniel, who is too busy to speak to him at that moment and suggests they talk later. None of Daniel's relatives can identify the man. The service begins and the hallucinating Simon, certain he hears scratching noises in the coffin, tips it over, causing the body to spill out onto the floor. During the ensuing chaos, Martha drags Simon outside, where her father forbids her to marry him. When Simon is told why he is reacting as he is, he panics and locks himself in the upstairs bathroom. Martha tries to persuade him to open the door while fending off the unwelcome advances of Justin , with whom she once had a one-night stand that she deeply regrets and would like to forget. When the drug overcomes Simon, he steps out of the window naked and sees Justin kissing Martha. Thinking what he sees reflects mutual feelings, he proceeds to climb onto the roof, where he threatens to jump. Hoping to calm him, Martha reveals she is pregnant with their child. While most of the guests are caught up in Simon's seeming insanity, Peter meets privately with Daniel and Robert and reveals he was their father's lover. Unhappy that he was left nothing in their father's will, Peter reveals photographs that prove his relationship, and attempts to blackmail the family for ¬£15,000. The brothers panic and bind and gag Peter, and to calm him down they give him the hallucinogenic drug they also believe is Valium. Peter manages to free himself, but in his drug-induced state he jumps repeatedly on the sofa before falling and hitting his head on a glass coffee table. Troy and germaphobic family friend Howard  cannot feel a pulse, so they believe Peter to be dead. Forced to dispose of the body as quickly and surreptitiously as possible, Daniel and Robert decide to place it in the casket with their father. The service resumes, and Daniel's awkward eulogy is interrupted when the still very-much-alive Peter leaps from the coffin and the compromising photos fall out of his pocket for everyone, including the widow, Sandra , to see. Daniel demands everyone stay calm and declares his father was a good man, although clearly one with secrets, and he delivers a loving tribute to the man. That same night after the all the mourners  have left, Robert tells Daniel that he plans on taking their mother to New York so that Daniel and Jane can finally buy their own flat and live alone like they'd always wanted. Their conversation is interrupted when Jane shows up and tells them that Uncle Alfie  will be staying over that night because of his panic attack after having seen Daniel and Robert move the body. She also tells them that she gave him some ""Valium"" , which shocks Daniel and Robert. The scene cuts to a shot of Uncle Alfie on the roof, naked like Simon had been, complaining about how ""everything is so fucking green""."

Things worsen when Eris takes possession of Eri's body and kidnaps the goddess Athena to Eris' own Sanctuary. Eris plans to gain control of the world by sucking all the energy out of Athena with the golden apple to seize her body, and revives dead Saints of the past to fight for her, dubbing them Ghost Saints, and also Ghost Five.

Jerry appears from under the table and climbs on the tablecloth, observing the room as she sets out plates. When Mammy leaves the room, Tom appears from underneath a houseplant and rushes to the phone; first, though, he must keep Jerry out of the cracker spread. Tom knocks Jerry out with a spoon, returns to the phone and calls the girl cat to invite her to dinner. At dinner Jerry performs menial duties for the cats, such as carrying food and blowing on Tom's soup to cool it. Annoyed at being Tom's servant, Jerry drinks some soup, steps on Tom's spoon and spits the soup in his face. Tom puts the spoon  over a candle's flame, causing Jerry to jump off the spoon and land on some butter . The girl cat offers Tom bread, between which Jerry sandwiches Tom's tail. Charming his girlfriend, Tom pours ketchup on his tail sandwich and bites into it . Trying to stay cool for his date despite his discomfort, he does not see Jerry repeat the trick; when he looks at his tail he sees cream, a slice of pineapple and a maraschino cherry, and bites into it . Jerry is captured and made into a champagne-cork opener. After Tom opens the bottle he throws Jerry into a glass of water, pours two glasses of champagne and downs his. He hugs and kisses his sweetheart, but she resists his advances and hits him with a mallet . When Jerry laughs, Tom opens a cigar with Jerry's mouth and strikes a match on him. For this, Tom gets a pie in the face. When he throws a pie in return, he hits the girl cat when Jerry ducks. She throws three pies at her erstwhile boyfriend, but Tom ducks; when Jerry pokes him with a fork, he stands up in time for pie number four. Jerry runs along the table, into  Tom's open mouth. Thinking he has Jerry at last, Tom bites his own tongue. Jerry hits the tray with a spoon  before running away. Jerry then hides in a roast turkey; as Tom sticks knives into it, he escapes and mimics yowls of pain. Tom hears the cries after puncturing the bird, spots Jerry and pokes him with a knife. To protect himself, Jerry grabs Tom's tail and bites it. Tom jumps in pain, stopping and turning in midair when he sees that Jerry planted another knife just below him. Tom chases Jerry across the table, but Jerry stops and stabs him. The cat runs behind a punch bowl and finds two dinner rolls, which he eats. Since Tom wants more, Jerry hides a salt shaker in a third roll and throws it into Tom's mouth. Jerry then hides in a candelabra and uses a candle to light Tom's tail. Oblivious, Tom lights a cigarette from his tail; when he realizes his tail is on fire, he rushes off to sit on what he thinks is an ice bucket . He sees the girl cat shaking her head and smells burning; when he asks her, ""Hey, what's cooking?"" she replies, ""You are, stupid!"" Tom thinks she is kidding until the heat makes him jump through the ceiling, crash onto the table and break a plank from it. The plank flips, creating an incline to the punchbowl. Tom's bow tie gets tangled with his burnt tail. Jerry writes S.S. Drip on his back; he and the girl cat ""christen"" him with a bottle of champagne like a ship, and send him sliding into the punchbowl.  * Lillian Randolph as Mammy Two Shoes   * Thea Vidale as Mammy Two shoes   * Sara Berner as girl cat  * William Hanna as Tom"

Skip employs the use of an agency asset, Ziyad Abishi who blows cover to a terrorist from the safe house, as he flees to inform his colleagues of their exposure, Ferris makes chase and kills him in such a place and manner that one might believe the death to be random. Salaam  corroborates the acceptance of killing by those whom remain at the safe house; and Ferris accuses Hoffman of running ""side operations"" which interfere and  undermine operational integrity of primary operation and tells Hoffman to stop. While going to the hospital to receive rabies shots for bites suffered during the pursuit and elimination of the terrorist, Ferris meets a nurse named Aisha , and he begins developing romantic feelings for her. The bombers strike again in an Amsterdam flower market, and kill at least 75 people. Having recognized one of the men living in the safe house as former small-time criminal Mustaffa Karami , Salaam takes Karami into the desert and coerces him into working for Jordanian intelligence, threatening to set him up as a collaborator if he does not co-operate. Hoffman asks Salaam to use Karami, but he refuses, believing a greater return will come later. Unknown to Ferris and Salaam, Hoffman tells Ferris' CIA subordinate  to follow Karami and kidnap him. Karami escapes and notifies the terrorists in the safe house that it is being watched, and they abandon it. Ferris's partner is caught and Salaam accuses Ferris of having had knowledge of the move on Karami, and blames Ferris's duplicity with him for the destruction of the safe house. He exiles Ferris from Jordan. Ferris returns to Hoffman in Washington, and they devise a new plan to find Al-Saleem. Suspecting he is motivated more by pride than ideology, they stage a fake terrorist attack and set up Omar Sadiki , an innocent Jordanian architect, as its instigator, hoping Al Saleem will come out of hiding and attempt to contact him. Al-Saleem sees TV news coverage of the attack and takes the bait. Salaam invites Ferris back to Jordan and shares his suspicions that Omar Sadiki is a terrorist, though Ferris feigns ignorance. Ferris later tries to save Sadiki from being kidnapped by Al-Saleem's henchmen but fails and sees his partner nearly killed in the subsequent car crash. Under interrogation, Sadiki denies any knowledge of the attack though he is later found beaten and killed. Ferris goes back to his apartment and finds out that Aisha has been kidnapped. He desperately asks Salaam for help, admitting he fabricated Omar Sadiki's terrorist cell and the attack. Salaam refuses to help because of Ferris earlier having lied to him. Ferris offers himself in exchange to Aisha's kidnappers, and is brought to the middle of the desert, with Hoffman watching everything via a surveillance drone unmanned aerial vehicle. Ferris is surrounded by a group of SUVs, which circle him to create an obscuring dust cloud before picking him up. The dust cloud Hoffman's view, so that he cannot determine which of the SUVs, now headed in different directions, is carrying Ferris. Ferris is taken across the border to Syria where he is to be interrogated by Al-Saleem. When Ferris asks Al-Saleem about Aisha, he is told that someone has lied to him and that he has been double-crossed. Ferris tells Al-Saleem that there is an infiltrator  in his organization who works for Ferris, and that, by association, Al-Saleem works for Ferris. Al-Saleem does not believe Ferris, beats him, turns on a video camera and orders his execution. Salaam and his agents arrive at the last moment, saving Ferris' life. Salaam visits Ferris in the hospital and reveals he had faked Aisha's abduction, and orchestrated Ferris's capture by Al-Saleem using Karami as a go-between. Having lost two fingers as well as the will to fight in this particular 'war', Ferris goes off the grid and goes to see Aisha again."

McIver must address the needs of a number of disturbed patients, among them Steven Holte, a possibly suicidal artist, and the self-loathing Mr. Capp. All of his responsibilities keep McIver so busy that his wife, Karen, feels increasingly frustrated and ignored. When new drapes are needed for the clinic's library, the dour and penny-pinching Victoria Inch orders unattractive ones. Karen McIver takes it upon herself to buy a more expensive and colorful set instead, gaining the approval of chairman of the board Regina Mitchell-Smythe but without the knowledge of her husband. What should be an insignificant matter is complicated further by Dr. McIver giving the patients, principally Stevie, permission to design and create the new drapes themselves. Personalities clash. Dr. Devanal, who has a drinking problem, has been having an affair with his secretary Miss Cobb and makes a clumsy pass at McIver's wife as well. McIver begins to fall in love with Meg Rinehart, a member of his staff. Vicki Inch privately schemes to expose the unseemly behavior of Devanal at the next meeting of the board and issues a veiled threat to do so to McIver as well, while Devanal's wife mistakenly believes McIver to be behind the plot to discredit her husband. Having felt stable enough to go on a date with Sue Brett, another patient, Stevie Holt is very upset to discover that new drapes have been installed, not the ones his artwork was meant to inspire. He disappears, causing a search party to look for him and McIver to fear a suicide. In the end, Stevie reappears, the McIvers agree to work on their marriage and Miss Inch decides not to disclose everyone's actions. A grateful Dr. Devanal, his reputation intact, submits his resignation to the board.

Upon arrival, they meet their boss Patrick , another counselor named Drew , who is teamed up as a co-counselor with Julie, and a few other counselors. The teenagers get to work, bringing in food, cleaning, etc. Julie gets a warning from the groundskeeper, Henry, who claims there is danger in these woods. Julie questions Patrick about it, and he brushes it off, saying that Henry is crazy. Late that night, the group sits around a campfire and decides to play a game of ""Bloody Murder"". One person is ""It"" and the rest of the group try to find ""It"" and whoever finds ""It"" must scream Bloody Murder and then everyone must run back to base before ""It"" can tag them. Everyone joins in, with Jason being it, and Jason and Dean play a prank on one of the counselors Brad . After the game, Dean witnesses Jason  making out with Whitney. We later see Jason getting dressed and is confronted by a figure... The next morning, Julie begins asking her fellow counselors about the whereabouts of Jason. Dean tells Julie that Jason said something about ""taking off for a few days"", but Julie still grows worried. The following night, the counselors gather in the mess hall for a movie, and Whitney goes to grab some food from the kitchen and is stabbed to death by a man in a hockey mask. The next day, the counselors inform Patrick that Jason and Whitney have gone missing, and they call the Sheriff who interrogates the group. Everyone suspects Dean, because he is Whitney's ex-boyfriend and he has been acting suspiciously. Dean is not provided with an alibi, so he is taken in for questioning. Julie encounters Henry again who tells her about her dad and a name of Nelson. She emails her Dad about it. Brad is killed next by the masked murderer and he goes missing, and Dean is off the hook for now. Julie gets an email reply from her dad, and he claims he doesn't remember a man named Nelson. Jason is suspected next, considering he had a past with Brad. Julie is attacked by the hockey-masked killer in the woods and she flees to the road, where she meets Dean who is stuck with a flat tire. She hurries back to camp, trying not to act scared, and Dean is killed by the murderer. Back at the camp, Julie finds a photo of her dad at the camp, along with a kid named Nelson Hammond. She searches him, and discovers that Nelson Hammond was almost killed in an accident involving the game ""Bloody Murder"". He then came back a few years later and killed one of the counselors that caused the prank and was sent to a mental institution. That night, Julie is attacked again by a man and he chases her to the mess hall and she locks him in the freezer. But the man is just Jason, who actually did take off, worried that Dean would tell about him cheating on Julie with Whitney, and he was worried because the police were after him. Jason is taken in by the police. The body count ups as another counselor, Doug is finished off. Julie's father arrives after hearing about the police, and Drew and Julie's father walk to the lake, as Julie retreats to her cabin to gather some things. There, she deduces the killer is Drew when she sees that Drew's father was Bill Anderson, the man that Nelson Hammond killed for revenge and that Drew is out for revenge. She races to the lake, where she discovers her father missing, and she accuses Drew. But she is proven wrong when the killer appears and attacks them. Drew is knocked out and Julie flees. Julie runs into Patrick, and then Patrick reveals he is the killer. He is really Nelson Hammond and is seeking revenge for his accident that the other counselors caused. He attacks Julie with an axe, and chases her through the woods. She runs to the camp, and the other counselors, the police, Patrick and Julie gather. Patrick tries to make it seem, Julie hit her head and is delusional. But Tobe sees the axe hidden behind his back, and points a gun at him. Patrick swings at Julie, just as a shot rings out, hitting Patrick's arm and it is revealed that Drew fired the shot. Patrick is taken in, Julie's father is safe, and Julie starts having a love interest in Tobe. At the police station, Patrick tells the Sheriff, that he didn't kill Doug, maybe it was Trevor Moorehouse hinting that Trevor is still out there..."

Upset, Tracy leaves with Mike, while Sofie reveals Tracy's brother, Jason , disappeared at the camp years previously, believed to be dead at the hands of the local myth Trevor Moorehouse. While taking Tracy back to her cabin, Mike upsets her, so he returns back to the bonfire as the others are telling the story of Trevor Moorehouse, who was supposedly in an accident at the camp years ago and was put in a mental hospital.

Soon after, Mike and Ryan dress up as Trevor Moorehouse and scare James, causing a fight to break out. Everyone returns to their cabins apart from James, who remains at the fire. James is then confronted by the real Trevor Moorehouse, who chops off his legs with a machete, before crushing his head with a rock. The next morning, Tracy and Mike make up, before the counselors meet in the mess hall for breakfast with an angry Rick who tells the group that James left a note saying he was leaving the camp. Camp cook, Juanita  becomes scared, thinking Trevor Moorehouse murdered James, and so decides she will leave the camp later that day.

Back at camp, Tracy checks Rick's pager while he is in the shower, and finds that there are no pages from Ryan. At night, Sofie cooks the dinner to stop Rick from becoming suspicious. While Tracy checks the recordings once more, she discovers the footage has been altered. As Angela searches for Ryan's pager, Trevor Moorehouse murders her with a machete.

He finds himself drawn back to police work when Megan Rose , the daughter of a United States senator, is kidnapped from her exclusive private school by computer science teacher Gary Soneji . U.S. Secret Service Special Agent Jezzie Flannigan , held responsible for the breach in security, joins forces with Cross to find the missing girl. Soneji contacts Cross by phone and alerts him to the fact one of Megan's sneakers is in the detective's mailbox, proving he's the kidnapper. Cross deduces the man is obsessed with the 1932 Charles A. Lindbergh Jr. kidnapping and hopes to become as infamous as Bruno Hauptmann by committing a new ""Crime of the Century"" that might be discussed by Cross in one of his true crime books. Megan's kidnapping proves to be only part of Soneji's real plan: to kidnap the son of the Russian president, Dimitri Starodubov , guaranteeing himself greater infamy. After Cross and Flannigan foil his second kidnapping plot, a supposed call from the kidnapper demands that Cross deliver a ransom of $10 million in diamonds by following an intricate maze of calls made to public phone booths scattered throughout the city. Cross ultimately tosses the gems out the window of a rapidly moving Metro train to a figure standing by the tracks. When Soneji later arrives at Flannigan's home and confronts Cross after disabling Jezzie with a taser, the detective realizes the kidnapper is unaware of the ransom demand and delivery. Soneji tries to leave with Flannigan but Cross kills him. Cross becomes suspicious and realizes that someone discovered Soneji long before his plot came to fruition. After searching Flannigan's home computer, he finds enough evidence to prove that Jezzie and her fellow Secret Service agent, Ben Devine ([[Billy Burke , used Soneji as a pawn in their own plot. He tracks them down to a secluded farmhouse where Flannigan has murdered Devine and is now intent on eliminating Megan Rose. Cross saves Megan and shoots Flannigan in the heart, killing her."

The film begins as they travel on horseback to Elsinore, contemplating fate, memory and language. Rosencrantz finds and continually flips a coin which always comes up heads, causing Guildenstern to conclude that something is wrong with reality. They meet a travelling troupe of tragedians on the way, and during their conversation with the lead Player, they are mysteriously transported into the action of Hamlet at Elsinore. They wander around the castle, trying to catch up to the action and understand what is going on by listening to other parts of the play. They are asked by the Danish royal couple to stay awhile in order to help find out the cause of, and hopefully cure, Prince Hamlet's gloomy state. They spend their time outside the scenes in Hamlet trying to figure out what is wrong with the prince and what is required of them. The remainder of the play follows the Shakespearean drama whenever the two characters are ""on stage,"" while the title heroes remain largely occupied with the futile hazards of daily life whenever the ""main action"" is elsewhere. Soon the very same theatre troupe arrives to play at court, as part of the Bard's tragedy. The Player simultaneously forbids them to stop watching their real play on the road, which cannot exist without an audience, and explains some of the plot and logic of conventional rules of plot-staging and -writing. Ultimately, they are sent to England and outside the action of the play again. The final part takes place on the ship to England, where they read the letter they are to deliver with Hamlet ‚Äì discovering that it is an order for his death. They decide to pretend they never saw it. Hamlet replaces the letter, and  escapes on an attacking pirate ship. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern worry about what they are to do now that Hamlet is gone, unaware that Hamlet has altered the letter so that it calls for their death rather than his own. The Player finishes the action by reading the letter that sentences them to death, and both Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are hanged. The film ends with the tragedians packing up their cart and continuing on their way."

Then he receives a new bag and follows the garbage down the line all the way to the cliff, but falls off. Next, he attempts to conceal the garbage under a bush, but a rabbit pushes it out in disgust. Next, he tries to burn it with a match, only to be stopped by Smokey Bear!  Finally, Humphrey puts all of the trash into a hollow stump, which is actually a geyser named ""Ol' Fateful"". The ranger prepares to reward Humphrey with a whole dish full of cacciatore but before Humphrey can take it, the geyser suddenly erupts, spouting garbage everywhere, resulting in Humphrey having to start all over at cleaning up the park."

Cargill willingly admits his guilt and brings forth evidence that proves that he signed a germ-warfare confession and broadcast anti-American speeches over the radio, seemingly an act of treason. It seems to be an open and shut case, were it not for Cargill's inexplicable refusal to defend himself. Arousing further suspicion is the fact that his collaboration immediately followed the deaths of two of his soldiers, and the surviving members in the unit all recite an identical, rehearsed account of those deaths. Edwards' commander, General Connors , has a strong personal interest - his son, Captain Joe Connors , was one of the two deaths - and presses Edwards to recommend a court-martial, but Edwards delves into the mystery, refusing to accept the facile explanations. In the end, the shocking truth comes out. Lieutenant George Miller  reveals that after Lieutenant Harvey  was killed trying to escape, the rest of the men discovered that, under torture, Captain Connors had betrayed him. Over Cargill's strong objections, they decided to execute Connors; Miller picked the short straw and had to strangle him. Meanwhile, their captor, Colonel Kim , had given Cargill an ultimatum: give in, or all his men would be executed. General Connors is crushed that his son collaborated and calls him a traitor. Cargill argues with Connors' judgment, stating that there must be a time limit on being a hero. He denounces the unwritten ""Code"" espoused by General Connors for demanding too much from soldiers, but General Connors reminds him that while Cargill anguished over the lives and families of 16 men, that many commanders had to anguish over the effect of their orders on the lives and families of thousands. Edwards agrees with General Connors that although Cargill acted out of a humane selflessness, Cargill's judgment was flawed. He recommends that all charges be dropped, but warns Cargill that there will be a court-martial, but Edwards himself will defend Cargill. Maybe they won't come up with all the answers, Edwards tells him, but ""they'll know we asked the questions""."

Once at a dockside warehouse, the frozen Velociraptors escape, who kill many of the terrorists before the police arrive, who expect to find drug smugglers. After finding the sole survivor, the police are killed inside the warehouse by the Velociraptors. An anti-terrorist special force led by Colonel Rance Higgins is called in by General Mercer where they find pieces of bodies and a refrigeration truck rather than uranium. They maneuver through warehouse boxes until two get slashed to death. The survivors learn from Dr. Hodges that these are the last three ""carnosaurs"" in existence: two male Velociraptors and one female T-Rex left from the genetic reconstructions of the previous Carnosaur installments. It is made clear that the dinosaurs need to be caught alive, relating to the potential for curing major diseases. A massive meat shipment resides at the dock, so the three soldiers hunt in that area, meeting up with a unit of Marines who have come as backup. Soldier Polchek is given drugs to shoot into the carnosaurs as the group set up a lure and net trap with meat. One of the carnosaurs attacks and almost succeeds in dragging off Polchek, but is shot down. Hodges soon theorizes that the T-Rex is breeding since Polchek was being dragged off, perhaps to hatchlings. The next plan is to destroy the ship they're on into the Pacific and freeze the dinosaurs somehow. When time comes to explore the lower decks of the ship, the carnosaurs knock out the lights and kill a couple more soldiers. The rest get to an elevator, but a dinosaur chews the cable through and they crash on the bottom level, discovering the nest of eggs which they begin to shoot, causing the T-Rex to become mad, ripping off Polchek's arm. Rance and Proudfoot rejoin Dr. Hodges and Marine Rossi, split up again and rig dynamite. Rossi is eaten by the Rex; Proudfoot's head is ripped off; and the remaining two shoot two of the dinosaurs. Hodges senses the T-Rex is close. She and Rance hide behind lockers which the T-Rex head-butts. Rance throws an explosive in the mouth of the dinsosaur, killing it. The two race against time to jump in the ocean before the ship explodes. As a cliffhanger, back in the police car at the port, the sole surviving terrorist is still gagged in the back seat where a dinosaur soon appears.{{cite web}}"

He is furious when requested to print a public apology in Billboard and becomes increasingly abusive toward Myra. It was during one of these abusive episodes that Myra informs Jerry Lee that she is pregnant, and he collapses into Myra's arms, crying hysterically. Jerry Lee and Myra attend a church service conducted by Swaggart. When Jimmy offers one more chance to become saved and get right with God, Jerry Lee again refuses, declaring, ""If I'm going to hell, I'm going there playing the piano!"" The caption preceding the closing credits reads, ""Jerry Lee Lewis is playing his heart out somewhere in America tonight."""

She backs away too far and gets killed by a truck. Ryouko Kagami, a representative of the Cosmo Mart chain, is looking is to take Mitsuya into the chain on behalf of her boss, Tejima. She explains to the shop owners, Mr and Mrs Kitura, that Tejima could not come as he was in an accident. Asked for more details, Ryouko explains that that his feet were amputated, which the Kituras find amusing. Kitura tells her she must do the inventory like Tejima promised before they allow them to stock Cosmo Mart products. Nao Niigaki, the young woman who works the morning part-time shift, becomes friends with Ryouko. Ryouko goes to do the inventory and a customer in a hooded winter coat comes in and starts reading a magazine. Nao tries to get a good look at his face but can only see darkness. Later, a man comes in and buys a product for 666 yen. While walking home, that man encounters a white ball which has rolled from a dark alley. He picks up the ball and walks into the alley where a voice asks him to return the ball. He walks into the darkness, disappears, and the ball is bounced outside again. While Nao sorts the drinks in the freezer, she sees a pair of eyes staring back at her. Ryouko, while doing inventory, finds a product that expired three years ago. She questions the Kituras, who blankly continue staring in the video camera of the store. Two crows crash into the window, killing themselves. Nao and Ryouko go to outside to investigate, where the Kituras are somehow already present with a hose. They hose away the crow remains, laughing madly. The night-shift part-timer, Komori, takes Nao's position. That night, a man and woman buy products for 699 yen and 999 yen respectively. On the way home, the woman is stalked by a man with a sledgehammer, who eventually appears inside her apartment and attacks her. The next day, Ryouko receives a call from Tejima, who tells her ""everyone has feet"" before the signal becomes static. Tejima puts the phone down and murmurs ""Ghosts don't have feet"" and continues to watch people pass by in his wheelchair. That night, Komori serves the hooded man who was in the shop the previous day. The till registers 44.44444 yen, and Komori looks up and finds only blackness in the hood. The man then forces Komori's head inside the hood. Komori comes out in shock and panic. Ryouko arrives and sees that one of Komori's eyes has monstrously bulged out of his sockets. The Kituras smile blankly at Komori. Ryouko takes his shift for him and sells products to a woman for 666 and a man whose total was originally 907 until he was hypnotized by steamed buns. He buys one and the price changes to 999. That night, the woman  was cooking food for her boyfriend until a blackout occurred. She opens her fridge to find a long lit-up corridor. Confused, she closes it and the light returns to her house. She opens it again to find a pale girl coming out of the corridor. She climbs out and continues to get closer to the woman. A hand appears behind her and she turns around to find the girl. The woman takes the knife and stabs her. The camera reveals that the girl behind her was actually her boyfriend and that she only sees the ghost. The woman is then shown to have suffocated by a bag over her head, it is unknown if she committed suicide or the ghost finished killed her. The camera zooms onto a picture on the fridge of her and her boyfriend, with the ghost disfiguring half her face. That same night, the man  is at a Japan bathhouse. He pays the old man in front who is blankly staring at the screen and enters the bathhouse. While taking a bath, he find a weird bloodstain, moving shadows and somebody's hair. When he exits the bath, he slips on the hair and is knocked unconscious. When he wakes up, the old man is over him asking if he is okay. The old man then suddenly grabs the man's head and smashes his head on the corner of a slab, likely killing him. He grabs the man's steamed bun and eats it while watching the television. That same night, Nao is walking home until she arrives at a railway with a train running through it. The hooded man appears and tries to pull her toward the train. She resists until the train passes and the hooded man disappears. While on her way to work, Nao finds a homeless woman who tells her to come with her to learn more about the store. Nao examines the baby carriage the woman is pushing to find a china doll in there. Nao leaves with the woman, looking back to find Komori staring blankly into space like the Kituras. Nao and the woman talk at the park. Ryouko, passing by, joins them. The woman reveals that the man who owned the store was a very evil man who abused everyone. While building the store, the owner abused his contractor in many ways with money. The contractor, in anger, broke all the tombstones of people without families and used the fragments to build the foundation. This explains why the store is haunted. Ryouko tells Nao to stop working there. Nao plans to save Komori before he becomes insane like the Kituras. Nao comes to the store to find Komori in the bathroom hypnotized by the eyes of a ghost. The ghost draws Komori toward it until Nao saves him. Komori, regaining his mind, runs out of the store where, in the sun, he baptizes himself in the river. He throws away his jacket, regains his composure, and leaves with Nao. Ryouko, walking toward Mitsuya to work, finds a wheelchair rolling down the hill. Temija tells her every ghost does not have feet and he is happy. Ryouko thanks him and walks away from Mitsuya. The movie goes back to the beginning, now shot from Yuko's point of view, where she sees the tortured souls in the store."

The man then forces Komori's head inside the hood. Komori comes out in shock and panic. Ryouko arrives and sees that one of Komori's eyes has monstrously bulged out of his sockets. The Kituras smile blankly at Komori. Ryouko takes his shift for him and sells products to a woman for 666 and a man whose total was originally 907 until he was hypnotized by steamed buns. He buys one and the price changes to 999. That night, the woman  was cooking food for her boyfriend until a blackout occurred. She opens her fridge to find a long lit-up corridor. Confused, she closes it and the light returns to her house. She opens it again to find a pale girl coming out of the corridor. She climbs out and continues to get closer to the woman. A hand appears behind her and she turns around to find the girl. The woman takes the knife and stabs her. The camera reveals that the girl behind her was actually her boyfriend and that she only sees the ghost. The woman is then shown to have suffocated by a bag over her head, it is unknown if she committed suicide or the ghost finished killed her. The camera zooms onto a picture on the fridge of her and her boyfriend, with the ghost disfiguring half her face. That same night, the man  is at a Japan bathhouse. He pays the old man in front who is blankly staring at the screen and enters the bathhouse. While taking a bath, he find a weird bloodstain, moving shadows and somebody's hair. When he exits the bath, he slips on the hair and is knocked unconscious. When he wakes up, the old man is over him asking if he is okay. The old man then suddenly grabs the man's head and smashes his head on the corner of a slab, likely killing him. He grabs the man's steamed bun and eats it while watching the television. That same night, Nao is walking home until she arrives at a railway with a train running through it. The hooded man appears and tries to pull her toward the train. She resists until the train passes and the hooded man disappears. While on her way to work, Nao finds a homeless woman who tells her to come with her to learn more about the store. Nao examines the baby carriage the woman is pushing to find a china doll in there. Nao leaves with the woman, looking back to find Komori staring blankly into space like the Kituras. Nao and the woman talk at the park. Ryouko, passing by, joins them. The woman reveals that the man who owned the store was a very evil man who abused everyone. While building the store, the owner abused his contractor in many ways with money. The contractor, in anger, broke all the tombstones of people without families and used the fragments to build the foundation. This explains why the store is haunted. Ryouko tells Nao to stop working there. Nao plans to save Komori before he becomes insane like the Kituras. Nao comes to the store to find Komori in the bathroom hypnotized by the eyes of a ghost. The ghost draws Komori toward it until Nao saves him. Komori, regaining his mind, runs out of the store where, in the sun, he baptizes himself in the river. He throws away his jacket, regains his composure, and leaves with Nao. Ryouko, walking toward Mitsuya to work, finds a wheelchair rolling down the hill. Temija tells her every ghost does not have feet and he is happy. Ryouko thanks him and walks away from Mitsuya. The movie goes back to the beginning, now shot from Yuko's point of view, where she sees the tortured souls in the store."

However, with the threat so high he soon lets loose and jeopardizes his family and friends.Jackson, Charreah . ""Hill Harper: Lessons on Love"". Essence. Retrieved June 14, 2011. This fear begins when he hears constant talk of terrorism on the news. He soon begins to have nightmares about himself and his family dying as a result of a nuclear terrorist attack. He searches on the internet for ""how to protect your family from a terrorist attack"". He ends up at a seminar he finds on a website that specializes in providing people with steps to prepare for an attack. There, he meets comedian Tom Arnold, who is also having fears of an attack. He and Arnold end up forming a close relationship later in the film. Carl begins to clean out his basement and convert it into a fallout shelter. He fills it with emergency supply items . This worries his wife Viv, who is pregnant. She sends him to a therapist, whom Carl dislikes. Viv is even more worried when Tom takes Carl out to the shooting range at a gun shop, where Carl buys a 9mm Glock pistol. He places it and some gold he buys in a safe, which is delivered by three shady-looking characters. The gold, safe, and gun are lost when the same guys who delivered the safe, rob Carl and tie him and Viv up in the shelter. During a scene when Carl is scanning his shelter for radiation, he sees a high radiation count in a plate he obtained from a homeless man earlier in the film. He returns the plate to him, however the man does not believe him and gives him a card to a mental health clinic. In one scene, Carl goes to a comedy club where Tom is performing, and hears Tom joking about him. He feels betrayed, and avoids contact with Tom. Carl soon begins to believe that America is a dangerous place, and he searches for a home in British Columbia. This leads to Viv and him being separated. Carl buys the new house and says goodbye to his wife when she is heading to work. Just as Carl is packing, Tom calls him, and apologizes for his stage performance. He then tells Carl that one of his friends deep in the government reported that bomb disposal units have been dispatched to downtown L.A., where an armed suitcase nuke had been found. Tom has saved two seats in a jet for him and Viv to escape from the impending attack. Carl agrees to go along and gets his dog, and then tries to warn Viv. She does not believe him and hangs up on him. Carl then calls his students and warns them to take shelter. The Emergency Alert System comes on the air and broadcasts an EAN warning of the terrorist attack. Carl calls Viv again, who now believes him but cannot leave because she is working the crisis at City Hall. He shows up at the airport, and tells Tom he's not going. He gives Tom his dog and drives to the government building to find Viv and take shelter. With two minutes left until the bomb detonates, he finds her working the 911 service. When he tells Viv to go to the shelter with him, she expresses concerns about the people needing help. In the last seconds before detonation, Viv and Carl say they love each other one last time.

While filming, he discovers a man attempting to break into his rental car. After foiling the man's attempt, Helms prepares to drive away but is thwarted by the man smashing the driver's window. Helms, however, succeeds in escaping the crazed man, but receives a minor cut on his hand. A few days later, in Frankfurt, Germany, Captain James Holland , amidst preparations for his forthcoming transatlantic flight as Captain of Quantum Airlines Flight 66, is told by his doctor he does not have cancer. On board Flight 66, a Boeing 747, Helms  is assisted to his seat by flight attendant Brenda Hopkins . Shortly after takeoff, Helms rises from his seat and falls into cardiac arrest, and Brenda gives him CPR. Head flight attendant Barb Rollins  notifies Holland of the emergency, and the Captain and his check pilot, Daniel Robb ([[Richard Lawson  set a course for London's Heathrow Airport,. However they are turned away when British Air-Traffic Control informs them that one of the passengers  could be infected with a deadly strain of influenza. Several harrowing events follow. The President  unsuccessfully tries to sneak Flight 66 into RAF Mildenhall, disguised as a USAF fighter plane and guided in by another, despite a recommendation otherwise by U.S. Secretary of State Lee Lancaster , but the British forces at the base jam the runway with emergency vehicles. Holland threatens to land anyway, only to pull up at the last minute, showing the U.S. Government how desperate the situation is. Soon thereafter, an investigation is set in motion by the Central Intelligence Agency. Flight 66 lands at the U.S. air base in Iceland, but one passenger is so distraught at being separated from her child and at being in quarantine that she runs down the airplane stairs and is shot and killed by U.S. troops in MOPP gear. Holland flies the aircraft toward Mali, but a female intelligence agent warns Holland that an assassin is trying to destroy the flight. Holland tricks the assassin  into crashing and lands on Ascension Island. The book mentions that the virus becomes less lethal and enters the human population. The movie indicates that the flight attendant who gave Helms CPR died a year after the incident, presumably from the virus.

Each scenario is presented one after the other with little regard for narrative continuity.Goodall p. 112 The opening scene introduces a Patagonian hunter who hunts stags to survive. The opening credits play over as he chases after a stag, which he ultimately shoots, kills, and beheads. Afterwards, one of the numerous scenes of anti-hunting gatherings is shown, this one in Cape Cod. The attention quickly shifts to wildlife hunting, where a monkey is killed by a leopard, and then a squirrel monkey by an anaconda. The theme changes again to the social hunt of wild game in Australia and Africa. Aborigines hunt kangaroos and other large marsupials with spears and giant bats with boomerangs. Indigenous tribes of Africa hunt large game, including antelope, buffalo, and elephants, in the savanna. Religious ceremonies are also shown, where the African hunters proceed to suck fresh blood from the entrails of an antelope, and the Australian aborigines symbolically bury their prey in dust to placate the spirits of the animals. Lastly, two brothers are arrested after partaking in a form of ritual post-mortem cannibalism of three of their relatives to acquire the hunting skills of the dead. Other hunting traditions then follow, again rooted in religion. The warriors of the Kuru tribe in Africa commit a sacred act in which they copulate with the ground in belief that it will make the Earth fertile and produce animals for the hunt, and a stag hunt in France, rooted in ancient pagan beliefs of the Gauls, is blessed by a mass before the hunt takes place, during which the hunters and dogs chase and ultimately kill a fleeing stag. In a fox hunt, the Wild Fox Association sabotages the hunting efforts by serving wine laced with a laxative to the hunters and distracting the dogs with an Afghan bitch in heat. Their efforts are then connected to species conservation, and to exemplify that hunters are truly concerned in wildlife conservation, Argentine hunters capture an Andean condor to sell to a zoo. A collage of other conservation efforts is shown, including the tagging of white rhinoceroses, grizzly bears and elephants, which are shot with morphine darts. Argentinian deer and elephant seals are physically subdued and marked. Tourists on Africans safaris then come to view the conservation efforts, which the narrator claims to have seemingly negated the animals' violent instincts. This deception is demonstrated with the mauling of a tourist named Pit Dernitz by lions. Another anti-hunting demonstration becomes the film's focus, this time on the Isle of Wight. Nudity and intercourse are practiced freely amongst the demonstrators, and this is contrasted with ancient hunter-gathering groups, who had strict rules concerning nudity. The narrator argues that once hunting had left this group of people, so did their rules toward nudity. Also highlighted is the contradiction that though this people are against hunting, thousands of farm-raised animals had to die to support them. The focus changes to Humboldt Penguins, which cannot hunt because of polluted waters, and thus seem detached and without focus. This effect is compared to modern day Eskimos, who no longer hunt since the discovery of oil in their homeland and have fallen into depression and melancholy. To reverse the process, several groups of men go out and revive their hunting ways. Reflected in this is a montage of gun ownership, which the film relates to feelings of masculinity, followed by shots of illegal elephant poaching from Africa. To offset the dwindling number of game due to poaching, warriors from the Lobi tribe celebrate the ""Ceremony of Life"", in which they masturbate with ceremonial rods and pour the product into the river, hoping the animals will drink the semen and multiply. Attention shifts to large electronic probes in the Peruvian savanna used to measure the winds of El Ni√±o for optimal fishing conditions. Fishing birds are also electronically tagged so the prime fishing areas can be located based on the birds' fishing habits. This fish frenzy in South America is reflected in the salmon run in Alaska, where kodiak bears hunt and fight for prey. An examination of a hunting tradition in northern Europe follows, where falcons assist humans in hunting by catching wild game, such as rabbits and pheasants. Further collaboration with man and animal is highlighted, this time with cheetahs. To demonstrate the cheetah's speed and effectiveness, a chase between a group of cheetahs and ostriches is arranged, in which the birds are hunted down and killed. The next animal collaborators are dogs, which hunt wild boar in Patagonia and a puma which has attacked a herd of sheep and a shepherd. In cities, however, stray dogs are the ones hunted by dog catchers, which the narrator claims demonstrates that the hunt is still active, but the prey has changed. Indios also use dogs to hunt monkeys, but their efforts are compared to mercenaries hunting the Indios themselves to clear them from their native land for development. In one such instance, mercenaries retaliate against a death of a workman by hunting down a group of Indios, one of which they torture, castrate and murder. Various scenes of wildlife are then shown, after which orangutans are hunted to be sold to zoos. The film then ends with the coexistence of man and animal between Erik Zimen, an ecologist, and wolves, the group of animals he wishes to save."

The villagers have to sell all the cattle to be able to buy the boat tickets, but it still is not enough. Marek Orban has to smuggle horses to Poland. The second protagonist - customs officer Halva  arrives from Prague to protect the borders and the law of the new republic. Both men of honor and principle, they are led to conflict which results in a death of villagers and customs officers. The absurdity of this tragedy is underlined at the end of the film when the border is moved, the village becomes a part of Poland and in the background we can see Marek Orban smuggling horses from Poland to Poland.

The man gets off the bike, walks into a coffee shop, shoots one of the patrons with a pistol and then gets back on the motorcycle. The scene then cuts to various bystanders being interviewed about what the man looked like. The descriptions vary wildly, except for one thing ‚Äì the man walked with a limp. The police are then on the lookout for anyone with a limp. They arrest one man walking down the street carrying a briefcase. In the struggle to apprehend the man, his briefcase comes open, spilling the contents ‚Äì some sex toys ‚Äì onto the sidewalk. Because such items are illegal in Thailand, the man is arrested. At a nearby newsstand, another man witnesses the arrest. He turns and walks away ‚Äì with a limp. He is the gunman, and his name is Sergeant Sommai. After losing a leg fighting for the Thai Special Forces during the Secret War in Laos, Sommai now works as a barber in a small shop in a canal community of suburban Bangkok. One day Sommai is cutting hair, when his young son is attacked on a nearby footbridge by some neighborhood boys. They are taunting the boy for having a one-legged father and no mother. Sommai must leave the shop, making a customer angry, to attend to the boy. After the neighborhood bullies are chased away, Sommai's son collapses and starts having some sort of seizure. A local doctor is ill-equipped to treat the boy and recommends he be looked after at home. Sommai has a problem, being a single father, and needing to work, he must find someone else to look after the boy. He asks his vain, selfish ex-wife, who left Sommai after he lost his leg. She refuses. But Nid, the younger sister of his ex-wife, readily agrees. The two, with the boy, then bond as family unit. Meanwhile, the Bangkok press is abuzz with a police hero, Special Branch Inspector Thanu, known as the Black Hand, for the trademark black leather glove he wears on his gun hand. He cultivated a fearsome reputation, even though the kills he claims credit for were often the work of his subordinates. Thanu also has difficulties at home, with a dissatisfied wife. One of Thanu's subordinates, Officer Chalam, independently investigates the shooting by the one-legged gunman, and through methodical casework, he determines that the gunman is likely an ex-military man, which narrows the suspects down considerably. Chalam immediately suspects Sommai, however Thanu tries to divert attention to other cases. It turns out that Thanu was Sommai's lieutenant in the Secret War, and it was through Thanu's cowardly actions that Sommai was left on the field with a leg blown off, to be captured by the Pathet Lao while Thanu and the rest of platoon escape to safety on a helicopter. At all costs, Thanu would rather not confront his old sergeant again. Thanu goes as far as visiting Sommai at his barbershop, telling Sommai to go into hiding. Sommai's son's illness is growing worse. Another doctor says the cause is a tumor at the base of the boy's brain, and that a specialist doctor in an overseas hospital can possibly save the boy. The pressure is now on Sommai to take more assassination jobs. His wheelman is a mute motorcyclist named Khan, and the two plan more jobs. Chalam has disobeyed orders by Thanu to stay away from Sommai, and has informants following Sommai's every move. After one shooting is narrowly averted, leaving the intended target only injured, Thanu can no longer ignore Sommai. Thanu is then given the job of watching over an important government minister. Sommai has taken on the job of killing the minister, and succeeds. His mute motorcyclist friend Khan betrays him, but Sommai is able to free himself from Khan and kill him. He then visits his handler, just as his handler and another man are plotting Sommai's demise, obtains the payment, and then kills the two men. Sommai then goes to the hospital to retrieve his son. Thanu's team is waiting for him, but Sommai takes Thanu hostage. Holding an automatic pistol to Thanu's head, he and is able to obtain a promise from the prime minister that Nid and the boy will be allowed to leave the country. After Nid arrives at the airport and assures Sommai via two-way radio that she will be okay, Sommai surrenders, and hands his pistol to Thanu, who takes it and aims at Sommai's back, but then puts the gun down. However, Chalam raises his pistol, and against the orders of Thanu, who shouts ""No!"", fires, most likely killing Sommai."

The chase begins as normal, and is then paused for the Road Runner . The camera zooms back to the Coyote . The camera then zooms back to the Road Runner and the chase resumes. The camera now zooms out as Wile E. chases after the Road Runner with a knife and fork. The Coyote strikes - and misses, sticking the utensils into the road as the Road Runner moves into superspeed. Wile E, left suspended in the road, lets go of the fork and scratches his head, only to fall down. He slumps on the ground and soon comes up with a new plan.  The Coyote attaches a spring-activated boxing glove to a large rock and hides behind it, hoping to strike the Road Runner. However, the tension in the spring causes the rock and Wile E. to be launched backwards instead of the glove forwards. The glove then retracts backwards and punches the stunned Coyote in the face. Wile E.'s next plan is to traverse a tightwire and drop an anvil on the Road Runner, resulting in a ""Road Runner Burger"" as his drawing puts it. Obviously, the anvil is too heavy for the tightwire to handle, and Wile E. is stretched all the way to the ground and can be seen by the Road Runner, who taunts him before dashing off. Wile E. drops the anvil and is thus slung up into the air. Eventually, he peaks and falls downwards. Wile E. points expectantly at his backpack and pulls out a cord, hoping for a parachute; however, upon opening the pack, there is no parachute, simply common items like a hatchet and kitchen utensils. Wile E.'s expression darkens as he knows what will happen now, and he then pulls out a tablet of aspirin and takes one to alleviate the inevitable pain. He weakly waves at the camera as he takes the plunge. The Coyote then tries a new plan to explode the Road Runner with trickery: set out a water glass with two signs by it reading ""Last Water for 300 MILES"" and ""Free Drink of Water"". Of course, nothing provided by Wile E. Coyote is free. It comes with ""strings attached"", that is, a string to a TNT device, which, as he hopes, should eliminate the Road Runner. Wile E. hides as he hears the approaching Road Runner, who stops at the water stand, mockingly spits at it, and speeds behind the hiding Coyote with a tall, large sign that reads ""ROAD RUNNERS CAN'T READ AND DON'T DRINK"". The Coyote's expression turns from smug to incredulous to outraged in a matter of seconds. He chases the Road Runner into an Old Cactus Mine, but soon realizes he has no helmet or flashlight. He returns to the cap rack and dons a cap, and the Road Runner pulls up to him and provokes a chase through the mine. They chase in a straight line until the Road Runner loads himself into an elevator and speeds to safety. For this section of scene three, the camera cuts alternately to an actual-size view inside the mine and a Pac-Man style view. Their hats color-code the characters during the latter period: the Road Runner is green and the coyote is red. * Real time: The Coyote brakes before falling into the shaft and gets into another lift to the left. *Pac-Man: The Coyote's lift descends until he spots the Road Runner in another shaft to the right, and follows him through it. The Road Runner ascends a level, flies over a gap, and causes the coyote to pause, then to jump and hold onto... *Real time:...the edge of this tunnel, and then to disappear through that tunnel. *Pac-Man: The Road Runner continues running down a level and then back up the same way he came. *Real time: Wile E. is momentarily stalled by having to climb a ladder up the main shaft. *Pac-Man: The chase continues circling in this way and gets faster and faster until the Road Runner edges into the right shaft. The Coyote continues circling at ever-quicker speeds until the Road Runner beeps at him, which alerts him to continue the chase. Past this shaft is an up-and-down zigzag shaft; the Coyote and Road Runner follow this until the shaft changes into a straight tunnel to the right and one to the northeast. The Road Runner moves into the northeast tunnel, while the Coyote continues moving in the same pattern, bumping himself many times upon the ceiling and floor of the east shaft. Eventually, he knocks out his headlight. *Real time: Wile E. lights a match for light, but happens to be in an explosive-laden tunnel. The camera now cuts to above the surface. The explosion warps the cactuses currently on camera into the word ""YIPE!"". Back on the surface, Wile E. has loaded himself on a springboard in order to sling himself towards the passing Road Runner. When he cuts the rope holding him back, he is planted directly on the ground and the spring unfurls like a Slinky. The Coyote is now waiting for the Road Runner to make a turn so that he can chase him with an abstrusely designed rocket. He lights the fuse with perfect timing, but unfortunately, the rocket fires directly up into the sky and explodes into an EAT AT JOE'S sign. Now, Wile E. uses ACME's rocket-powered roller skates to prepare for the chase, which the Road Runner promptly begins by pulling up to the Coyote. The rocket thrust almost unseats the Coyote, but he manages to lift his midsection to normal height and begin a very promising chase. When the road takes a turn, however, the Coyote is catapulted off the end, his rear is bumped against the tops of several buttes, and he is then plopped on top of a high plateau. The skates are still functioning, and the jet blasts eventually join forces and continue to rush the Coyote forward. Wile E. is then thrown up into the sky, where the skates tucker out. The Coyote, knowing about the adverse effects of gravity on him, begins to pray then pulls out a wreath with R.I.P. on it as he falls into the ground. Wile E. climbs out of the hole he makes exhausted, and soon spots his ""Free Drink of Water"" trap set earlier in the cartoon. As he is thirsty, he lifts the glass and gets blown up. The fully recovered Coyote places a small railroad track, two bushes, himself, and a ""R.R. STOP"" sign in the middle of the road. This fails to stop the Road Runner, who mows down the Coyote and leaves him spread-eagled on the track to be flattened again by a train passing through additional tracks mysteriously set up. The Road Runner relaxes on the balcony of the caboose, with a ""THE END"" sign attached to the back of the caboose. That's All Folks!"

Coyote jumps out in front of the speeding bird with a knife and fork. Just before the utensils are about to hit, the ludicrous Latin names are shown: Road Runner: Acceleratti Incredibilis and Coyote: Carnivorous Vulgaris. The cartoon restarts in slo-mo, and the coyote stabs through his legs, ends up missing the Road Runner by a hair, and twists himself into a snail. With an enraged expression, he unravels himself and bounds after the bird. As the coyote gains on him, the Road Runner gears into superspeed and leaves all the roads in a cloud of dust. Wile slows down and hangs his face downwards, and plots his next scheme. 1. As the Road Runner speeds at 130&nbsp;mph acrossing the mountain roads, the coyote fires a bow loaded with some dynamite attached to an arrow. However, it's just like that - he fires the bow, and the dynamite explodes on himself. 2. The fuming coyote loads himself onto a slingshot; however, the support breaks out of the ground and wedges him into a stack of hay. 3. Wile E. Coyote now tries covering the ground with quick-drying cement to stop the Road Runner dead. Unfortunately, the Road Runner cuts directly through it without being touched, and the Coyote is drenched and soon frozen before he can escape. 4. Hoping to avoid being hit with loose ends, Wile hides himself under a manhole with an armed hand grenade, but the Road Runner passes through the road fast enough to drop a boulder on top of the cover, which prevents the coyote from throwing the grenade out at the bird before it explodes. Dazed, Wile peeks out to inspect the cause, and the manhole cover, and then the boulder, land on his head. 5. Soon afterwards, Wile E. Coyote dresses as an attractive, blond hitch hiker holding a sign that says ""Old Virginia or Bust"" in an attempt to lure the Road Runner, but the clever bird speeds right past him and uncovers the Coyote. The Road Runner returns with Wile E's wig, holding up a sign saying ""I'VE ALREADY GOT A DATE"". 6. Using deception, the coyote paints a realistic picture of a bridge and places it at the end of a road where there is no bridge, just the end of the road, as displayed by a sign that the coyote turns around to make the facade convincing. Maybe a bit too convincing, though: the Road Runner runs through the trick picture as if it was a real road. As the coyote looks on, puzzled, he fails to see a truck emerging through the road in the painting, which promptly runs him over. Frustrated, the coyote tears through the painting and then falls to the ground, leaving dust in the air in the word ""OH NO!"". 7. Looking to smash the Road Runner, Wile heaves a large boulder onto the winding mountain roads which the Road Runner is traveling. Eventually, the Road Runner and the boulder approach the same area, but the Road Runner slips just out of the way, while the boulder is pitched into the air, up a serac, and onto a new set of roads. The coyote is out peeking at the roads, hoping to see the Road Runner crushed, but instead he is about to suffer the same fate. The boulder is approaching from behind, and Wile sees it coming but cannot escape fast enough. 8. The coyote, hoping for technology to triumph, uses various ACME devices put together  to create a makeshift air balloon. Floating in the clouds, he sees the Road Runner and releases the anvil, causing the balloon to rise in the air until it stops. At this point, the string keeping it blown up unfurls, sending it flying through the air until it runs out of air. Then, he falls to and into the earth, followed by the anvil falling on his head and the Road Runner passing over him just to embarrass him even further. 9. Finally, at the end of the cartoon, the coyote, listening out for the Road Runner's beeping, drops from a high log and lunges towards the bird with a javelin, only to realise that the beeping came from a nearby truck, which the Coyote dives straight into, and is thus whacked into the air and wound around the log. The camera cuts to the truck to show that the Road Runner is driving. The End. The title is a pun on ""Going! Going! Gone!"""
10131206	/m/02q2t1p	Zipping Along	1953-09-19			"{""/m/02h40lc"": ""English Language""}"	"{""/m/09c7w0"": ""United States of America""}"	"{""/m/02hmvc"": ""Short Film"", ""/m/0hqxf"": ""Family Film"", ""/m/01z4y"": ""Comedy"", ""/m/0hcr"": ""Animation""}"	"Introduction: The Road Runner is ""zipping along"" by a train, and the camera zooms in and then freezes for his ""Latin"" name: Velocitus Tremenjus. When the cartoon restarts, the Road Runner leaves the train and runs onto the main roads, with the coyote watching from above. He glances from side to side, and the camera freezes for Wile E. Coyote  halfway through his head turning. True to this name, he ventures down the mountain and toward the road, waiting for the familiar Beep-beep sound; when this reaches his ears, he jumps into a 4-way intersection, but the Road Runner mows him down from behind. When the seething coyote stands up, facing the opposite direction, he is flattened from the other side, and then eventually from all four directions. The camera cuts to Wile E., who looks increasingly annoyed as this sequence repeats over and over until the camera cuts away. 1. Lying in wait behind a rock with a hand grenade, the coyote mistakenly chews off the grenade and throws the stop at the Road Runner, and once Wile E. realizes the gaffe, the explosion hits. 2. Wile E. now inspects the roads from a high overlook and peers out to see that the Road Runner has disappeared temporarily. That ends when the bird pops up behind Wile E. and beeps, then dashes away, leaving a lifesize cloud of dust behind that also beeps at the coyote. He reclines on the rail, miffed at the turn of events. 3. As the cartoon returns to the regular desert scenery, Wile E. gingerly drops a bunch of mousetraps onto the road, but when the Road Runner zooms past, instead of getting trapped in them, the traps drop onto Wile in his trench hideout. The coyote's reaction is delayed briefly before he yelps in pain. 4. Resorting now to ACME products, these being a kite kit and bomb, Wile E. leaps in the air several times in an attempt to go airborne, but soon runs off the edge of the cliff he is on, and he falls to the ground and his own bomb explodes on him. 5. The Road Runner is zipping along some roads while Wile E. is chopping down a power pole. Wile E. confirms the path of the Road Runner and finishes chopping, but he is too late. When the power pole that Wile E. chopped traverses the road, all of the other poles fall as well due to the power lines pulling them down. The one directly to the left lands directly on Wile and knocks him into the ground. 6. Living up to the Wile part of his name, Wile E. offers bird seed mixed with steel shot to the Road Runner, who stops his road-burning and has a quick snack. Wile E. jumps out behind the bird as he speeds away with a giant magnet, but lucky only he could be, a big TNT canister is attracted to the magnet and another explosion results, twisting the magnet into a pretzel and knocking Wile E. back through a rock face. 7. Delving deeper into wily trickery, the coyote learns hypnotism from a book to induce the Road Runner to jump off a cliff. He tests the method successfully on a small bug by projecting a static lightning from his hands. However, when he jumps out and tries to hit the Road Runner with it, the bird is wise to this, holding a mirror that causes the lightning to be reflected back to Wile E. who, in only succeeding in hypnotising himself, obligingly walks off the cliff. 8. The Road Runner taunts his opponent from above, and the coyote attempts to use a seesaw and rock contraption, but the rock simply falls directly back on its owner. 9. Now, Wile E. sets a gun trap for the Road Runner, with himself ready to activate the guns at a moment's notice. He hides behind a turn as the Road Runner runs into the trap. However, because of the force he applied to the strings, the guns are pulled into the crosshairs of the coyote when they are activated, and he ends up shooting himself. 10. The coyote now hides behind a rock as he waits for the Road Runner to speed across a treacherous suspension bridge. As the Road Runner crosses, Wile E. jumps out and cuts the ropes, but instead of causing the bridge to fall, the whole plateau that Wile E. inhabits falls down. The Road Runner brakes at the end of the bridge and continues his rampage. 11. Wile E. waits for the Road Runner to pass and then loads himself into a ""human cannonball"" cannon, which unfortunately recoils and is thrown backwards, leaving the coyote blackened. 12. The coyote is now on top of a rectangular board bridging a deep canyon with a large wrecking ball at his command. He drops the ball into a circular path, which would have hit the Road Runner if the bird hadn't stopped and waited. The ball continues its circle and ends up right back where it started - on top of the coyote. 13. One last time, the coyote attempts to ensnare his nemesis. He mines a canyon with myriad explosives behind a doorway with many ""FREE BIRD SEED"" declarations and connects the main controller to the door. Unfortunately, as soon as the coyote climbs over the wall, he encounters a gigantic truck. With no recourse, Wile E. opens the door and is blown up repeatedly, then run over by the truck. Wile E. sticks out his tongue and beeps in an imitation of the Road Runner, and then falls unconscious."

Wile E., after recovering, blinks his eyes and visualizes a wonderful Road Runner feast. Seeing no need for a comparatively tawdry can, he chases the Road Runner. Wile's low stance reduces his drag and allows him to approach the Road Runner until the bird rockets away. The coyote's eyes pop out of his sockets and he is left dejectedly planning his next scheme. 1. First, the coyote uses a pulley, rope and rock trap to smash the passing Road Runner, evidently hoping the extra complexity will stop himself from being squashed instead. No dice; Wile E. is squashed by the rock as the Road Runner stops and mocks him. 2. The clearly angry coyote, with a lasso in the road, listens for the Road Runner, but a truck trips the lasso first, dragging the coyote across the hard ground. Wile E. is left with a bare rear end from friction as he paces off the road. 3. The coyote builds a Burmese tiger trap according to a How-To book: dig a square hole in the road and fill it with a sheet camouflaged as road. He hides behind a rock and, hearing the Road Runner beep and the trap activate, dives in to capture his prey...but instead, he gets throttled by a real Burmese tiger , which stealthily climbs out of the trap. 4. The camera displays a road with a pop-up grate intended to block the Road Runner; Wile tests its crank control successfully, but it fails to deploy against the speeding Road Runner. The coyote unsuccessfully tries numerous methods of unspringing the grate, then resumes the chase in outrage and is soon stopped by a railroad crossing. The Road Runner taunts his nemesis as he slowly prances the tracks, and the coyote is lifted into the air by the striped divider. After falling back down, Wile E. chases the Road Runner down the tracks, which run through mountains. The two pass by opposite lanes and the Road Runner signals the coyote, who stops cold after a few seconds and turns back, and after again running past the bird, he reverses only to find the Road Runner has escaped to a lower track. When he finally pursues the bird across the correct track, Wile is stopped by a train, and dashes in and out of a rockface; he sees the train proceed across an inferior track, and sighs with relief until a second train approaches from inside the rock. The apoplectic coyote holds up a circular STOP IN THE NAME OF HUMANITY sign, but since Wile E. isn't human, nothing happens except for the crash. 5. Next, Wile E. digs a corrugated culvert intending to mine the road with TNT, but the wires are short enough that he pulls the detonator over, which squeezes onto a loose rock and explodes the TNT while Wile inhabits the culvert. 6. The Coyote starts a speed motorcycle in pursuit of a passing Road Runner, but simply slams into a tree and is then jiggled around by the intense engine vibrations. 7. Now, Wile E. baits a white circle in the middle of a wide suspension bridge with bird seed, then hides underneath the bridge to cut out the circle as the Road Runner feasts. Instead, Wile falls along with the entirety of the bridge except for the bird and circle left floating in midair. 8. Finally, the Coyote attempts to outrun his rival by ingesting ACME Triple-Strength Fortified Leg Muscle Vitamins. He burns rubber on the road and dashes off, leaving the highway aflame. The Road Runner watches his foe approach and, from a standing start with a tongue-flapping beep, matches that speed instantly with about a one-second lead. This warp-speed chase continues, with the Coyote getting as close as a half-second at a valley and the Road Runner gaining distance on uphill grades, until they pass by the cranked-up grate, which finally rises for only Wile E. to smash into. The bird brakes and views his hapless rival before burning more rubber on the road, spelling out ""That's all, folks"" in smoke. The End."

Meanwhile, Wile E. Coyote  emerges from his hibernation and is soon fully awoken by a Beep-beep. He peeks over the plateau to see the Road Runner at the bottom and strides down the vertical edge with eating utensils, in pursuit of breakfast. The Road Runner taunts his nemesis by dodging at the last possible moment, allowing the coyote to slam into the rock floor. The chase moves to the real roads, and the Road Runner taunts him with a Beep-beep before blasting into Mach 187, disappearing beyond the 10 mile horizon in only 6 frames of film, causing Wile E.'s entire jaw to hang open and then drop out as he enters a cloud. The coyote trails dust as he reclines on a low rock to dream his next plan. 1. Wile E. covers an entire section of a canyon with glue, making sure to leave space for himself to stand. However, the approaching Beep-beep belongs to a truck and not the Road Runner, and thus the coyote lacks sufficient time to escape the glue; he tries anyway and cannot leap far enough before he gets stuck, and can only watch as he is flattened. Wile E. thus tries another method: covering a low rockface with glue and preparing, from a distance, to throw dynamite at the Road Runner. However, the bird's velocity causes the glue to part sideways, drowning Wile E. in his hiding place and preventing him from throwing the dynamite. After failing at this and at blowing out the fuse, he begins walking with his hips  in an effort to allow the wind to snuff or slow the burning fuse, then jumps into a nearby river; however, the explosive detonates about three feet above, and the coyote pauses in midair before he falls into the water. 2. A detour sign points through a hollow log, and the Road Runner ""falls"" for the trap by dashing in at full speed. The camera zooms out to show that the exit leads only to air, but does not show the Road Runner; it then cuts to him perched on the very edge of the log. Wile E. is puzzled and climbs into the log; the bird beeps and exits out a hole in the top, and the coyote peeks out after him, but his weight causes the log to tip over the cliff. 3. Now, the coyote hopes to flatten the bird with a 10,000-lb weight supported by a pair of pulleys. However, the weight doesn't drop when the coyote lets go of the rope, only falling on the coyote when he resumes the chase. Wile E. strolls into view postured like a walking barchair. 4. Seeing the Road Runner approach his cliff lair, Wile E. lights a sequence of fireworks attached to a lasso, but the Road Runner is actually running down a different cliff, and the coyote inertially spins the lasso until the hissing fireworks explode. 5. Next, Wile E. loads himself into a slingshot and retreats for maximum velocity, until he backs into a beeping Road Runner; the slingshot fires before he can grab the bird, and the coyote flies 2 feet above the ground, into a tunnel, and is squashed into a passing truck's grille. 6. Wile E. uses an outboard motor, a jim-dandy wagon, a wash tub, water, and roller skates to create a hydropowered wagon that will hopefully lead him on his quest. He soon passes a DANGER BRIDGE OUT sign and cannot stop the wagon from running off the bridge; he unties himself from the wagon as it rolls into thin air, but sees the rope dropping to the river below and, worst of all, the wagon arriving safely at the other end of the bridge! The coyote funereally waves at the camera before he plummets into the river. 7. Wile E. observes the Road Runner's trajectory across the mountain and ignites a rocket aimed at a particular location. The camera cuts to both the rocket and the Road Runner chicken-style until the rocket hits its target location, but just after his enemy. The rocket continues down through the mountain and out of a mine before giving up the ghost. Wile E. sighs with relief - and then the rocket explodes. 8. The coyote uses a female Road Runner costume to attract his counterpart, but  only attracts a rout of coyotes who chase him down the road like the scenes of Tom and Jerry's The Brothers Carry-Mouse-Off as the real Road Runner pulls into view with ""THE END"" sign. The End."

Coyote is cooking some food in a tin bucket over a fire. He adds pepper and a drop of a brown liquid, and stirs the bucket and fishes out what is revealed to be a tin can. The Coyote then sits down on a rock and prepares to cut the can in half  before he realizes what he is eating, and then pushes the entire table setting off the rock table. ""COYOTE - Eatibus Almost Anythingus"". With a Beep-beep, the Roadrunner speeds by and throws the coyote rolling across the ground. The camera cuts to the Road Runner, who is currently a blur of motion, and freezes the clip temporarily to add his fictitious Latin name ""Velocitus Delectiblus"". Wile licks his lips, then dashes after his nemesis. The Road Runner taunts Wile E. with a Beep-beep before blasting into Mach 225, disappearing beyond the 10 mile horizon in only 5 frames of film, dusting up all the roads in the distance. Wile stops in mid-stride and points at the bird saying ""Did you see that?"", then thinks of his new plan. 1. The Coyote attaches a pointed blade to the end of his nose and plunges himself off a bow at the passing Road Runner, but instead spears through the trunk of a saguaro, which breaks out of the ground and falls over a cliff. 2. Wile then loads himself into a slingshot and cuts the string as the Road Runner dashes ahead of him, but nothing happens. He ducks out of the slingshot and puts his head into it to peer at the ""faulty"" string, but then it activates and pitches the Coyote onto the stone ground 10 feet away. 3. The Coyote lies in wait for the Road Runner to come around a turn and lights a cannon fuse, but instead of firing the cannonball, the entire cannon, with Wile on board, is fired backwards into a mountain wall. When Wile steps out of the cannon, it fires another ball into his face. 4. He then attempts to use a stone ""wrecking ball"" attached to a tree to hit the Roadrunner, but instead hits the trunk of the tree, which hammers him into the rock he is standing on. 5. Next, Wile simply rolls the ball down a hill out into the road, but it pitches up a stone serac and right back on top of its owner. 6. Wile covers a narrow canyon floor with Acme GREASE, but once again, a truck just happens to be approaching. He tries to run across the grease, but fails and is run over. The Road Runner easily glides over it, so he attempts to follow. However, each attempt moves him forward a negligible amount of distance until he finally collapses in the grease. 7. The Road Runner is then seen zipping to one end of a cliff and beeping at the Coyote on the other end, who attempts to swing over the canyon but only smacks into a plateau just underneath him. 8. Wile leaves out bird seed while he climbs to the top of the cliff and prepares his trap. The Road Runner zips up and munches down, while the Coyote lowers a dynamite stick on the end of a fishing line. Instead of blowing up the Road Runner, the flame travels up the line and back to the TNT box, which explodes on the Coyote. 9. He then creates a tar-and-feather machine based on his readings of How To Tar And Feather A Road Runner: 10th printing, and successfully tests it on a small cactus. Wile hides in a thin crevice with the machine pointed towards the road that the Road Runner traverses. Unfortunately, the emitters spin around and attack their owner, and the Roadrunner, as if it were the simplest thing in the world , holds up a sign saying: ROAD-RUNNERS ALREADY HAVE FEATHERS! 10. Wile prepares one final trap: a dynamite pit in the road. Just after he lights the fuse, the Road Runner stops short of him and beeps in his face, provoking a short chase that ends when he runs directly over his own exploding pit. Dejected, the charred Coyote walks off-camera and returns with a stand-up sign that says: Wanted: One gullible Coyote. Apply to manager of this theater. Then he goes back and returns with the Looney Tunes ""That's all folks!"" end-title card. The End. The title is a pun on ""Guided Missile"". That was one of the few Road Runner Cartoons that does not make use of the declining slide whistle used for the Coyote, when he falls down a cliff, or when he leaps up into the air and comes down, due to the scariness of the surprising beeping Road Runner, or when a boulder, or a bomb falls on the Coyote."

Coyote, apparently famished, wads up a bunch of mud to make a lookalike chicken. He roasts it in an adobe oven, then sits down to ""eat"" it, with less than perfect results . So he makes a second fixture - a trash can - and throws the ""chicken"" in it, proving he is indeed Famishius Fantasticus. The Road Runner  bowls everything over, starting the chase. Wile E. takes a straight-line shortcut instead of the road to catch up. Before Wile E. can come close, however, the Road Runner sets the road on fire with his blinding speed, causing Wile E. to burn his feet. He stomps out the fire on his paws, but finds his tail is also burning. Wile E., thinking fast, witches for water to cool his tail off. The Coyote rages at the camera, but nothing can be done except plan the next scheme. 1. Wile E. uses his frequent idea: swing from a high place armed with a javelin, looking to spear the Road Runner. This time, he simply plows into the ground as the Road Runner calmly passes on the right. 2. The Coyote stuffs a gun on a spring into a ground compartment and locks it with a safety lock, hoping to shoot his enemy, but due to the excessive spring force, the gun does a 180 and ends up on the opposite side of the Coyote, upside down, but pointed in his face. Wile E. can only plug the barrel with a finger before getting blasted in the face. Then, the gun returns to the hole in the ground, pulling its owner with it. 3. Wile E. attaches himself to a tree catapult to throw himself towards a passing Road Runner, but instead he bounces himself on the ground and suffers repeating back and forth faceplants as the tree continually stretches to either side. 4. To block the Road Runner, the Coyote attaches a bunch of maces to a string and pole, and unwinds the string when he hears the bird approaching. It's an effective obstacle, and would have stopped the Road Runner except that the pole lifts itself out of the ground and drops on the hiding Coyote before the Road Runner passes. Wile E. is battered and tied up by the end of the fracas. 5. This time, the Coyote uses deception. He posts a detour and bridges a crevasse with a ladder that he has sabotaged with a cut in the structure, which will make it collapse if passed over. He hears the Road Runner, but doesn't see him, and he looks up to see the Road Runner safely perched on top of a high cliff, watching his every move. The angry Coyote uses his own broken ladder to climb up to the top, with predictably disastrous results. Wile E. falls into the canyon, grabs onto the second section of the ladder to alleviate the fall, and he continues into the ground and through each rung on the way down. 6. Now, Wile E. loads a circle of explosives into the center of a tire, and rolls the tire down a hill to meet the Road Runner. Unfortunately, the explosives stay behind and blow up their user. 7. The Coyote is loaded into a massive missile to chase the Road Runner, but when he sets it off, instead of launching the missile, he only launches himself out of it and through a rock face. He emerges from the resulting hole, blackened. 8. The final gag in this cartoon involves a pack of rocks from on high, ready to fall on the Road Runner when the trap door opens. But when Wile E. opens the trap door, no rocks fall because they're too densely packed. So, the Coyote first runs to the top and stomps on them , then procures a long, thin stick and uses it like an ice pick to force them out while standing under them. Pebbles, then stones, then rocks fall. Wile E. finally comes to his senses and raises a sign: ""IN HEAVEN'S NAME - WHAT AM I DOING?"" Too late; Wile E. raises an umbrella to prepare for the resulting impact of huge rocks, and after the impact, a long lump forms on the Coyote's head with a white flag making the lump look like a flagpole. The flag reads ""THE END"" while it waves in the wind, accompanied by the song: ""Taps"". The End."

Coyote  and the Road Runner  are continuing their chase through the twisty roads of the desert. As Wile E. closes in on the Road Runner, a 4-way intersection is reached and the Road Runner takes a left turn. Wile E. looks back as he brakes himself into the dirt, not noticing a ""DANGER BRIDGE OUT"" sign, and thus falls off the edge of the plateau and busts a hole in the roads below. The Coyote walks out of the hole and plans his next scheme. 1. Thinking simple, the Coyote attempts to simply trip the Road Runner with a fake coyote foot , but only ends up getting the fake foot winded. As he walks out, he kneels on the leg and scratches his head, only for the leg to unreel itself, twisting his body in turn. 2. Wile E. broods in the dirt, and soon comes up with a new plan: Throw out a dynamite stick with a string. However, when Wile E. circles the string over his head, it lassos itself around the coyote's face before exploding. 3. Going for speed again, the Coyote then builds a contraption made from a fan, a sail, and roller skates to propel himself down the road. This works excellent in a straight line, but cannot follow the Road Runner around a tight curve. The poor Coyote is thrown into a pool, digs through a dirt beach, and slams directly into a wall. 4. Next, Wile E. holds onto a large firework and lights it as the Road Runner passes, hoping to give semi-aerial chase. However, the firework takes off without its owner, flaying the coyote's chest in the process, and then it hits a curve and reverses itself, also flaying Wile's pate and deeply annoying the devious coyote. 5. Devious doesn't apply to the next simple trap: Wile E. tries to pull a large boulder onto one end of a see-saw to launch himself towards the Road Runner on a high cliff, but the boulder squashes him instead. 6. Wile E. pushes an anvil tied to a balloon off an outcropping, and then pulls the string when he hears the Road Runner, trying to flatten his nemesis. The anvil and the Road Runner converge towards the same spot in the bridge the Road Runner is now on, but the Road Runner brakes just in time to avoid it. The anvil smashes through the bridge, is thrown back up through the hole by a power line, and drops towards the Coyote who is perched on the very edge of the outcropping. Shivering with fear, Wile E. covers his head, preparing for the impact. The anvil misses him, but instead breaks through another part of the outcropping. The Coyote sighs with relief, but soon spots he is defying gravity and is then subject to it! 7. Again attempting to give semi-aerial chase, the Coyote retracts a massive spring attached to a wall and sits in it, tentatively letting go of his grip on the ground as the Road Runner passes on the left. But instead of launching at the bird, he simply gets caught inside the spring as it extends itself outwards. 8. Another ACME product  takes the scene. Wile E. picks up one of them, hydrates it, and attempts to throw it off the cliff towards the Road Runner below, but instead, the boulder expands first and crushes him. 9. In a final attempt to outrun and flatten the Road Runner, the Coyote constructs an outboard steam roller. When he turns it on, it rolls away from him and down the road. The steam roller soon encounters the Road Runner, who reverses direction and runs away. Wile E. continues to chase after his creation, while in what appears to be a convenient Deus ex machina, a fork comes up ahead with a sign stating: In case of steam roller use Detour. The Road Runner takes the detour and zooms into a miniature ""escape tunnel"", which was actually a cannon trap, with the coyote in hot pursuit. Wile E. leaps behind the cannon, lights the fuse and sits down, tired but satisfied. The fuse smokes, but the cannon doesn't fire. Confused, Wile E. looks inside the cannon and sees a white light coming out, accompanied by railroad signs. Seeing no danger, he laughs and looks inside again, but the cannon fires, with the Road Runner riding on top of the cannonball. The Road Runner waves at the now injured Coyote as he walks away, only for his own steamroller to come rolling towards him. Wile E. holds up a sign saying: ""This is the end"" just as the steamroller flattens him. The End."

From here, the Road Runner speeds off, leaving the coyote to fall on the ground. Wile recovers quickly, kicks up some dust, and begins to chase the Road Runner; the bird, though, leaves so much dust in the road that his pursuer cannot see ahead. Eventually, except for his ears, the coyote is completely enclosed in the dust. The Road Runner pulls next to the coyote and beeps, alerting Wile to his surroundings. The coyote's expression becomes foreboding, and the camera cuts out to show both apparently suspended in midair. As the dust clears, the coyote pokes his hands through the bottom of the cloud, and then looks down to see nothing but air below him. The dust completely clears, showing that the Road Runner is perched on the edge of a cliff and the coyote on the wrong side of him, and gravity then turns on. Determined not to let this happen again, Wile climbs up a very high escarpment and surveys his surroundings for the Road Runner...who happens to have pulled up right behind him and now beeps such that the coyote falls back down. The camera zooms in on an obviously miffed Wile as he falls to the ground again. Dusting himself off, the coyote gets up and walks out onto the road until the Road Runner beeps a second time and sends his rival directly into a low-slung rock plateau. 1. As he hasn't studied it enough, Wile follows the instructions of THE ART OF ROAD-RUNNER TRAPPING: # Dig hole in road # Camouflage hole # Wait patiently # Eat Road Runner However, he never gets past the first step, as his jackhammer vibrates enough to pull the coyote into the hole. When the power cord stretches enough to unplug the jackhammer, the coyote climbs out and finds himself vibrating sporadically. Wile walks over to the book and prepares to tear it in half, but another vibration does the job for him. 2. Still trying to halt the Road Runner, Wile builds a brick wall on the mountain roads and waits. Soon, he hears the Road Runner braking in front of the wall. When his ears recover from the sonic assault and the dust cloud settles, he quizzically looks around the corner of the wall to see his own rear end. Wile makes random movements, imitated by his rear, while looking behind and ahead of him, and finally determines that this is a duplicate of himself and rolls dynamite under his own rear. The firework promptly explodes, and Wile laughs until he realizes his own tail is aflame; he leaps directly into the air in pain and falls down to the ground. 3. Wile E., knowing about the ""birds and the bees"", leaves out bird seed while he prepares to release a fifth of Acme bumblebees from a distance. When Wile pulls the lid off, instead of attacking the munching Road Runner next to them, the swarm flies 400 feet in the distance towards the coyote and repeatedly stings him. 4. Wile now prepares a second bird seed trap, this time hoping to squash the bird with an anvil. Of course, when Wile walks onto the board to drop the anvil, the wood snaps under the combined weight and the anvil falls towards the Road Runner, who simply steps to the side out of danger. The board halves fall on top of the resulting crater to create a convenient bridge back to the feast. 5. Having had enough of the simple traps, Wile builds a lengthy steep ramp and lights a bomb intended for the Road Runner at the ramp's bottom, but which simply explodes instantly upon lighting  6. The coyote now prepares a giant catapult in the road; however, the boulder is too heavy for the catapult to sling at the passing Road Runner and flattens its owner. 7. Finally, Wile hopes to shoot the Road Runner with a harpoon gun. The rope, however, catches one of the coyote's feet and drags his rear over a cactus and under several rocks, then hurtles him into open space. Wile sees the fix he is in and recovers in time to grab the very end of the rope. Unfortunately, the rope continues into a very thin pipe, then out onto the road and directly into a chicken race with a truck. Wile smashes directly through the truck, and then the spear finally impales a rock face, but this leads to the coyote being swung down into the path of a train and bumped all the way up to the edge of a precipice, ragged, exhausted, gasping and sobbing. The Road Runner pulls up directly behind him, but instead of beeping, which would possibly drive his opponent insane , the Road Runner shows a soft side by holding up a sign saying: ""I just don't have the heart."" As he dashes back the way he came, the sign changes to ""'Bye!"" The End. The title is a pun on the title ""Room and Board""."

The Road Runner stops and steps aside. The Coyote passes him and stops in a cloud of dust. The Road Runner then zips into the distance with the force lifting the ribbon of pavement off the ground in his wake. Wile E. lowers his expectations  and thinks of a new scheme. The gags are as follows: 1. The Coyote, on a cliff, drops a washtub on the Road Runner on the road below, jumps on it and puts a stick of dynamite underneath it. The Road Runner zips up to him. The Coyote goes under the washtub to investigate why the bird isn't there and the dynamite blows up, encasing the Coyote in a tube made from the washtub. 2. The Coyote hides around a corner to bash the Road Runner with a sledgehammer. But the hammer falls off and the stick bashes the Coyote and chases him into the distance. 3. Birdseed is place on some railroad tracks but a train runs down the Coyote before he can get off the railroad. 4. Attached to a green balloon, the Coyote carrying a harpoon jumps off a cliff, tied to a rope. He misses the Road Runner, but the force carries him into a storm cloud. The harpoon attracts lightning which zaps the Coyote . 5. A bundle of dynamite is unrolled from its wires toward a short underpass beneath the road. But thick rolled up wires that have just been unrolled tend to have memory, so the bundle starts to move, then rolls back up to the Coyote's hiding spot before he gets back there and notices, and one push of the plunger blows him up. 6. Using a rope and a pulley, the Coyote raises a baby grand piano high above the road. As the Road Runner passes, the Coyote lets go of the rope, which sticks in the pulley. The Coyote jumps on top of the piano, which loosens the rope and causes the piano - and the Coyote - to drop to the ground. Dazed, the Coyote opens his mouth to reveal that the piano keys are now his teeth; he plays ""Taps"" on them briefly before passing out. 7. An elaborate Rube Goldberg-type gag ends the cartoon. The Coyote uses a tiny slingshot to knock loose a stick holding up a watering can suspended on a wooden yardarm. The can tips and water pours onto a plant which has a wooden match attached to it. The plant grows and the match strikes against a rock and lights a stick of dynamite. On top of the dynamite is a boot with a brick in it. The blast sends the boot ontop of a teeter board, which rises and releases a mouse in a cage at the other end. The mouse runs to grab a piece of cheese on a scale. A weight on the other end of the scale falls, pulling the trigger on a rifle attached to a cliff. A bullet from the rifle ricochets off two metal bullseyes and knocks down an upright cannon. The wick on the cannon is lit by a nearby candle, which fires a ball that goes through two funnels and plummets on top of the unsuspecting coyote. After the coyote is bashed into the ground, 'The End' appears on the cannon ball. The title is a pun on the title Hook, Line and Sinker."

Coyote, labeled ""Eatius-slobbius"" . Eventually, the chase leads to a 3-way Y fork, leaving the coyote confused as to which way his enemy went. The bird answers for him by pulling up behind him and beeping, giving the coyote a real headache on the rocks above. However, before he can chase the Road Runner in that direction, the bird pulls behind him a second time. Wile instantly suspects the situation, and peeks through his legs, but this only leads to him bumping his head on the ground when the Road Runner beeps. The chase now begins in full force, ending when the Road Runner barely escapes the coyote's grip and sets a bridge on fire due to his speed. Wile does his best to slow down when he sees the upcoming hole left in it, but fails and falls down to the ground. After hitting the ground, Wile E. comes up with an idea or 2 on how to catch the Road Runner: 1. While the Road Runner is munching on desert plants, his opponent attempts to drop a hand grenade on him. However, the grenade, by pure misfortune, drops onto a power line and is hoisted directly back to its owner, instantly wiping the laugh off his face. The grenade explodes, and the coyote lets go of the stop perforce. This, however, causes a second grenade to be thrown up to Wile and explode on him as well. Later on, Wile paces the cliff he's still on and it isn't until he stops near the edge that he comes up with a new plan. 2.

Hoping to ambush the Road Runner, Wile E. loads a firework into a slingshot and prepares to fire it at the Road Runner, but it explodes on him first. 4. Having mined the road with a giant firework, the coyote has logistical problems with the match. His first attempts has the match burn his face. Finally he is ""gratefully"" helped out by the Road Runner, who gives the coyote a lit match. As soon as Wile lights the fuse, the Road Runner disappears, causing the coyote to chase after him. The Road Runner then stops next to the firework, signals for the coyote to stop, and points at the sizzling firework before he dodges the explosion, leaving Wile to take the entire blast. 5. To hopefully squash the Road Runner, the coyote flips a rock across a high outcropping, rather predictably leading to the entire outcropping breaking off. Wile continues to flip the rock over, and it is only when the rock ends up in the air above him that he realizes what is happening. He runs through the air to avoid being squashed directly by the rock, and the piece of outcropping lands on a rock to create a see-saw. Wile E. lands on the right end, while the rock smashes onto the left end and sends the coyote up into a rockface, then down onto the see-saw again before he flips the rock onto himself. 6. With his own special steamboat, it looks good for Wile E. Coyote, tearing apart the river as he attempts to catch the Road Runner on the riverbank. However, when he climbs out to attempt to grab his opponent, he sees that he is going over a waterfall and only barely steers himself back in the other direction. With relief, the coyote relaxes until he ends up falling off a second waterfall in the opposite direction! 7. With stealth exhausted, the coyote tries to use raw speed to catch the Road Runner and tests his new high-speed tonic  on an unsuspecting mouse. The mouse rattles around as a ""warm-up"", then darts across the desert at an impossible speed, and runs up and down a rock arch to return to his tester. Happy with this development, Wile E. releases the mouse, still suffering the effects of RPM, into his hole, and then drinks the entire bottle of it himself. After the warm-up period, Wile begins the chase and quickly begins to erase the Road Runner's considerable head start. However, just as it is getting down to the wire, the Road Runner sidesteps and trips the coyote, making him roll out of control into a construction zone and then into a dynamite shed, along with a kerosene lamp, which explodes everything inside. The small silo top is transformed into a rocket, which is fired into the sky along with its rider and explodes, creating fireworks in the starry night sky, much to Road Runner's amusement."

E. Coyote  attempts several ways to get the Roadrunner . The Roadrunner reaches two outcroppings. When Wile E. tries it, the end of said outcropping comes off. Just when he thought he was going to suffer gravity yet again, Wile. E was saved by a tree branch. He tries to go on the plateau nearby, only for the plateau to fall to a river. A fish nearby is spooked when Wile E. gets his newest scheme. 1. The Coyote races after the Roadrunner with his new roller skates. When the Roadrunner tries to trip the Coyote, Wile E., in time, leaps in the air and sticks his tongue out at the Roadrunner. Little does he know, he is about to fall of a cliff yet again! He ends up in the ground, with only his feet sticking out, as the wheels fall off one of the skates. 2. After getting an explosive camera kit, Wile E. prepares for his newest deception. The Roadrunner is intrigued by the signs. When the Roadrunner got ready for his picture, the gun goes off on the Coyote. As the Roadrunner speeds away, Wile E. sees the one flaw of his attempt: he forgot to take off the lens cap that was on the entire time. 3. As the Roadrunner taunts the Coyote from above, Wile E. prepares a trampoline. However, when he jumps, he gets trapped inside like a burlap sack. 4. Now armed with a crossbow and dynamite, Wile E. prepares for his plan. However, when he lights the fuse and the Roadrunner comes, the crossbow fires yet the dynamite is left behind. 5. Now resorting to his best friend Acme, Wile E. receives a jet propelled pogo stick. However, when the Coyote prepares the pogo stick, it propels him to the cliff behind him. Down he goes again. 6. Using railroad deception again, Wile E. hammers a crossing sign, accompanied by Hi-Fi Railroad Crossing Sounds and tracks set up. When the Roadrunner stops, the Coyote tries to catch the bird, only to be run over by an actual train. 7. Having almost blowing his top with simple traps, Wile E. uses 12 bombs down an extremely long slide. He lifts the slide door to release the bombs from their bin, but none of them come out. He tries shaking the bin moderately, then violently. He douses the fuses to try to get them to go out, but when he tries to stomp on them, Boom! A dazed Wile E. slides down. The Roadrunner passes over him to add insult to injury. 8. Wile E. receives another of Acme's products, a jet propelled unicycle. When the Coyote lights the fuse, he is dragged away. Wile E. tries to balance himself and succeeds. When he passes the Roadrunner, he tries to get him, but didn't move when he seemed to speed off. Wile E. falls down off a cliff and the resulting cloud of smoke has the words The End on it.

The rock displays the title, and when it falls to the ground and barely misses, the credits are shown in the dust. Director Chuck Jones' credit is displayed upon a rocket that the coyote plans to ride. The rocket is paused in mid-flight to show the coyote's Latin name: Hardheadipus Oedipus. The Road Runner is still leading the way, and his flight is paused to show his Latin name: Bat-outta-hell-ius. The chase goes well for Wile E., until the rocket slams into a low plateau. Luckily enough, the coyote still can continue the air chase. He almost catches the Road Runner, but slams his head on a rock arch before he can pounce. Wile E., looking like a sunflower, looks at the camera and then trudges off. 1. Hoping for better luck this time, Wile E. takes delivery of an ACME giant elastic rubber band and attempts to launch himself off a slingshot, but only succeeds in going about 2 feet before face planting. The coyote poses innocently on a rock perch until the Road Runner passes by below, and soon comes up with his next plan. 2. Again hoping for a big smash, he flips a clam-shaped rock across a thin outcropping, but when Wile E. finally pushes it over the edge, it flips over and the end attaches itself to the precipice. Wile E. attempts to push it down, and then stomps on and off it six times, with no result. Then, he jumps fully on and puts his whole might onto the rock, and succeeds. He continues to stomp on the rock until he realizes he's falling. He looks down and sees the ground, then attempts to jump off the rock. However, all that does is turn the rock in circles. Not giving up, Wile E. thus manages to slow the rock down, but the end result is the rock drilling through a large rock face and into a train tunnel, where the coyote is hit and thrown all the way back out. A small piece of the rock plants him on the ground neatly, and a relieved Wile E. steps off, but finds himself continuing to rotate periodically like the McKimson-created character Tasmanian Devil as he walks. 3. The camera shows an order form for an extremely large railroad construction job that Wile E. has done to attempt to ensnare his nemesis. Now, the camera zooms across the landscape to show the extremely long railroad, and that the coyote has put himself into a rocket sled to glide across the tracks. The first turn is going from almost straight down to about 60 degrees downwards; however, the sled breaks directly through the mounted railroad and face plants on the ground. 4. Since physics never works for the coyote, he uses it as a weapon by baiting the Road Runner's bird seed with iron pellets and mounting a bomb and a magnet on an old-fashioned clamp-on roller skate; however, the magnetic force is strong enough to separate the skate into two pieces, leaving the bomb close to the coyote. A puzzled Wile E. pokes his head up from his hiding place and is obliterated by the bomb. 5. Not having learned from the last physics outing, Wile E. drops a bowling ball through a pipe section, trying to squash his rival. It misses the Road Runner, and the ball's weight causes it to bounce straight back up through the pipe and hit its owner in the face. Wile E. is thrown up into the air, and down through the pipe and onto the ground, followed by the bowling ball to add insult to injury. 6. With all the forces of nature against him, the coyote plugs himself into an ACME Indestructo Steel Ball to avoid them, and rolls himself off an escarpment. However, he narrowly misses his intended target  and pitches himself onto a serac and into a dam. He rolls himself up out of the water, and then directly down a wall, over several rocks, and then back into the water. Wile E. finally pokes out of the ball to realize where he is going: off the edge again. He falls directly down the waterfall, into a mash of water, and finally out of the dam, but instead onto an old enemy: railroad tracks. He gets out, relieved, but soon gets back inside for shelter when he sees an approaching train, which hits the ball and sends it directly into an abandoned mine field. One explosion dents the ball and sends him back into the air, and then down to the same escarpment as before. The entire sequence repeats, and after Wile E. misses him for a second time, the Road Runner holds up a sign that says HERE WE GO AGAIN, beeps, and dashes to the side. The title is based on the song title ""I'm Just Wild About Harry""."

There, civilization was far advanced, and it brought forth a race of supermen, whose mental and physical powers were developed to the absolute peak of human perfection. But there came a day when giant quakes threatened to destroy Krypton forever. One of the planet's leading scientists, sensing the approach of doom, placed his infant son in a small rocket ship and sent it hurtling in the direction of Earth, just as Krypton exploded. The rocket sped through star-studded space, landing safely on Earth with its precious burden: Krypton's sole survivor. A passing motorist found the uninjured child and took it to an orphanage. As the years went by and the child grew to maturity, he found himself possessed of amazing physical powers. Faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, able to leap tall buildings in a single bound, the infant of Krypton is now the Man of Steel: SUPERMAN! To best be in a position to use his powers in a never-ending battle for truth and justice, Superman has assumed the disguise of Clark Kent, mild-mannered reporter for a great metropolitan newspaper."" The story cuts to the Daily Planet building, where editor Perry White reveals to his two best field reporters Clark Kent and Lois Lane that an anonymous figure has been mailing death threats to the Planet, should he not be paid in one million dollars to stop his rampage. About the only clue given is the alias The Mad Scientist . White assigns Kent to handle the story, but Lois, portrayed here as a strong-willed woman, insists that she investigate as well, much to the supposed chagrin of Kent. Lois takes off in a private plane to an undisclosed location up at the mountain, where the main villain's secluded lair/laboratory is located. He is preparing to fire his futuristic weapon , until his pet bird spots her aircraft and alerts him. Upon her arrival, Lois introduces herself as a Journalist, but finds herself kidnapped, bound, and gagged, as the scientist boasts to her about the success of his plan, and then demonstrates the beam weapon by aiming it at a bridge and destroying it. While listening to the radio, Clark and the other journalists learn of the coming disaster by the military, who warns everyone to stay inside. Instinctively, Clark steps into a storage room and changes into Superman before flying away. The Mad Scientist then has the beam weapon weaken the foundations of the Daily Planet skyscraper, causing it to tip over. Fortunately, Superman arrives in time and prevents the structure from crashing into neighboring buildings or falling to the ground, successfully restoring the skyscraper to its upright orientation. Superman then pushes the death ray away from the base of the skyscraper, but shortly afterward gets struck down as the scientist turns up the weapon's power to its full force. Superman remains determined to fight it and soon perseveres against the beam by punching it repeatedly, gradually pounding the beam back to its source. Seeing that the beam has been overpowered, the horrified Mad Scientist increases power, but Superman uses that against him by twisting the weapon into a knot, preventing the beam energy from escaping, and the buildup of pressure causes the machine to overheat and explode. As the scientist's lab disintegrates with the weapon's demise, Superman arrives to rescue Lois who has been left there, while also capturing the scientist as he attempts to escape, flying them to safety. The scientist is jailed. The scene dissolves back to the Daily Planet building, where Clark Kent and Lois report back to Perry White. She has gotten a scoop on the story of the Mad Scientist, who is now in prison, and Perry commends her on doing it. Seeing she hasn't suspected a thing, Clark looks at the camera, winks, and nods to the audience, and the story ends."

Sabrina joins her new friends in making fun of Nichole, a ""bookworm"" who doesn't fit in, but, when Sabrina discovers that Nichole is a half-witch like herself, the pair become good friends. Sabrina's other friends figure something is going on between Sabrina and Nichole and set out to prove that Nichole is a half witch. They accomplish this by levitating up to a tree outside and find the half star on her hand. Nichole is ridiculed to the point that there is no end in plain view for Nicole. Sabrina visits Nichole in her dorm room and come together and begin their journey to the witches' realm in hopes of becoming full witches. Entering the witches' realm, Sabrina and Nichole stumble upon a witch with three doors leading to three fantasy worlds. Both girls enter the first door and become mermaids. Making their way back to the realm, they try the second door which makes them figure skaters. After skating into a Hockey net, a hockey player appears on the ice and shoots pucks into the net where both girls are in. the girls throw a few pucks at the hockey player in frustration and a hockey brawl takes place. Sabrina and Nichole escape from the pile and exit back into the realm. They go into the third and final door where they meet two princes and begin to dance. Enchantra finds out from the witch academy the two girls are in the realm and sends two of her minions to get them. Sabrina and Nichole reach the great wish-granting wisdom tree in the witches' realm. Sabrina steps forward first to make her wish and asks to be a full witch. Her wish is granted; by taking Nicole's half-witch powers. This makes Nichole a mortal and consequently turns her to stone since a mortal can't be in the witches' realm. Sabrina asks the tree to change her back, but it can't because the deed has already been done. It tells her that only a certain amulet can help her. Salem has told her that his collar is just this kind of artifact, so Sabrina hurriedly seeks him out. Unfortunately, he lied and she is unable to save Nicole. Distraught, she is about to turn herself into stone when she is stopped by Enchantra, who is touched by her unselfish action and breaks the spell on Nicole, returning both girls to half-witches in the process. At the graduation ceremony, Sabrina chides the school for making fun of Nicole because of her heritage, and reveals that she herself is a half-witch."

One day, while she and her siblings are on an outing with their father in his four-flippered submarine, Brunhilde is driven by a desire to see even more of the world and floats away on the back of a jellyfish. After an encounter with a fishing trawler , she ends up stuck in a bottle. She drifts to the shore of a small fishing town and is found and rescued by a small boy named S≈çsuke. He cuts his finger in the process, but Brunhilde licks his wound when he picks her up, and the wound heals almost instantly. After taking a great liking to her, S≈çsuke renames her Ponyo and promises to protect her forever. Meanwhile, a distraught Fujimoto is searching frantically for his daughter. Because of his own bad memories of the human world, he believes that S≈çsuke has kidnapped her, and he calls his wave spirits to recover her. After the wave spirits take Ponyo away, S≈çsuke is heartbroken and goes home with his mother, Lisa, who tries to cheer him up, to no avail. Ponyo and Fujimoto have a confrontation, during which Ponyo refuses to let her father call her by her birthname, ""Brunhilde"". She declares her name to be Ponyo and voices her desire to become human, because she has started to fall in love with S≈çsuke. Suddenly she starts to grow legs and turn into a human, a power granted to her by the human blood she ingested when she licked S≈çsuke's finger. Her father turns her back with difficulty and goes to summon Ponyo's mother, Granmamare. Meanwhile, Ponyo, with the help of her sisters, breaks away from her father and uses his magic to make herself fully human. The huge amount of magic that she inadvertently releases into the ocean causes an imbalance in the world, resulting in a huge tsunami. Running pell-mell over the waves of the storm, Ponyo goes back to visit S≈çsuke, who is amazed but overjoyed to see her. Lisa is equally amazed, but takes Ponyo's transformation in stride. Lisa, S≈çsuke, and Ponyo wait out the storm at S≈çsuke's house, with the new world an amazing journey of discovery for Ponyo. Worried about the residents of the nursing home where she works, Lisa leaves to check up on them, promising S≈çsuke that she will return as soon as possible. Granmamare arrives at Fujimoto's submarine. On her way there, S≈çsuke's father sees and recognizes her as the Goddess of Mercy. Fujimoto notices the moon appears to be falling out of its orbit and satellites are falling like shooting stars, symptoms of the dangerous imbalance of nature that now exists. Granmamare declares that if S≈çsuke can pass a test, Ponyo can live as a human and the world order will be restored. A still-worried Fujimoto reminds her that if S≈çsuke fails the test, Ponyo will turn into sea foam. S≈çsuke and Ponyo wake up to find that most of the land around the house has been covered by the ocean. Since it is impossible for Lisa to come home, the two children decide to find her. With the help of Ponyo's magic, they make S≈çsuke's toy boat life-size and set out across the ocean. Over the course of their journey, they see prehistoric fish swimming beneath them, and encounter several other evacuees in boats. After landing and finding Lisa's empty car, Ponyo and S≈çsuke head into a tunnel. There Ponyo loses her human form and reverts into a fish. Meanwhile, Lisa and the residents of the nursing home are below the surface, but have been temporarily given the power to breathe underwater. S≈çsuke and Ponyo encounter Fujimoto, but S≈çsuke doesn't trust him and attempts to flee. However, Fujimoto captures them and takes them down to the protected nursing home. S≈çsuke is reunited with Lisa and meets Granmamare, with whom Lisa has just had a long private conversation. Granmamare asks S≈çsuke if he can love Ponyo whether she is a fish or human. S≈çsuke replies that he ""loves all the Ponyos."" Granmamare then tells her daughter that if she chooses to become human once and for all, she will have to give up her magical powers. Ponyo agrees to this, so Granmamare encases her in a bubble and gives her to S≈çsuke, and tells him that kissing the bubble will complete Ponyo's transformation. The balance of nature is then restored, and the previously stranded ships head back to port, including S≈çsuke's father's. Ponyo jumps high in the air and kisses Sosuke, transforming back into a human."

He goes to West Bengal with his little sister Sita  where he tries to start a new life. In a refugee camp, they see the abduction of a low-caste woman and Ishwar takes her little son Abhiram  with him. He gets a job at a factory in the province, near the river Subarnarekha. After completing his study when Abhiram is asked to go to Germany for his studies, he  and Sita  discover that they are in love. But at this moment, Ishwar's fear of prejudice emerges, as he does not want his sister, a Brahmin, to marry a lower caste boy. During Sita's wedding with another man, the girl and Abhiram elope and go to Calcutta. Ishwar is angry and heartbroken. Sita and Abhiram live in the slums of Calcutta and try to make ends meet. They have a little son . One day, Abhiram gets a new job as a bus driver, but this leads to tragedy: when he accidentally hits and kills a little girl, he is lynched by the crowd. In her desperate situation, Sita is forced to think about taking up prostitution. In the meantime, Ishwar is living a lonely and sad life in the province. When his old time friend Haraprasad  comes to visit him, they decide to go to Calcutta on a binge-drinking tour. They finally end up in a brothel, both completely drunk. When Ishwar staggers into one of the bedchambers, he is faced... with his own sister, whose first ""client"" he should become. Sita immediately recognizes him and rather cuts her own throat than submit to incest. She dies. When Ishwar realizes what has happened, he breaks down. At the end of the film, the now completely broken Ishwar meets Sita's little son, who is now his closest relative. He brightens up and decides to take the little boy into his house."

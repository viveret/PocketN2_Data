Vitthal had studied Vedas and set out on pilgrimages at a young age. In Alandi, about 30 km from Pune, Sidhopant, a local Yajurveda Brahmin, was very much impressed with him and Vitthal married his daughter Rukmini. After some time, getting permission from Rukmini, Vitthal went to Kashi, where he met Ramananda Swami and requested to be initiated into sannyas, lying about his marriage. But Ramananda Swami later went to Alandi and, convinced that his student Vitthal was the husband of Rukmini, he returned to Kashi and ordered Vitthal to return home to his family. The couple was excommunicated from the Brahmin caste as Vitthal had broken with sannyas, the last of the four ashrams. Four children were born to them; Nivrutti, Dnyandev, Sopan, Mukta. It is believed that later Vitthal and Rukmini ended their lives by jumping into the waters at Prayag where the river Ganges meets Yamuna hoping that their children would be accepted into the society after their death. The orphaned children grew up on alms. They approached the Brahmin community of Paithan to accept them but the Brahmins refused. According to the disputed ""Shuddhi Patra"" the children were purified by the Brahmins on condition of observing celibacy. But when they returned the Brahmins did not pay any attention to the Shuddhi Patra and told that it was fake.

Dindo, who just also happens to be taking his rounds on a bicycle nearby, threatens Ivan with harm if Mariella were to visit her vengeance on Mabel. At the antique shop, Dindo tries to convince Mabel to leave Ivan, saying he is there to protect Mabel from Mariella. As Dindo leaves, Mabel notices that a dresser is vibrating. A large mirror on the dresser shatters after a Mariella apparition, and Mabel is drenched.

But none of them knows that something horrible is stalking this perfect family. On a fall afternoon in 1976, young Annie hears a noise from upstairs. Her mother has collapsed and died, and an agonizing downward spiral begins, as we interweave her story with another… Far away, a brilliant research geneticist at UC Berkeley named Mary-Claire King is embarking on something of a personal crusade to uncover the genetic roots of breast cancer. While still in her twenties, she has already made a famous discovery that made the cover of Science magazine -- quantifying the genetic variation between humans and chimpanzees.King, M-C. and Wilson, A.C. ""Evolution at two levels in humans and chimpanzees."" Science 188, 107-116 . But her conviction that there is a hereditary basis to at last some forms of breast cancer is not widely shared. Nevertheless, her tireless research throughout the 1980s would end in a medical breakthrough -- the discovery of the location of the BRCA1 hereditary breast cancer gene -- considered one of the most important scientific discoveries of the twentieth centuryKevin Davies and Michael White. ""Breakthrough: The Race to Find the Breast Cancer Gene."" . and touch thousands of lives, including that of a young woman living thousands of miles away, named Anne Parker. At the age of 19, after the sudden death of her father, Anne marries Paul and soon is pregnant. She struggles to find a way in the world with her equally young but misguided husband and her older sister who tries to become a surrogate parent to Anne. But, cruelly, Anne’s sister contracts the same cancer that killed their mother, and in a few months, she too is dead. Married, with a child, and only in her 20’s, Anne Parker’s challenges have hardly begun. She herself is diagnosed with the same disease that killed her mother and sister—breast cancer. It is severe and surgery and chemotherapy with all its accompanying difficulties soon follows. She loses her hair and if that was that enough to endure, her husband, never really mature or stable, has begun an affair with Anne’s closest friend, and leaves her, shortly before she is diagnosed with a second cancer. And this is where many stories would end; with tragedy of unimaginable anguish and an almost surreal relentlessness, but Anne Parker is not an ordinary woman and hers is not an ordinary story. With the help of a young doctor, Sean, and a new friend, Kim, Anne continues her fight. As each tragedy befalls her, something remarkable happens. She grows stronger. As each new sadness comes, she grows more resolved; as her world becomes darker, she becomes, well… funnier. So funny that she makes other patients laugh. So funny her doctors are far more serious about her illness than she is. So positive, that she becomes a life force onto herself, determined to survive it all. And something else —- she believes that she must find the genetic secret that hid in her family and had killed almost all of them. It becomes the focus of her considerable energies. While Annie struggles, King is pursuing her belief that some forms of breast and ovarian cancer have a hereditary basis. While she captures headlines for her work applying DNA fingerprinting to help reunite ""the disappeared"" with their families in Argentina, her priority is to map the breast cancer gene. King focuses on collecting families with a particularly high incidence of breast cancer, suspecting that these cases are most likely to reveal any genetic predispositions. Advances in genetic mapping through the 1980s gradually allow her team to embark on studies to map the location of the BRCA1 gene. Finally, in 1990, King and her team find conclusive evidence linking DNA markers on chromosome 17 with an inherited flaw in a gene dubbed BRCA1. The work was presented at the American Society of Human Genetics conference in Cincinnati, and published in Science magazine a short time later.Hall, J.M. et al. ""Linkage of early-onset familial breast cancer to chromosome 17q21."" Science 250, 1684-89 . Mary Claire King ended up on the cover of Time magazine; and Anne Parker finally had the answer she herself had long sought. This same Anne Parker, now happily remarried, who a few years later would contract cancer for a third time. And she would survive again. And she laughed while being treated, for reasons only she knew and understood. Anne Parker still lives a full life to this day.http://www.facebook.com/pages/Decoding-Annie-Parker/218537534833277?sk=info"

One day he attends a minor league hockey game with his friend Pat . Pat taunts the visiting team during a fight and one of their players climbs into the stands, calling him a homosexual slur. Doug, in defense of his gay brother, Ira, quickly knocks him out, which prompts the rest of the crowd to cheer him on. Soon after, Doug gets a phone call from the coach of his hometown team who offers him a job as an enforcer. In the meantime, veteran enforcer and Doug's idol Ross ""The Boss"" Rhea  is demoted to the minors after serving a 20 game suspension for slashing an opponent in the head from behind. Three years prior, Rhea hit and concussed the highly skilled prospect Xavier Laflamme  who has had trouble recovering from that incident due to the fear of being hit, being stuck in the minors and falling in with the wrong crowd. After earning himself the nickname ""The Thug"", Doug is called up to Canada and hired by Laflamme's team, the Halifax Highlanders, to protect Laflamme and be his roommate. The Highlanders experience success with Doug as their primary enforcer, and he quickly gains popularity among fans and teammates much to the chagrin of his parents and Laflamme, particularly after losing ice time and the alternate-captaincy to Doug. Doug becomes romantically involved with Eva , a hockey fan with a penchant for players. With 4 games left on their schedule, the Highlanders need two wins to secure a playoff spot. On a road game in Quebec, after an opposing player concusses Laflamme with a heavy hit, Doug savagely beats the player unconscious and is suspended for the next game against Rhea and the St. John's Shamrocks. Doug encounters Rhea at a diner, where Rhea dismisses Doug's claim that he is a hockey player, calling him a goon. Though Rhea acknowledges Doug's physical prowess and gives Doug his respect, Rhea warns him that if they ever meet on the ice, he will ""lay [him] the fuck out."" The Highlanders, with Doug suspended and Laflamme hospitalized, lose to the Shamrocks. Doug reaches out to Laflamme, and promises him he will always have his back on the ice. In their next game, the Highlanders lead 1–0 thanks to renewed teamwork between Doug and Laflamme. In the dying seconds, Doug blocks a slapshot with his face and his ankle is injured in the ensuing scramble. The Highlanders win, but need a win against Rhea and the Shamrocks in their last game for a playoff spot. After two periods, the Shamrocks are beating the Highlanders 2–0. Rhea and Doug drop the gloves in the third period, and dole out and receive physical punishment during the fight. Doug is knocked down first, but Rhea calls off the linesmen and allows him to get back up. Doug manages to break Rhea's nose, but breaks his previously injured ankle in the process. Doug manages to stand back up and knocks out Rhea with a vicious cross. Eva and his teammates help a seriously injured Doug off the ice and Laflamme, inspired by Doug's efforts and Rhea's defeat, scores a natural hat-trick to lead the Highlanders to a 3–2 victory and a playoff berth. While being comforted by Eva in the locker room, Doug victoriously comments, ""I think I nailed him."" in reference to Rhea."

The story shuttles between Vandiyathevan's travels in Chola country and the young Prince Arulmozhivarman's travels in Sri Lanka. The narrative deals with attempts by his sister Kundavai to bring back Arulmozhi  to establish political peace in a land seemingly getting besot with unrest and signs of civil war, plotted by vassals and petty chieftains. Parantaka Chola was succeeded by his second son Gandaraditya as the first son Rajaditya had died in a battle. At the time of Gandaraditya's death, his son Maduranthaka was a child and hence Gandaraditya’s brother Arinjaya ascended the throne. After Arinjaya’s death, his son Parantaka II, Sundara Chola was coronated. He had two sons, Aditya Karikalan and daughter Kundavai and the younger son Arulmozhivarman,the later known Rajaraja. When the story starts, the emperor Sundara Chola is ill and bedridden. Aditya Karikalan is the general of the Northern Command and lived in Kanchi and Arulmozhivarman  is in Sri Lanka in battle and their sister Kundavai Piratti lived in Chola royal household at Pazhayarai. The story is set in motion, when rumor starts that there is a conspiracy against Sundara Chola and his sons. One person who gets a glimpse of the Pandya conspirators is a warrior the Vanar kula veeran Vallavarayan Vandiyathevan. It is through Vandiyathevan that we meet most of the characters in the novel such as Arulmozhivarman, the prince whom all the people loved, and Periya Pazhavetturayar, the chancellor who married Nandhini, when he was sixty. During his youth, Aditya Karikalan had fallen in love with Nandhini, but she turned vengeful after Aditya Karikalan killed Veerapandyan  and vowed to destroy the Chola dynasty. We also meet Kundavai Devi, who after hearing the news of the conspiracy sends Vandiyathevan to Sri Lanka to give a message to Arulmozhivarman to come back immediately. Besides these, there are other characters like Maduranthaka Thevar, the son of Gandaraditya and Aniruddha Brahmarayar,Sundara Cholar’s Prime Minister and the man who has eyes and ears everywhere. But the most wonderful character in the book is Brahmarayar’s spy Azhwarkadiyan Nambi, a who roams around the country challenging for debates. He collects information for the Prime Minister and is always around Vandiyathevan, rescuing him during trouble. There are some lovely women too, like Vanathi,Kodumbalur princess who is in love with Arulmozhi; Poonkuzhali, the boat woman who rows the future king to Lanka; Mandakini, the deaf and dumb step mother of the original maduranthaka chola and Rakkammal, the wife of a boatman who supports the Pandya conspirators. Most memorable among these is Nandhini, whose beauty is said to have the power to influence any man and manimegalai, the sister of kandhamaranwho helps nandhini without any knowledge that she herself is the conspirator and also he turns against Vandhiyathevan, his best friend. In the meanwhile, With Poonkuzhali's help, Vandiyathevan reaches Sri Lanka, meets Arulmozhivarman, and becomes his close friend. In Lanka, Arulmozhivarman realizes that his father had spent some time in an island near Lanka and had been with a girl born deaf and dumb. He meets her and realizes from her drawing that she and his father have had two children. Who are those children and do they have the right to the throne?

Twelvetrees nevertheless responds with an unintentional wit and bumbling characteristic throughout the rest of the film. After they send him to bed, Stewart and Jessica talk cryptically about not being able to find something in his luggage and concluding he must have it elsewhere. Later on Twelvetrees is chided by Stewart for nearly walking in on a restricted room – Stewart explains his ill brother Victor is in there. Then during his sleep Twelvetrees is woken to a commotion downstairs: Stewart's other brother Reggie  and his daughter Verity  have arrived with Reggie demanding his regular allowance from Victor. Spying on the proceedings Twelvetrees spots Stewart going elsewhere to see his mother. The next day, after being introduced to a snake house underground, Twelvetrees secretly goes upstairs to see Stewart's mother: though kept behind a locked door she initially seems extremely polite and explains her family's history of theatrics in India. Suddenly, she tries to kill Twelvetrees with a knife but he is saved by Patel – the servant explains her presence there is secret lest she be taken away. Though very unnerved, Stewart persuades Twelvetrees to stay to perform that evening. Before doing so another brother arrives; Ernest  and his wife Aggie arrive to demand his regular allowance – both he and Reggie have found their cheques from Victor have been bouncing. Suspicious that Stewart is trying to change Victor's will to his favour, Reggie and Ernest resolve to stay and make sure that doesn't happen. In the meantime, Verity persuades Twelvetrees to check up on Victor, and to their shock discover the bed in his room is filled by a dummy. Confronted, Stewart tells Reggie and Ernest that Victor is dead and reveals another secret: Twelvetrees is in fact Victor's secret son and that he is entitled to everything in Victor's will. Plus, Stewart is convinced Twelvetrees unknowingly has a clue to where a batch of diamonds are hidden on the estate. Ernest and Aggie, after their own search, are convinced they've found the clue is a framed misquoted motto and plan to kill Twelvetrees with poison: Stewart foils the plan and works out they know whatever the clue must be. Later that evening during a Henderson family performance Ernest is killed with a stab to the back. Petrified, Twelvetrees makes a hasty exit only to be pursued by Verity: she convinces him to come back after she reveals the true identity of his father and his place in his will: he is in line to take over his money, the house and its estates. Whilst confronting his uncles, Foster is told by Verity about the diamonds, their secret location and the fact he might be in possession of a clue to their location. Whilst he goes for the police Foster gets lost in the forest and eventually finds Patel: he tells him to go in his place. However, having taken some of his clothes, Patel is mistaken by the Henderson mother and she kills him as he walks through the woods. Going back to the house, Foster meets up with Verity again to find Jessica – in possession of his framed motto – and Agnes dead by the snakehouse. Foster explains he received the motto in the post and Verity notices it's inaccurate. Explaining that it came with a birth certificate, Verity concludes the clue must be in his name. Foster goes to get it – learning his real name is Nigel Anthony Julian Amadeus Henderson – but comes back to Verity on the floor. Reggie walks in immediately and says she's dead. Foster, left alone, works out the clue: his initials form naja – a genus of snake, and he finds a package in the snake house. Confronted then by Stewart – Reggie having been killed in the interim – Foster refuses to hand it over and a violent chase ensues, but Foster traps Stewart with his mother. Downstairs, Foster is confronted by an alive Verity pointing a gun at him. She demands the diamonds and he unwraps the package, throwing the covering paper into the fire. However, the document inside reveals the covering paper was actually the map to the diamonds hidden in the estate, by the time they realize the map is already burned away. The film ends with Stewart, Verity and the Henderson mother being taken away in a police cart, whilst a camera shot moves away from Foster beginning to dig in the large grounds outside the house to find the diamonds.

Whilst he goes for the police Foster gets lost in the forest and eventually finds Patel: he tells him to go in his place. However, having taken some of his clothes, Patel is mistaken by the Henderson mother and she kills him as he walks through the woods. Going back to the house, Foster meets up with Verity again to find Jessica – in possession of his framed motto – and Agnes dead by the snakehouse. Foster explains he received the motto in the post and Verity notices it's inaccurate. Explaining that it came with a birth certificate, Verity concludes the clue must be in his name. Foster goes to get it – learning his real name is Nigel Anthony Julian Amadeus Henderson – but comes back to Verity on the floor. Reggie walks in immediately and says she's dead. Foster, left alone, works out the clue: his initials form naja – a genus of snake, and he finds a package in the snake house. Confronted then by Stewart – Reggie having been killed in the interim – Foster refuses to hand it over and a violent chase ensues, but Foster traps Stewart with his mother. Downstairs, Foster is confronted by an alive Verity pointing a gun at him. She demands the diamonds and he unwraps the package, throwing the covering paper into the fire. However, the document inside reveals the covering paper was actually the map to the diamonds hidden in the estate, by the time they realize the map is already burned away. The film ends with Stewart, Verity and the Henderson mother being taken away in a police cart, whilst a camera shot moves away from Foster beginning to dig in the large grounds outside the house to find the diamonds.

With his offbeat buddy, Tom , tagging along, Luke returns to Afghanistan and intends to gather enough evidence to get his old story into print. But he soon finds that the country is an even more dangerous place than when he left. To make matters worse, his old friend and fixer, Mateen  has been hired away by Luke's journalistic nemesis, Imran Sahar . Soon the trip for Luke and Tom in Afghanistan turns into a surreal and perilous adventure, a journey into an alternate reality, filtered through a haze of gun smoke. They encounter Taliban raids, bombings and unfinished business with an Afghanistan businessman. Luke still makes his way through the wilderness with Canadian troops and Arabian guides to find out if his story is true or not. In the end, he realises that the rumour about Canadians mutilating fingers is a lie and that his people still have some morality in this war torn land. Just as he is about to leave, He and Sgt. Rick  come under fire from a Taliban sniper, but the Taliban runs out of bullets and walks off, while Luke thinks he killed him. While they move back to the base, Luke runs into Matteen, where he finds out that they really do share a friendship. The last scene is where Luke decides to go home.

Because of his devotion, Lord Vishnu appears before him every day, and eats whatever he is given as a prasad offering. Santha, the daughter of the proud and powerful Rajaguru, learning of this, visits his hut to discover whether it is true. When she witnesses it for herself, she informs her father of this wonder. Angry that his daughter has visited the house of an untouchable, he locks her up. He then informs Jeevudu that the king's mother was performing a cheppula nomu  and needs a thousand sandals by next morning. Jeevudu and his family work all night, but can only make a few sandals. They fall asleep from exhaustion; when they awaken the next morning, they find the house full of sandals.

The district attorney, Dan Callahan, on a hunting trip with Judge Leland Hoffman, is summoned back to the city to handle the murder investigation. Callahan and Hoffman both have political ambitions, eyeing the upcoming election for governor. The high-profile nature of the murder case persuades Callahan that it could vault him to the governor's office if he prosecutes it himself. He personally arrests the prime suspect, Thornwall, a wealthy man with political connections whose wife is the victim. Hoffman is assigned to be the judge in the case, which could impact his own political future. A senator, Alex Simon, informs both the judge and D.A. that he intends to pursue the governor's office himself, claiming he wishes to come home after serving in Washington, D.C., for many years. His wife, Cathy, was once romantically involved with Judge Hoffman, who is bribed with an appointment to the federal bench if he agrees to not oppose Simon for governor. Callahan turns ruthless and vindictive in achieving his political aims, determined to win at any cost. His right-hand man unethically blurts on the witness stand that the defendant had once before threatened his wife. This evidence is inadmissible hearsay and the judge orders it stricken from the record, but the jury, armed with this knowledge, convicts the defendant of murder in the first degree. The senator dies of a heart attack. Hoffman's guilty conscience forces him to go public with the revelation that Simon offered him a bribe. His career is ruined, but Cathy is proud of him for standing by his convictions. A gardener who committed the murder flees town in a panic, is apprehended by police and confesses to the crime. When the gubernatorial convention fails to win Callahan a majority, Hoffman arrives and is swept up by the admiring crowd to the party's nomination.

His parents, Andrzej and Beata, are a minister and an ad executive, respectively. Dominik has a charmed life. He is popular at his private school, an orange belt in judo, and has a personal driver. He has been spoiled by the perks his parents give him. He demands strangers refer to him as 'sir' and constantly tells people to turn off their radios, whether he knows them or not, because he doesn't like techno. While at school, his friends stumble upon a self-harm video while using his computer. While picking up a jacket from his mother's office, he is accidentally locked in a hallway. He watches the rest of the self-harm video, and leaves comments for the poster. Later at prom, the parents show how removed they are from Dominik's life when the headmaster makes an appearance and they had no clue who he was. After the parents leave prom, the students begin their after party. While drinking, a girl admits to lesbian experimentation. She agrees to demonstrate for her friends, to their amusement. Dominik is then asked to kiss a boy, for the group's continued amusement. He agrees and makes out with one of his friends. They begin making out, as the joke wears on too long. A video of the kiss is posted to social media sites shortly after. Dominik's friends tease him about the make-up in the following days. He's plays along, returning his male friend's 'pretend' longing gaze. Dominik and his friend then go to judo practice. Dominik is quickly pinned beneath his friend, but does not try to escape. Being beneath his friend excites him to the point of ejaculation. The story quickly ends up on a Facebook-like site. This angers Dominik and he's invited to come speak on a 3D social network. He meets Sylwia , a suicidal girl who cuts and wears a mask, in 'Sala Samobójców' or The Suicide Room. Sylwia and Dominik share laughs and conversations that link them together, for better and worse. Dominik begins skipping school to spend more time with Sylwia. Dominik returns to The Suicide Room to meet Sylwia again only to be met by Sylwia's followers. Dominik challenges Jasper, the first follower to confront him, to a duel in F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin. Dominik spends most of the fight running, but manages to win by using a rocket launcher at point-blank range as Jasper enters a room, despite the blast killing himself as well. Defeating Jasper earns the respect of the rest of Sylwia's followers, but Jasper acts out and is banished from the group. In The Suicide Room, the group watches films of people killing themselves. When Dominik is logging off, he says he has to go. Sylwia says he is like the ocean, and explains that they can't make him do anything. Dominik and his family go to see another opera, where they try to pair him with another family's daughter. Dominik acts out and says that he's gay and begins to make out with one of the male busts in the lobby. His parents, embarrassed by Dominik's outburst, are angry with him and force him to go back to school. He returns home and sees a video about the kissing incident, showing shadow puppets named after the two boys engage in various homosexual acts. The video drives Dominik to tears and causes him to rampage through his room. Sylwia mocks him for being upset. When he continues to cry, she calls him different. Because he is different, Sylwia encourages him to scare the normal people. Dominik changes his style, adopting the hair styles and clothing of the emo subculture, and takes his father's gun to school. When his judo partner approaches him with some friends after school, Dominik panics and runs to the safety of a taxi. When recounting the incident to Sylwia, he claims that he had scared his friend, and was in total control of the situation. She believes his lie, and is impressed with him. They return to The Suicide Room and Dominik finds out that Sylwia is a shut-in and hadn't left her room in 3 years. Dominik stays locked in his room for 10 days talking with her and refusing to eat. His parents, who often spend days out of the house on business, don't notice. Eventually, their housekeeper calls the police, who they break in to find Dominik sitting in a pool of his blood beside a broken mirror. He is sent to a hospital and kept in a psychiatric ward for 3 days. His parents, having finally returned home and found him missing, arrive to take him home. They claim he shouldn't be wasting time at the hospital when his final exams are so close. The doctor refuses to release him to their protective custody because Dominik refuses to talk to them, and they were obviously unaware he had quit going to school ten days ago. Eventually, Dominik agrees to go home. When he returns to The Suicide Room, he hears the group discussing their plans for suicide, but they refuse to discuss it with him. Upon hearing that his parents are trying to get him to speak with a psychologist, Sylwia opens up to him. She tells him a love story that ends with the lovers killing themselves with pills and alcohol. After telling Dominik that this is how she wants to die, she begs him to get pills for her from the doctor. Their talk is interrupted when footprints begin appearing in the sand. After a short fight, the invisible spy is revealed to be Jasper. Jasper admits to hacking The Suicide Room, and having learned the truth about many of the members. He gives examples of how their avatars in the game hide their personal shortcomings, such as a thin girl really being very fat, or the large Minotaur being a man in a wheelchair. Dominik kills him after he calls Sylwia a whore. Dominik's parents write Dominik a letter, at the doctor's behest. He reads it to Sylwia, who finds it hilarious. Dominik rips the letter up. His parents decide that the doctor's methods won't cure Dominik before his final exams, so they demand the name of one that with simply give him drugs. When the new doctor arrives and interviews Dominik, Sylwia feeds him answers that will lead the doctor to give him the right pills. He follows the lines Sylwia gives him, but continually remarks about how no one should want to die, in a plea to make her reconsider her suicide. As Dominik and Sylwia discuss where to meet and transfer the pills, she tells him that failure to show up would mean he could never talk to her again. Before the plans are set, Dominik's father rips out the router. Dominik panics, bouncing from threatening to kill his parents to begging his 'Mummy' to help her son. His mother attempts to plug the cords back in, but his father stops her physically. Dominik bursts from his room and collapses. Later, explains to his parents what The Suicide Room is. He tells them that the members are his new family, and is banned from returning, even to explain that he can't come back. Still wanting to see Sylwia, he takes the pills to the bar they had discussed. The bartender forces him to order something, which leads to Dominik drinking a large beer. He heads to the bathroom, and decides to dump the pills. After throwing a few handfuls into the toilet, Dominik takes one of the pills. Two handfuls of the medicine follow, and he quickly starts feeling ill. Dominik finds a couple making out, and starts filming them. They take the camera and begin filming Dominik's delirium. He mocks his father and himself, laughing at his own drunken imitations. He returns to the bar and sees Sylwia - this is an illusion from the pills Dominik has taken. He imagines they walk out onto the dance floor and kiss. Later at The Suicide Room Sylwia is talking to her followers and asks if he's ever been gone for so long before. They talk as Sylwia stays by herself. They see Dominik walk up and go to meet him, but it is his mother using his account. She thanks them for being there for him and supporting him, but announces that he was dead. While she talks, all of The Suicide Room's members log out. Sylwia rips the internet chord out from the wall and stumbles through her room, knocking over piles of garbage. She opens her door and goes outside for the first time in three years, bawling and screaming in the grass out front. The movie ends with Dominik's parents at a ballet, though divorced and sitting in different places. The drunk couple's footage of Dominik is interspersed with the ballet. It is revealed that, instead of returning to the bar, Dominik was screaming for his parents in the bathroom of the bar as he died from overdosing. The video ends up on The Suicide Room wall.

While seeming cruel to some, the brigade adds small, encouraging notes to the lumps such as ""Try Harder next year,"" in an attempt to steer the children back to the nice list. With the Big 2-5 fast approaching, Wayne and Lanny must race to recover classified North Pole technology that has fallen into the hands of a hacker identified only as ""jinglesmell1337."" Desperate to prevent Christmas from descending into chaos, Wayne seeks out  the foremost Naughty Kid expert to aid in the mission, a bombastic member of the Coal Elf Brigade who also happens to be his estranged younger  brother, Noel. Reluctant to take the extroverted Noel along with him, Wayne relents, and Noel joins the Prep & Landing team on the mission. During the trip, Noel and Wayne reminisce about their childhood, when they worked together far better than they do now. As the trio arrives at the hacker's house, Wayne sets off a booby trap, imperiling the entire team; Wayne takes a particular beating while Noel is able to defend himself. Lanny, however, is able to infiltrate the hacker's room, only to be taken captive . The hacker then reveals herself to be Grace Goodwin, whose sole mission is to get herself off the naughty list, believing that she had been set up by her toddler brother, who had destroyed her favorite toy and ruined her chances to ask Santa for a new one by his crying. After a somewhat intoxicated Lanny suggests using the ""magic word"" to get the password for the device that will get her off the list, she does just that: using the word ""please"" as the password, since genuinely naughty kids never say ""please."" At first, she appears successful in changing her status from naughty to nice, but the device malfunctions, threatening to place the entire planet on the naughty list unless she and the team can pull off a risky operation to fix the problem. Meanwhile, Wayne is particularly bitter at being ""shown up"" by his younger brother, prompting a fight in the street in front of Grace's house in which Wayne wishes he never had a brother. Shocked at his statement, Noel  asks Wayne to say he didn't mean it, then throws what he had intended to give Wayne as a Christmas present at him. The gift --a toy sled that Wayne had wanted as a boy but was never able to get-- prompts Wayne to reconcile with Noel and carry out the mission. Grace, watching the whole argument as it unfolds, learns a powerful lesson and a newfound appreciation for her younger brother. The next morning, the scene at the Goodwin house shows Grace's toddler brother giving her her new Christmas present, a replacement toy for the one he had destroyed a year prior. Meanwhile, back at the North Pole, Wayne and Noel both win the title of ""Elves of the Year"" for their efforts and cooperation."

He sees a red tram out his window and leaves his apartment to wait for the next tram to come by. As he sees the next tram approaching him, he puts his arms up to signal it to stop. At the same time, the wind begins to blow and a curtain from an open window in his apartment complex blows outward toward the sky. He boards the tram and for a while rides through the night continuously looking forward instead of out the windows at the scenery. Finally, in slow motion, he begins to move toward the curtain on the window of the tram and pulls it back. He sees strange objects as he passes through the night. All these objects are the only thing he can see when he passes them because they are engulfed in light, while the areas surrounding the objects is pitch black. As the tram continues on, it appears to disappear around him and he is back in a makeshift version of his apartment looking out the blinds of his window. He closes the blinds and seems to be startled by something. He follows it to the vent in his wall and looks into it. There appears to be nothing in the vent and he turns away disappointed. The wind begins to blow harder outside as another tram passes by his apartment complex. He then gets the idea to take off the screen of his vent and stick his hand into it. As he reaches trying to find anything in the vent the scenery of the movie changes again and he is back riding on the tram holding what looks like a crumbled piece of paper with a blood stain on it. After he sees the paper he passes out in the seat of the tram and awakens in the makeshift version of his apartment. He puts the crumbled, blood-stained paper on a hanger to dry and the movie begins to spin showing different unidentifiable objects. Finally, the movie stops spinning and shows the front of a church. The man is again inside of the red tram, that seems to be driving through the middle of the church, looking out of the window. The screen switches from pitch black to different arts on the inside of the church in the point of view like the audience themselves are riding the tram. Time passes and the man is at a loss of where he is. He looks around confused and again, finds himself in his apartment. It is obvious that time has passed because the lighting is much darker and the mood is much more sleepy. After this, the man is on the tram and the scenery switches between him on the tram and the objects from earlier in the movie. The man is riding along and the tram accelerates. The tram goes faster and faster and the man's head thrusts back as the wind blows against him. This results in him falling off of a chair that he apparently played like it was the tram.

Sixteen years later, Darius moves to the town of Smithfield as the new mailman, cryptically telling anyone who asks that his predecessor is ""out of town"" for an indeterminate amount of time. Behind his initially cheerful facade, Darius is a psychopath who spends his free time reading and tampering with the mail of people on his route, rewriting letters and smashing packages, among other acts of vandalism. Aiding Darius is a local teenage delinquent named Daniel Everson, who had become disillusioned after discovering his older sister, Beth, and best friend, Jay, are dating, and after being told by Darius that he is adopted. Unbeknownst to Daniel however, Darius is serial killer who murders people who become suspicious of him, such as a gas meter man, and Daniel's girlfriend, Veronica. After the two enact a plan to blackmail the mayor using information on his family's illegal activities they had gleaned from the mail, Darius reveals to Daniel that he is his biological brother, and that he had moved to Smithfield to find and reconnect with him. Shortly after returning to Darius's house, Darius sends Daniel out to get beer, and while he is gone, Darius kills a hitman sent by the mayor to deal with him.

Sixteen years later, Darius moves to the town of Smithfield as the new mailman, cryptically telling anyone who asks that his predecessor is ""out of town"" for an indeterminate amount of time. Behind his initially cheerful facade, Darius is a psychopath who spends his free time reading and tampering with the mail of people on his route, rewriting letters and smashing packages, among other acts of vandalism. Aiding Darius is a local teenage delinquent named Daniel Everson, who had become disillusioned after discovering his older sister, Beth, and best friend, Jay, are dating, and after being told by Darius that he is adopted. Unbeknownst to Daniel however, Darius is serial killer who murders people who become suspicious of him, such as a gas meter man, and Daniel's girlfriend, Veronica. After the two enact a plan to blackmail the mayor using information on his family's illegal activities they had gleaned from the mail, Darius reveals to Daniel that he is his biological brother, and that he had moved to Smithfield to find and reconnect with him. Shortly after returning to Darius's house, Darius sends Daniel out to get beer, and while he is gone, Darius kills a hitman sent by the mayor to deal with him. Just as Darius disposes of the hitman's body, Beth and Jay break in, having become concerned about the new mailman's activities, and his relationship with Daniel. After the two discover the body of the original mailman  stuffed in a closet, Darius appears, knocks them out, and ties them up, intent on raping Beth and forcing Jay to watch. As Darius strips Beth, Daniel returns, and is ordered to kill Beth by Darius, who says she is not his real sister, and that her family will never truly accept him like he does. Instead of obeying his brother, Daniel stabs him with a letter opener, and releases Beth and Jay. While a hysterical Daniel breaks down sobbing, Beth and Jay embrace, not noticing Darius's eyes open."

The second story is about how two BFFs become total frenemies over a senior editor job. The last story is about two lookalikes  who swap lives with each other, like The Prince and the Pauper.  The first story is about a science whiz teenage boy at Waterbury High School named Jake Logan ([[Nick Robinson  who is best friends with his dog, Murray . A popular girl named Julianne  tries to come between them as she tries to get Murray out of her way as Murray sees right through her ruse. Determined to get another ""A"", she makes Jake her ""boyfriend"" . When she finds out that Murray tried to flush her love letter to Jake down the toilet, she hatches a plan to get Murray out of her way for good. She steals Jake’s national prize certificate in molecular astrophysics from NASA, drenches it in her perfume like she did with her love letter, and drops it through the mail slot in Jake’s front door. Just like Julianne expected, Murray takes Jake’s NASA certificate into the bathroom and attempts to flush it. Jake, who is able to save his certificate, gets angry and yells at Murray to go away. Murray follows his command and runs away from home. A classmate named Savannah O'Neal , who loves to skate board and has a crush on Jake, finds Murray and takes him to her house. The next day, Jake starts to worry that Murray might not return, but manages to finish his and Julianne's science project. At school, Jake attempts to dress cool to impress Julianne, but Avalon Greene  and Halley Brandon  intervene and tone down his appearance.

Savannah uses this opportunity to expose Julianne’s ruse of using ""boyfriends"" to get A’s which results in Julianne being caught. Murray runs in and knocks over Julianne and the science project. Although the project is destroyed, Jake is happy to see Murray and they become best friends again.  The second story is about Avalon Greene  and Halley Brandon  who created a web magazine called ""GeeklyChic.""

During the talk, Cherie St. Claire tells Avalon and Halley that she likes their web magazine and offers to buy it, but decides to only let one of them be the senior editor. Cherie St. Claire decides to let each of them write a cover article and will judge who wrote the best article as that writer will become the senior editor. Avalon and Halley, who both want to be hired as senior editors, both decide to interview a French singer named Jean Frank after his first American sold-out concert which leads them to become frenemies. At the end, they decide that they will share the article. Cherie St. Claire becomes angry and decides not to hire either of them. The television show “Teens Now” picks up their article about Jean Frank changing his image as he was only posing as a singer from Paris, France. “Teens Now” also broadcasts their blog’s website for their audience to check out. Seeing that their web magazine has gone global on their hit counter map, Avalon and Halley make up as best friends again.

However, when the two hungry pals go to eat at a restaurant, Mickey discovers his cup is filled only with nails, nuts, and bolts. Mickey walks away disgusted and happens upon the home of a rich family. Inside, a crying child keeps throwing away toys given to him by his father and a butler. When the boy hears Pluto outside he demands his father to buy the dog. The butler goes outside and offers Mickey money for Pluto, but Mickey earnestly refuses. As he runs away, Mickey slips on some ice and his cello slides into the street where it is trampled by a horse-drawn sleigh. The party in the sleigh cheerfully  call out ""Merry Christmas!"" Later on, Mickey and Pluto come across the house of a poor cat family. A single mother sits at the table crying and Mickey and Pluto can see that the father is in jail and she has no food or toys for her children. Emotionally moved by the scene, Mickey returns to the rich man's house and reluctantly sells Pluto. With the money, he buys toys and food for the family. He then makes it back to the house, where the mother is now snoring, and delivers the goods dressed as Santa Claus. He barely manages to keep it quiet until he has snuck out of the house, just in time to see the children wake up to celebrate Christmas. Mickey is then satisfied that he helped the cat family to have a happy Christmas, but he still misses Pluto. Meanwhile back at the rich family's house, Pluto is treated badly by his new young owner. The child harasses Pluto, throwing food at his father and butler, and destroys much of the house, including the Christmas tree. At last unable to take it anymore, the father, a scoundrel, orders the Butler to throw Pluto out, and then he spanks his son to starve him and assassinate him. Pluto finds Mickey sitting atop a hill in front of a fire along with a snow sculpture of his absent dog. Pluto burrows through the snow and pops his head out the top of the sculpture surprising Mickey. The two of them share a roasted chicken which the boy had tied to Pluto's tail.

He has plied his trade for Sun Yat-Sen in the Xinhai Revolution, the Mexican Revolution and with the Spanish in the Rif War for de Rivera. Now he is content to be a Legionnaire in the 20th Marching Company of the 3rd Foreign Infantry Regiment with his comrades in arms the American Muggsy and the Englishman Bilgey. Bob's world changes in a variety of ways. First half his company is lost in attacks by Shiek Ibrahim-Ul-Ahmed's insurgents who capture the company's cargo of crated machine guns and ammunition. Fortunately for the Legion the weapons are disassembled and none of the Shiek's band has the knowledge to get them into working order. Granted leave in the town of Zabala, Bob is romantically pursued by Nina De Bernay, a French nightclub singer. Nina entertains the Legion but is romantically pursued herself by Bob's Sergeant Garcia; however Bob believes Nina to be his Sergeant's woman and does not pursue her. Arriving with a draft of replacements for the 20th Company is Bob's own younger brother Don who admires Bob's carefree action packed international lifestyle. Initially upset that Don has thrown away his university education and business potential away, Bob soon resigns himself to his brother's company. Problems arise when Nina, who can not have Bob and doesn't like Sgt Garcia makes a play for Don. Immature and oblivious to local custom and military disclipine, Don strikes Sergeant Garcia who gleefully has him arrested and vows to send him to the dreaded Penal Battalion. Bob breaks the chain of command to appeal directly to his Regimental Commander to avoid ruining Don's life and the Colonel allows Don's release. Unknown to all, Nina uses her friendship with Shiek Ibrahim-Ul-Ahmed to have two of his men free Don and smuggle him to a port where he may leave French North Africa and desert the Legion. Bob and his two friends Muggsy and Bilgey desert themselves to bring Don back. They track and ambush the party killing one of the Arabs, however the survivor brings reinforcements who capture the Legionnaires. The Shiek initially treats his captives kindly; in order to obtain information. He then uses the opportunity to have Don teach his men how to assemble and use the Hotchkiss M1914 machine guns that they captured from the Legion. This is beyond Don's knowledge but the Shiek knows of Bob's expertise and tortures Don until Bob performs these duties. Bob agrees when Don is released. Bob has his party assemble the weapons but modify all but two of the machine guns by filing the extractors down so they will break after a few rounds are fired and jam the weapons. Meanwhile Nina arrives and sees that the Shiek has not got Don out of the country and instead plans to wipe out the French. Though trusted by the Shiek, Nina proves herself loyal to France by escaping and warning the Legion of the Shiek's proposed attack on a strategic French fort. The Shiek plans his assault with fire support from the two machine guns manned by the legionnaires who are offered their freedom to switch sides. To ensure their loyalty they are covered by the two other machine guns that Bob has sabotaged. As the fort is attacked, the four disgraced Legionnaires turn their machine guns on the Shiek and his horde of insurgents.

Among the civilians killed are the wife and son of LAFD firefighter, Gordy Brewer , who was injured in the explosion as he arrived to pick up his family. Soon afterward, a tape is sent to the U.S. State Department, in which a masked man calling himself ""El Lobo""  claims responsibility for the bombing, explaining it was in retaliation for America's oppression of Colombia. The FBI believes El Lobo is a Colombian terrorist named Claudio Perrini . CIA Special Agent Peter Brandt , the Colombia Station Chief, is harshly reprimanded for the incident by a Senate Oversight Committee, who promptly terminate all CIA operations in Colombia. Brandt angrily returns to Mompós and meets with his paramilitary allies to plan a major offensive to take down Claudio and his guerilla forces. Frustrated at the political red tape regarding the investigation, Brewer also travels to Mompós to personally hunt down Claudio, but is quickly arrested for illegally entering the country. The guerillas stage a prison break to free their fellow members as well as try and abduct Brewer to demand a large ransom for him. Brandt's unit is alerted to Brewer's presence in Colombia, but arrive too late to prevent the prison break. Brewer escapes the prison, avoids being captured, and secures a guerilla zone pass from Canadian mechanic Sean Armstrong  who reveals information into setting him up with drug runner, Felix Ramirez , the manager of the cocaine distribution facility that finances the guerrillas. Pretending to be a mechanic hired to fix a generator, Brewer rigs several improvised explosives and destroys the facility. Felix is blamed for the destruction of the drug plant and is executed in front of a hiding Gordy's eyes. Brewer then infiltrates Claudio's headquarters and plants a bomb to kill him, but is captured when he tries to prevent a woman, later revealed to be Claudio's wife Selena , from being caught in the blast radius. At Claudio's home compound, Selena, who also lost a child in a bombing, empathizes with Brewer's motives and admits that Claudio is planning another bombing in Washington, D.C.. Meanwhile, Brandt's unit locates Claudio's compound and launches an attack. During the ensuing shootout, Selena helps free Brewer and, along with Brandt, travels back to the State Department in Washington, D.C. to help the search effort for Claudio. Selena identifies Union Station as the target, and the FBI go to investigate. On the pretense of using the lavatory, she excuses herself from the command room and becomes irritated when her adopted son Mauro refuses to come with her. Brewer recognizes Selena make the same gesture as the masked man claiming to be El Lobo made in the tape, and realizes that she was ""The Wolf"" all along. Furthermore, Brewer surmises the real target is the State Department. Brewer quickly throws Mauro's toy dinosaur, with the bomb inside of it, out the window moments before it explodes. Brandt is shot and killed in an elevator trying to stop Selena from fleeing the building. Brewer chases Selena to the basement of the building where she and Claudio ride off through the underground tunnels on a motorcycle.

The couples and their families illustrate why overcoming the obstacles to legal nuptials is worthwhile, despite the reality that once back home south of the border, the newlyweds will remain merely 'married in Canada' as their marital status will be unrecognized. The marrying couples also candidly discuss differences in attitude between Americans and Canadians based on their experiences in Canada including human rights, homophobia, openness of society and acceptance of the other. The film also takes an inside view on a Canadian agency catering for cross-border same-sex marriage packages to the United States and other countries.

After his award ceremony, the chief of police is approached by a woman asking for new information about her daughters who went missing 12 years ago. Luis asks the name of her daughters so he can try and find them. The woman tells him that their names are Joy and Lara Luna. Asking his partner to retrieve the missing persons file and despite his colleague, Greg, telling him not to give the woman false hopes, he sets out for his investigation.  Ella  snuck out at night with her cousin Janine  and Brian , Janine's boyfriend to take the car belonging to Janine's mom so that the three could find somewhere quiet to learn to drive better. Ella and Brian are on bad terms because of Brian's alleged cheating on her cousin and are thus always arguing. Brian was teaching Janine how to drive for her driver's test. As the three of them drive on the highway they spot a patrol car. They panic because they don't have drivers licences. Brian tries to make a U-turn, but he accidentally drives into a fence blocking a dirt road. He gets out to check for damage and notices a gate which he opens and then gets back in the car and continues to drive down this isolated road, thinking it would be the perfect spot for them to learn to drive. As the three switch places in the car, they notice a red car which keeps on overtaking them although they never overtook it, they can't work out how it keeps getting behind them. What's worse is they notice that the car doesn't seem to have a driver. Panicking, Brian tries to get them out of the road but are in an endless loop, passing by the same tree again and again. Finally, the car stalls and Brian and Janine gets out of the car but Ella stays behind in the car. Janine tries to convince Brian to go back for her cousin but Brian refuses to do so and instead promises Janine that they will go back for her with help. As the two walk through the woods, they spot a crashed red car. Meanwhile, finally panicking, Ella leaves the car and manages to catch up with the two. Ella manages to call her father and begs for help but are then forced to leave the location and crash site that she told her father about because the car they were waiting beside suddenly bursts into flames. The three run but the two girls are separated from Brian. They manage to get back to their car but a ghost scares Janine, who was behind the wheel. Ella, in a panicked state of mind, accidentally opens her car door and falls out of the car while Janine loses control and hits her head on the wheel. As Ella opens her eyes, she screams upon seeing the ghost of a burned woman looking down at her. A few hours later, Ella's father, Luis and some officers, appear at the same road. They find Brian dead by the corn fields and it is revealed that Janine died when she hit her head on the wheel but they are unable to find Ella. Luis and Officer Allan find a house deep within the woods. Officer Greg tells them that he already searched the house and tells them that Ella isn't there. They also find the crashed car that the three teens passed by earlier. When Luis opens the backseat door, he sees a skeleton wearing a heart shaped locket. The next day, they take the three bodies to the morgue. It is revealed that the skeleton corpse that they found is Lara Luna, whom her mother identified through her locket.  Lara  is driving with her younger sister Joy  on the same dirt road. As they drive, they pass by a teenage boy  walking along the road and a few feet away from him, their car overheats. They get out and then ask him where they can get water and the boy tells them that he'll give them water by his house, which is the same house Luis and the others found years later. As they wait for him outside his house, Lara senses that something is wrong and tells Joy that they should leave. As they try to, the boy comes out and hits them with a wooden stick. Lara wakes up a few hours later, with her foot chained to a bed post. She hears Joy's screams for help and begs him to let her and her sister go. The boy takes Joy down to the basement and proceeds to savagely beat her. A few minutes later, he returns Joy to her room beside her sister's. Lara apologizes to Joy that she couldn't protect her but Joy tells her that it's not her fault. As the boy comes to take Lara, she puts up a fight and scratches his neck. For now, the boy leaves her alone. Lara notices that he dropped the keys to her chains and proceeds to take it. She tries to search for Joy but notices that she's no longer there. She manages to sneak out of the house and falls into a pit which has corpses dumped in it. She sees that one is Joy. As she cries, she apologizes once again and finally leaves. The boy, meanwhile, has taken their car and proceeds to chase Lara with it. Eventually, he gently runs her over. As Lara tries to crawl away, The boy knocks her out and wraps a plastic bag around her head and ties a belt around her neck and her hands. As he drives back to his house, Lara suddenly awakens, causing the boy to crash. He leaves the car and watches it and Lara burn. Back to the present day, Luis takes the officers back to the same house to look for Ella. As he and Officer Allan scope around, they find a picture of the old owners of the house. As Officer Allan goes to search someplace else, Luis finds Ella, who wasn't noticed by Officer Greg. She keeps yelling at him to 'let us go home' and finally passes out as Luis holds her in his arms. Luis takes her to the rendezvous point and takes her to the ambulance. As Ella's father tries to talk to her, she says that their car stalled due to overheating and tells him that they asked a teenage boy for water, revealing that Ella is possessed by Lara. Luis and Officer Allan decide to return to the house.  A young boy  lives with his family in the house deep in the woods. As he looks out of his window, he notices a girl named Martha  looking for his mother. The girl was there to see if the family needed their laundry doing. It is revealed that the boy isn't allowed to come out of the house and his abusive mother Carmela  tells Martha to come back tomorrow morning. Mistaking her son's conversation with Martha as an attempt to go out, Carmela locks him in a cabinet. During the evening, the boy's father , who is a preacher, comes home and lets him out of the cabinet. The reason behind his isolation is because his parents believe that the outside world is full of sin. The reason behind Carmela's bitterness is because the family is struggling financially and her husband refuses to ask money from his congregation. The next day, the boy spots Martha doing their laundry. As he comes down and watches her by the door, she invites him to come out to play but he tells her that he's not allowed to come outside. Wanting him to experience some fun, Martha comes inside with a bucket of soap and they blow bubbles. Carmela comes down and is enraged at the sight. As Martha tries to stop Carmela from hurting the boy, Carmela accidentally knocks her into the door post and Martha dies. As the boy tries to wipe the blood away, he faints. Later that night, the boy wakes up and sees his mother hugging another man. As he comes down, his father tells him to wait upstairs so he and his mother can talk. It is revealed then that Carmela plans to leave her husband and the boy for the man. The boy's father tries to convince her not to do it, but she is stubborn and decides to go through with it. As the boy was listening, he passed out by his bed. The next morning his mother woke him up to have breakfast. When he came downstairs, his father tells him that Carmela left them and his father starts to throw up due to drunkenness. The boy adamantly insists that his mother is still there and in a fit of rage, his father shows him Carmela's corpse, revealing that his father killed Carmela. Frightened, the boy locked himself in the cabinet where he sees Martha's corpse. His father tries to get him out of the cabinet but when he sees Martha's corpse, he is shocked and has a breakdown. The next morning, the boy comes out of the cabinet and when he enters his parents' room, he sees that his father hanged himself. It is revealed that the boy didn't go out of the house until he became a teenager and that the boy was the one who killed Joy and Lara Luna.  Back to the present, Luis and Officer Allan arrive at the house and when Allan finds a room bound with a new padlock, Luis orders him to beat the door down. When he does so, he sees that the room is a bed room. As they look around, Officer Allan notices Luis' medal. Luis knocks him out, wraps his head with a sheet and seals it with a belt around his neck, revealing to the audience that the boys in the second and third parts of the movie was none other than Luis himself. He walks back to the rendezvous point as other cops search the house. As he walks, he keeps on muttering 'I'm sorry, Mama. It won't happen again.' Back at the rendezvous point, Ella's father asks her who was the boy and Ella, still possessed by Lara, points at Luis. As the Chief of Police calls out to him, Luis shoots the chief two times in the chest. He gets in his car and drives away but his car stalls.

After his award ceremony, the chief of police is approached by a woman asking for new information about her daughters who went missing 12 years ago. Luis asks the name of her daughters so he can try and find them. The woman tells him that their names are Joy and Lara Luna. Asking his partner to retrieve the missing persons file and despite his colleague, Greg, telling him not to give the woman false hopes, he sets out for his investigation.  Ella  snuck out at night with her cousin Janine  and Brian , Janine's boyfriend to take the car belonging to Janine's mom so that the three could find somewhere quiet to learn to drive better. Ella and Brian are on bad terms because of Brian's alleged cheating on her cousin and are thus always arguing. Brian was teaching Janine how to drive for her driver's test. As the three of them drive on the highway they spot a patrol car. They panic because they don't have drivers licences. Brian tries to make a U-turn, but he accidentally drives into a fence blocking a dirt road. He gets out to check for damage and notices a gate which he opens and then gets back in the car and continues to drive down this isolated road, thinking it would be the perfect spot for them to learn to drive. As the three switch places in the car, they notice a red car which keeps on overtaking them although they never overtook it, they can't work out how it keeps getting behind them. What's worse is they notice that the car doesn't seem to have a driver. Panicking, Brian tries to get them out of the road but are in an endless loop, passing by the same tree again and again. Finally, the car stalls and Brian and Janine gets out of the car but Ella stays behind in the car. Janine tries to convince Brian to go back for her cousin but Brian refuses to do so and instead promises Janine that they will go back for her with help. As the two walk through the woods, they spot a crashed red car. Meanwhile, finally panicking, Ella leaves the car and manages to catch up with the two. Ella manages to call her father and begs for help but are then forced to leave the location and crash site that she told her father about because the car they were waiting beside suddenly bursts into flames. The three run but the two girls are separated from Brian. They manage to get back to their car but a ghost scares Janine, who was behind the wheel. Ella, in a panicked state of mind, accidentally opens her car door and falls out of the car while Janine loses control and hits her head on the wheel. As Ella opens her eyes, she screams upon seeing the ghost of a burned woman looking down at her. A few hours later, Ella's father, Luis and some officers, appear at the same road. They find Brian dead by the corn fields and it is revealed that Janine died when she hit her head on the wheel but they are unable to find Ella. Luis and Officer Allan find a house deep within the woods. Officer Greg tells them that he already searched the house and tells them that Ella isn't there. They also find the crashed car that the three teens passed by earlier. When Luis opens the backseat door, he sees a skeleton wearing a heart shaped locket. The next day, they take the three bodies to the morgue. It is revealed that the skeleton corpse that they found is Lara Luna, whom her mother identified through her locket.  Lara  is driving with her younger sister Joy  on the same dirt road. As they drive, they pass by a teenage boy  walking along the road and a few feet away from him, their car overheats. They get out and then ask him where they can get water and the boy tells them that he'll give them water by his house, which is the same house Luis and the others found years later. As they wait for him outside his house, Lara senses that something is wrong and tells Joy that they should leave. As they try to, the boy comes out and hits them with a wooden stick. Lara wakes up a few hours later, with her foot chained to a bed post. She hears Joy's screams for help and begs him to let her and her sister go. The boy takes Joy down to the basement and proceeds to savagely beat her. A few minutes later, he returns Joy to her room beside her sister's. Lara apologizes to Joy that she couldn't protect her but Joy tells her that it's not her fault. As the boy comes to take Lara, she puts up a fight and scratches his neck. For now, the boy leaves her alone. Lara notices that he dropped the keys to her chains and proceeds to take it. She tries to search for Joy but notices that she's no longer there. She manages to sneak out of the house and falls into a pit which has corpses dumped in it. She sees that one is Joy. As she cries, she apologizes once again and finally leaves. The boy, meanwhile, has taken their car and proceeds to chase Lara with it. Eventually, he gently runs her over. As Lara tries to crawl away, The boy knocks her out and wraps a plastic bag around her head and ties a belt around her neck and her hands. As he drives back to his house, Lara suddenly awakens, causing the boy to crash. He leaves the car and watches it and Lara burn. Back to the present day, Luis takes the officers back to the same house to look for Ella. As he and Officer Allan scope around, they find a picture of the old owners of the house. As Officer Allan goes to search someplace else, Luis finds Ella, who wasn't noticed by Officer Greg. She keeps yelling at him to 'let us go home' and finally passes out as Luis holds her in his arms. Luis takes her to the rendezvous point and takes her to the ambulance. As Ella's father tries to talk to her, she says that their car stalled due to overheating and tells him that they asked a teenage boy for water, revealing that Ella is possessed by Lara. Luis and Officer Allan decide to return to the house.  A young boy  lives with his family in the house deep in the woods. As he looks out of his window, he notices a girl named Martha  looking for his mother. The girl was there to see if the family needed their laundry doing. It is revealed that the boy isn't allowed to come out of the house and his abusive mother Carmela  tells Martha to come back tomorrow morning. Mistaking her son's conversation with Martha as an attempt to go out, Carmela locks him in a cabinet. During the evening, the boy's father , who is a preacher, comes home and lets him out of the cabinet. The reason behind his isolation is because his parents believe that the outside world is full of sin. The reason behind Carmela's bitterness is because the family is struggling financially and her husband refuses to ask money from his congregation. The next day, the boy spots Martha doing their laundry. As he comes down and watches her by the door, she invites him to come out to play but he tells her that he's not allowed to come outside. Wanting him to experience some fun, Martha comes inside with a bucket of soap and they blow bubbles. Carmela comes down and is enraged at the sight. As Martha tries to stop Carmela from hurting the boy, Carmela accidentally knocks her into the door post and Martha dies. As the boy tries to wipe the blood away, he faints. Later that night, the boy wakes up and sees his mother hugging another man. As he comes down, his father tells him to wait upstairs so he and his mother can talk. It is revealed then that Carmela plans to leave her husband and the boy for the man. The boy's father tries to convince her not to do it, but she is stubborn and decides to go through with it. As the boy was listening, he passed out by his bed. The next morning his mother woke him up to have breakfast. When he came downstairs, his father tells him that Carmela left them and his father starts to throw up due to drunkenness. The boy adamantly insists that his mother is still there and in a fit of rage, his father shows him Carmela's corpse, revealing that his father killed Carmela. Frightened, the boy locked himself in the cabinet where he sees Martha's corpse. His father tries to get him out of the cabinet but when he sees Martha's corpse, he is shocked and has a breakdown. The next morning, the boy comes out of the cabinet and when he enters his parents' room, he sees that his father hanged himself. It is revealed that the boy didn't go out of the house until he became a teenager and that the boy was the one who killed Joy and Lara Luna.  Back to the present, Luis and Officer Allan arrive at the house and when Allan finds a room bound with a new padlock, Luis orders him to beat the door down. When he does so, he sees that the room is a bed room. As they look around, Officer Allan notices Luis' medal. Luis knocks him out, wraps his head with a sheet and seals it with a belt around his neck, revealing to the audience that the boys in the second and third parts of the movie was none other than Luis himself. He walks back to the rendezvous point as other cops search the house. As he walks, he keeps on muttering 'I'm sorry, Mama. It won't happen again.' Back at the rendezvous point, Ella's father asks her who was the boy and Ella, still possessed by Lara, points at Luis. As the Chief of Police calls out to him, Luis shoots the chief two times in the chest. He gets in his car and drives away but his car stalls. As he tries to get out, the ghosts of Joy and Lara are with him in his car. He reaches for his gun and it is shown that Lara is forcing his hand to point his gun to his chin. As he mutters 'Mama, I'm sorry', Lara forces him to shoot himself. A few minutes later, the other cops find Luis in his car, dead. The film ends with Luis as a young boy, finally able to go outside of his house and be free from his mother.

Seth Karamchand  gets a telegram. Chandu, his man servant brings it to him and Sethji is extremely happy. Seeing his happiness Chandu asks : Chandu : Is it from Chhote Babu? Sethji : Yes. He has reached Bombay and will be coming here tomorrow. Chandu rushes to the market to buy baingan  for Baingan ka bharta and other favourite vegetables of Chhote Babu. Chandu is very sure that Chhote Babu will still savour his Chutneys and Bharta. The scene shifts to another house. Husband is sitting and reading newspaper. Wife, Sharda  comes screaming into the room calling her servants but none of them seem to be around. Sharda : Suniye, sun rahe hai aap? Jijaji : Ji, boliye. Sharda : Main kab se chila rahi hoon aur aap par asar hi nahin hota. chup chap akhbaar padhe jaa rahe hain.  Jijaji : Aap kahe toh bhool ho gayi, main chilla ke akhbaar padna shuru kar deta hoon.  And he literally starts reading the paper loud. Sharda is a very dominating wife and hardly lets her husband speak. In case if he does get to voice his opinion, she screams : “Aap chup rahiye!” And he obediently replies : “Aap kahe toh bhool ho gayi!” Everybody descends from the flight but they can’t spot Ashok anywhere. So concluding that Ashok didn’t come by that flight, the party returns back home. Sharda knows that Ashok is coming back after 5 years in Europe. He’s the only son of Seth Karamchand, the richest man around. So she feels he’s the most eligible boy in town for her sister, Kavita . Sharda wants Kavita to accompany her and go to receive Ashok at the airport but Kavita refuses because she is of a different opinion. She gives 2 reasons to justify her denial : 1. Mujhe abhi shaadi nahin karni . 2. Ameer baap ke bete se mujhe saqt nafrat hai. Siwaye apne baap ke tukde todna use kuch nahin aata . So off they go to the airport without Kavita. Sethji, Sharda and Jijaji are waiting at the airport and the plane’s landing. Sethji is very excited and says – I’m going to see my son after 5 years. Wonder how much he must have changed and grown. Jijaji : He must have grown by 5 years now, of course! He says that as a matter of fact and with so much of enthu. Kavita and her group of friends are on their way to college when a car passes by splashing slush on Kavita. But the gentleman, Ashok , behind the wheels drives back when he realizes what he has done. But before he can say anything the girls begin scolding him: Starting with Kavita : Junglee, Jaanwar!!! Her friends ask him : Do you drive with your eyese closed? You think that this road is your father’s property? Ashok : I’m so sorry. Kavita : Your sorry wont clean my saree He offers to take her home where she could change and then would drop her to her college. But her friends misunderstand him and tell her : He looks like a goon. He’ll first find out where you live, then the college where you study and thenwill ask for your name. His intentions don’t look good. Enough is enough. He can’t take it any more. So much for his decency! So he offers her some money and tells her to get her saree dry cleaned/washed or get a new one… She retorts : Keep the money to yourself. Buy some wit and good manners if you come across any. That will at least make you a little human. Ashok goes to a garage  and calls out for DeSuza. Somebody answers that he’s dead. Next, he calls for Decruz and the same voice replies that he’s dead too. Finally, he calls for Fernandes and Fernandes crawls out from under a car saying : Zinda hai . It turns out that Ashok and Fernandes were school buddies but Fernandes wasn’t interested in studies. So his uncle took him under his wing and taught him the trick of the trade and gave him a job in his garage. He concludes saying – Apni toh yeh life hai bhaiya aur abhi tak without wife hai . Fernandes fixes his car and off he goes. He reaches home and his father is pretty annoyed that he didn’t inform him that he wasn’t coming by flight, knowing that he would go to the airport to receive him. But one look of regret from his son and the father melts. Ashok explains that his friend, Shamu asked him to drive home instead of taking the flight. Hence, he took his car and came over. They sit down to dine, on a huge dining table and they sit at opposite ends. They can’t even see each other directly, the lamp comes in between and they keep bending on opposite sides while talking so that one is visible to the other. The next day he goes out and sees Kavita and her friends at a petrol pump. He overhears them mention putting up at Ashok Hotel. He follows them. And they all shower him with the same gaalis again calling him Aawara, Loafer, Badmaash, Junglee etc. He accepts that he spoiled her saree that day but even they punctured his tyre, so it’s not fair to label only him a budtameez. Ashok : For your kind information I’m a good decent guy and will prove it to you when the time comes. In the mean time, during the conversation he manages to poke their tyre with something, leaving them behind with a flat tyre. He drives ahead and when he realizes that they have stopped their car, he gets down and offers some suggestions but nobody wants them. He worries them all the more by singing Yun na dekho hume baar baar. Finally Kavita and group reach Ashok Hotel and they declare they are from Sharda college but the Manager apologizes saying he couldn’t book a room for them as all the rooms are already filled. They all get worried because it’s dark already and they don’t know the place. They request the Manager to arrange for something but he says there isn’t anything much he can do. But if they would go and talk to the owner, they might get a room if their luck favours them because there are rooms reserved for the owners. Kavita, the leader of the group goes to speak to the owner. But when she realizes it’s Ashok she just walks out. But her friends are in no mood of going and searching for another place to spend the night. So they try convincing Ashok. They literally corner him. But he strikes a deal that he would give them a room provided their leader, Kavita comes and requests for it! Pehle apne langoor jaisa shakal toh dekhe! Main request karoon?!!! – This is her reaction when she hears of the deal. But when her friends emotionally blackmail her into arranging an accommodation for them, she gives in and reqests Ashok to give them a room, which he immediately does. The following morning Sethji also turns up at the hotel demanding the Manager for Book of Accounts. When he learns that Ashok’s there, he goes to his room. Kavita and group happen to be at the counter. Manager confides in them that Sethji is very short tempered. This gives her an idea to get Ashok into trouble. So she sends her friends one my one to Ashok’s room, all of them claiming to be his girlfriends. After the first one leaves, Ashok explains to his father that she’s gone crazy. But when this continues, Sethji : You mean to say all these girls have gone crazy? Ashok :It is possible Sethji : Or think think I’ve gone crazy to believe you? He orders Ashok to pack his bag immediately and leave with him.It’s Ashok’s birthday and Sharda and Jijaji are getting ready for the party. Sharda wants Kavita to accomany them but Kavita refuses. Jijaji convinces her to join them and finally she gives in and goes with them to Sethji’s house. But the best part it she doesn’t know that her Badmaash, Junglee, Budtameez is the birthday boy. She’s quite surprised to find him even there. And ignores him as much as she can even after learning he’s Sethji’s son. Ashok then falls for her although she hates him . Kavita’s sister is already bent on fixing her marriage to Ashok, but Kavita doesn’t want to marry a rich guy who lives on “his father’s crumbs”—which she also tells Ashok. Ashok is not about to give up just because the girl doesn’t like him. He asks his friend Fernandes  for a job as a mechanic in his garage, explaining that he needs to get a new image. Somehow he manages to convince Kavita that he is Mohan the mechanic, not Ashok the rich loafer. They fall in love, although Ashok continues to annoy Kavita as himself too. Kavita is distressed when her sister insists on fixing her marriage to Ashok, and tells her she will only marry Mohan. Her sister is unimpressed with this idea. Naturally when his deception is eventually uncovered, Kavita is quite angry. He points out that she’s loved him by one name and hated him by another, but that he’s the same person beneath the names. Subsequently they get engaged. Ashok is invited to a school friend’s wedding, but soon after his arrival the groom’s father is told about a scandal from the bride’s past  and he cancels the wedding. Ashok pleads with them on the bride’s behalf. Ashok marries the bride, Sheila, to save her and her family from dishonor. He gets married without even seeing the girl and then takes her home and goes. But Sethji isn’t very pleased with him for what he has done. He kicks him out of the house. So Ashok goes back to the garage and lives there with his wife, Sheila .Sharda and Jijaji are shocked to hear the news. Kavita blames him for cheating on her. Ashok wanders along singing Main bewafa nahin hoon tere pyaar ki kasam. But Jijaji tells her it’s not fair to reach a conclusion without knowing the entire truth. So she sets out to find the truth. She goes to Ashok’s house and meets Sheila. And the poor soul pours her heart out to her. He keeps repeating his belief that Sheila made one mistake, and why should she have to suffer the rest of her life for it? He says this to his father as well when he brings his new wife home, but his father is enraged and throws them out of the house. Ashok takes Sheila to his old digs at the garage, and they settle in to make a new life. But what about Kavita? What will she do? Can Ashok live in poverty after growing up in great wealth? Kavita feels guilty for accusing Ashok of infidelity. She sings O {{not a typo}} mana mere meet. Kavita still loves Ashok  but Ashok comes in terms with his life. He accepts that it was not in his fate to marry Kavita and is content with what he has got. He tries his best to forget his past and to start his life afresh with Sheila. Even her past doesn’t bother him. He doesn’t blame her for coming in between him and Kavita but accepts her whole-heartedly and does his best to be a good husband. So what next??? What happens to Kavita? Ashok and Sheila are quite happily married. What will happen to this love triangle? Will Sethji finally accept Sheila as his daughter-in-law? Will Sharda ever forgive Ashok for what he has done to Kavita?The first half a light-hearted romantic comedy and the second half is about the double standard adopted for women, with Ashok the voice of reason and “modern” thinking.

Seth Karamchand  gets a telegram. Chandu, his man servant brings it to him and Sethji is extremely happy. Seeing his happiness Chandu asks : Chandu : Is it from Chhote Babu? Sethji : Yes. He has reached Bombay and will be coming here tomorrow. Chandu rushes to the market to buy baingan  for Baingan ka bharta and other favourite vegetables of Chhote Babu. Chandu is very sure that Chhote Babu will still savour his Chutneys and Bharta. The scene shifts to another house. Husband is sitting and reading newspaper. Wife, Sharda  comes screaming into the room calling her servants but none of them seem to be around. Sharda : Suniye, sun rahe hai aap? Jijaji : Ji, boliye. Sharda : Main kab se chila rahi hoon aur aap par asar hi nahin hota. chup chap akhbaar padhe jaa rahe hain.  Jijaji : Aap kahe toh bhool ho gayi, main chilla ke akhbaar padna shuru kar deta hoon.  And he literally starts reading the paper loud. Sharda is a very dominating wife and hardly lets her husband speak. In case if he does get to voice his opinion, she screams : “Aap chup rahiye!” And he obediently replies : “Aap kahe toh bhool ho gayi!” Everybody descends from the flight but they can’t spot Ashok anywhere. So concluding that Ashok didn’t come by that flight, the party returns back home. Sharda knows that Ashok is coming back after 5 years in Europe. He’s the only son of Seth Karamchand, the richest man around. So she feels he’s the most eligible boy in town for her sister, Kavita . Sharda wants Kavita to accompany her and go to receive Ashok at the airport but Kavita refuses because she is of a different opinion. She gives 2 reasons to justify her denial : 1. Mujhe abhi shaadi nahin karni . 2. Ameer baap ke bete se mujhe saqt nafrat hai. Siwaye apne baap ke tukde todna use kuch nahin aata . So off they go to the airport without Kavita. Sethji, Sharda and Jijaji are waiting at the airport and the plane’s landing. Sethji is very excited and says – I’m going to see my son after 5 years. Wonder how much he must have changed and grown. Jijaji : He must have grown by 5 years now, of course! He says that as a matter of fact and with so much of enthu. Kavita and her group of friends are on their way to college when a car passes by splashing slush on Kavita. But the gentleman, Ashok , behind the wheels drives back when he realizes what he has done. But before he can say anything the girls begin scolding him: Starting with Kavita : Junglee, Jaanwar!!! Her friends ask him : Do you drive with your eyese closed? You think that this road is your father’s property? Ashok : I’m so sorry. Kavita : Your sorry wont clean my saree He offers to take her home where she could change and then would drop her to her college. But her friends misunderstand him and tell her : He looks like a goon. He’ll first find out where you live, then the college where you study and thenwill ask for your name. His intentions don’t look good. Enough is enough. He can’t take it any more. So much for his decency! So he offers her some money and tells her to get her saree dry cleaned/washed or get a new one… She retorts : Keep the money to yourself. Buy some wit and good manners if you come across any. That will at least make you a little human. Ashok goes to a garage  and calls out for DeSuza. Somebody answers that he’s dead. Next, he calls for Decruz and the same voice replies that he’s dead too. Finally, he calls for Fernandes and Fernandes crawls out from under a car saying : Zinda hai . It turns out that Ashok and Fernandes were school buddies but Fernandes wasn’t interested in studies. So his uncle took him under his wing and taught him the trick of the trade and gave him a job in his garage. He concludes saying – Apni toh yeh life hai bhaiya aur abhi tak without wife hai . Fernandes fixes his car and off he goes. He reaches home and his father is pretty annoyed that he didn’t inform him that he wasn’t coming by flight, knowing that he would go to the airport to receive him. But one look of regret from his son and the father melts. Ashok explains that his friend, Shamu asked him to drive home instead of taking the flight. Hence, he took his car and came over. They sit down to dine, on a huge dining table and they sit at opposite ends. They can’t even see each other directly, the lamp comes in between and they keep bending on opposite sides while talking so that one is visible to the other. The next day he goes out and sees Kavita and her friends at a petrol pump. He overhears them mention putting up at Ashok Hotel. He follows them. And they all shower him with the same gaalis again calling him Aawara, Loafer, Badmaash, Junglee etc. He accepts that he spoiled her saree that day but even they punctured his tyre, so it’s not fair to label only him a budtameez. Ashok : For your kind information I’m a good decent guy and will prove it to you when the time comes. In the mean time, during the conversation he manages to poke their tyre with something, leaving them behind with a flat tyre. He drives ahead and when he realizes that they have stopped their car, he gets down and offers some suggestions but nobody wants them. He worries them all the more by singing Yun na dekho hume baar baar. Finally Kavita and group reach Ashok Hotel and they declare they are from Sharda college but the Manager apologizes saying he couldn’t book a room for them as all the rooms are already filled. They all get worried because it’s dark already and they don’t know the place. They request the Manager to arrange for something but he says there isn’t anything much he can do. But if they would go and talk to the owner, they might get a room if their luck favours them because there are rooms reserved for the owners. Kavita, the leader of the group goes to speak to the owner. But when she realizes it’s Ashok she just walks out.

Inside the briefcase is a top-secret virus called ""Golden Snow"", which was being experimented on the planet Leslie. As communications to Leslie have failed, Tetsu is assigned to travel to the planet to investigate while the other Dekarangers scout around for leads on the Gas Drinkers' whereabouts. Ban and Jasmine enter a nightclub, where Ban meets Marie Gold, a beautiful singer with the ability to temporarily stop time. She also reveals herself as an undercover SPD officer from Leslie. It is revealed that the Gas Drinkers released the Golden Snow virus on Leslie, turning the planet's population into machine slaves. Marie is the only survivor, as she was on patrol duty outside the planet. The gang's intention was to infect planets with the virus before selling the vaccine to them for a high price with the help of Agent Abrella; however, their plans were complicated by the Dekarangers' intervention upon their arrival on Earth. Later, Marie uses her time-stopping power to steal the virus from Swan-san's laboratory, as she had made a deal with the Gas Drinkers to exchange it for the vaccine to save her planet. After Jasmine uses her ESPer abilities to track Marie's whereabouts, the Dekarangers head to an abandoned warehouse outside town to stop the exchange from happening. While Ban confronts Marie over her sense of justice, the Gas Drinkers' leader Volger injects her with the full dose of the virus, telling the Dekarangers that she will fall violently ill and spread it all over Earth in an hour unless they pay 10 billion for the vaccine. Marie pleads to Ban to kill her in order to prevent the virus from spreading, but he promises to recover the vaccine and save her. After Murphy takes Marie back to Deka Base, the Dekarangers have the Gas Drinkers approved for deletion. Deka Blue destroys Whinsky, while Deka Yellow and Deka Pink eliminate Gene and Deka Green takes down Brandyl. Deka Red engages Volger in a gun fight, but finds himself cornered when the Alienizer cheats by using an energy attack on him. Deka Master suddenly appears from an SPD helicopter and intervenes, giving Deka Red an opportunity to chase after Volger while he cuts down three Igaroids with the Vega Slash. Deka Red defeats Volger and recovers the vaccine before throwing it to Deka Master, who heads back to Deka Base. However, Volger recovers and teleports to Leslie to prepare his machine slaves for an invasion of Earth. Dekaranger Robo arrives on Leslie to stop Volger, but is pummeled by his Heavy Industrial Machine Killer Tank. A Blast Buggy driven by Deka Break arrives to intervene and combine with Dekaranger Robo to form Dekaranger Robo Full Blast Custom to cut down Volger's machine slave army and destroy Killer Tank. The next day, a fully recovered Marie bids farewell to the Dekarangers, as she is on her way to return to Leslie with the vaccine. Before she leaves, she stops time to give Ban a flower and a kiss, hoping to see him again soon."

Amit doesn’t see why they have to get married and wants to keep things as they are. Wedding dates are set and then moved, to her great frustration.This is really their only point of discord.Amit lives alone, and is also very fond of Chhaya’s family: father , mother , little brother Raju and sister Maya .It is Diwali, and as children burst crackers and set off potentially limb-severing fireworks, Amit’s upstairs neighbor Raman  has been watching a group of men in a tent just outside the building’s courtyard. They also appear to be keeping tabs on him, and have his manservant in their pay. Now Raman tosses furniture about the room and loads a pistol and then takes a body out of a trunk, lays it out on the floor, sprinkles it with whiskey and as another set of firecrackers explode outside, he shoots the poor dead guy’s face off. When Amit returns home, Raman is waiting for him and forces his way in. He explains to Amit that he is a spy for India and that he is being watched by enemy agents . He has set up his own suicide  to throw the enemies off his trail and needs to stay with Amit for a few days in hiding. The unnamed enemy is plotting to destroy India’s valuable relationship with an African country called Mazaland by assassinating its Chief Minister when he arrives November 19 at the Delhi International Airport.Raman wants to wait until his enemies hear of his “suicide” and depart before he sets off for Delhi to stop the assassination himself. He shaves his beard and dons thick black glasses to disguise himself and Amit reluctantly agrees to let him stay for a few days.The enemy agents are not put off by the sensational news of Raman’s suicide and stay put themselves. The next day Raman pries the back off his watch; hidden behind the watch face is a teeny-tiny red notebook. He opens it up and begins writing.Amit is meanwhile visiting Chhaya and her family again to talk about wedding details.Amit indulges in room talk with Chaya's family. Chhaya's family is a close & warm family.But when Aman returns home, he gets a shock.Raman has been murdered and Amit’s living room turned upside down, and the men in the tent outside have disappeared.

In the sugar jar is the not-as-teeny-tiny-as-it-used-to-be red notebook, hidden by Raman.Raman has written down some clues about the gang  and their plan to kill the Chief Minister of Mazaland. He begs Amit to stop them himself: to take the notebook with him to Delhi and hand it over to the police there. Although it was pitch-dark outside moments ago, Amit looks out the window and the sun is shining brightly as the dudhwala approaches on his bicycle. Amit takes off his own clothes very skillfully underneath a towel, and gives the milkman money for his dhoti-kurta—which he somewhat unwillingly gives up.And so Amit’s endless journey of swapping outfits and changing clothes begins. The poor milkman finds the grim scene in Amit’s living room and calls the police.The police naturally assume that Amit is the culprit and put out an all-points bulletin for his arrest. The rest of the story is full of suspense. Will he make it to Delhi in time? Will he find the enemy’s camp and manage to stop the assassination? Can India possibly survive the severing of ties with Mazaland if he doesn’t? Who is the real brains behind this plot, anyway? And will he ever set a wedding date with Chhaya?

After interrogating the three Abarangers, the Dekarangers are ordered to bring them to the Deka Room, where they are all briefed on the shape-shifting Ginjifuan Kazak. The Abarangers explain that they were contacted by a curry shop owner friend of theirs who is being targeted by Kazak; hence their short battle with Kazak, who changed into a raven and fled while the Abarangers were arrested. Despite Doggie Kruger's suggestion to investigate the curry shop, both Super Sentai groups get into a heated argument over their methods of justice. However, when Yukito discovers a weak spot on Doggie's back and uses his chiropractic skills to fix it, Doggie suggests for Ban to team up with Ryoga. Meanwhile, at a meeting with Kazak, Agent Abrella breaks open a red orb to unleash Trinoid #0 Saunaginnan, who had been sealed away by Mikela as he was deemed too powerful. Saunaginnan demonstrates his power by reviving the previously deleted Reversian Succubus and Speckionian Genio. However, Saunaginnan quickly wears out his energy, as he is missing two gingko nut batteries that power his abilities. Kazak takes the two revived Alienizers to retrieve the gingko nuts, giving each of them a piece of the shattered orb. Ban and Ryoga arrive at Dino House, which has grown to become the country's largest curry shop. There, they meet the Trinoid Yatsudenwani, who has replaced Mr. Sugishita as the president of the restaurant chain. He explains to the duo that he had kept the orb that contained Saunaginnan when it was stolen, but he reveals that he has the two gingko nuts. Kazak suddenly appears and attacks Yatsudenwani before Deka Red and Aba Red interfere. However, during the fight, the clock strikes 11:00 and Aba Red suddenly leaves the fight to make a phone call to his niece Mai, who is currently taking up acting classes in Hollywood. This causes Kazak to defeat the two warriors and leave with the gingko nuts, announcing his plans to resurrect all of the deleted Alienizers and Dezumozorlya. Meanwhile, Succubus and Genio wreak havoc in two different places in town. Deka Blue, Deka Green and Deka Break assume they can easily defeat Genio by hitting his chest, but to no effect. Abare Blue pinpoints a weakness in his third vertebra, enabling the four warriors to once again delete him. Jasmine, Umeko and Ranru prepare to battle Succubus, but the Alienizer spits out a gel that clogs up their transformation devices. After distracting Succubus with some cosplaying tactics, Ranru finds a formula to dissolve the gel, enabling all three to transform and defeat Succubus. Both Genio and Succubus are reduced to the orb chunks that were in their possession. Deka Red and Aba Red once again face Kazak, but they both end up fighting each other over Aba Red's phone call. While Kazak's platoon of Anaroids massage him, Aba Red explains to Deka Red that he made a promise to call Mai before her audition. This gives Kazak the opportunity to throw both red warriors off the building. However, some last-minute teamwork brings them both back in the fight, which is suddenly interrupted by Asuka playing his harmonica. Enraged by the presence of evil on Another Earth, Abare Black attacks Kazak, who is then forced to retreat into the orb chunk he carries. Meanwhile, at a cave, Saunaginnan becomes fully charged, causing the orb chunks to glow into a trail while Earth becomes engulfed in a thick fog. The Dekarangers and Abarangers follow the trail, but are confronted by Kazak and Saunaginnan, with the revived Ben-G, Milibar and Bon-Goblin and an army of Anaroids. Kazak sends the heroes in confusion by shape-shifting into Numa-O and Hurricane Red. The fog gets thicker as the door to hell opens in the sky, but as everyone anticipates the arrival of Dezumozorlya, out come Mikoto Nakadai and TopGaler instead. After Doggie enters the fight, both Dekarangers and Abarangers shuffle members to defeat the revived Alienizers. The heroes then use the D-Bazooka and Superior Dino Bomber to delete Kazak and Saunaginnan. Kazak, however, dodges the blast and boards his Heavy Industrial Machine PalletteView while Saunaginnan is resurrected into a giant. Super Dekaranger Robo and Killer AbarenOh destroy the two giants with a combined Gatling Punch and Gatling Drill Spin attack. As a side-effect of defeating Saunaginnan, Mikoto must return to the afterlife, but not before telling Asuka to give his regards to his daughter. Back at Deka Base, the Dekarangers and Abarangers celebrate their victory with a party hosted by Yatsudenwani, who irritates the Dekarangers with his singing. It is later on revealed that Doggie was one of Dino House's regular customers. Meanwhile, the girls and Emiri enjoy a bubble bath before Yatsudenwani barges in. They chase him around the Deka Room before everyone stops to have a group photo taken.

Abare Blue pinpoints a weakness in his third vertebra, enabling the four warriors to once again delete him. Jasmine, Umeko and Ranru prepare to battle Succubus, but the Alienizer spits out a gel that clogs up their transformation devices. After distracting Succubus with some cosplaying tactics, Ranru finds a formula to dissolve the gel, enabling all three to transform and defeat Succubus. Both Genio and Succubus are reduced to the orb chunks that were in their possession. Deka Red and Aba Red once again face Kazak, but they both end up fighting each other over Aba Red's phone call. While Kazak's platoon of Anaroids massage him, Aba Red explains to Deka Red that he made a promise to call Mai before her audition. This gives Kazak the opportunity to throw both red warriors off the building. However, some last-minute teamwork brings them both back in the fight, which is suddenly interrupted by Asuka playing his harmonica. Enraged by the presence of evil on Another Earth, Abare Black attacks Kazak, who is then forced to retreat into the orb chunk he carries. Meanwhile, at a cave, Saunaginnan becomes fully charged, causing the orb chunks to glow into a trail while Earth becomes engulfed in a thick fog. The Dekarangers and Abarangers follow the trail, but are confronted by Kazak and Saunaginnan, with the revived Ben-G, Milibar and Bon-Goblin and an army of Anaroids. Kazak sends the heroes in confusion by shape-shifting into Numa-O and Hurricane Red. The fog gets thicker as the door to hell opens in the sky, but as everyone anticipates the arrival of Dezumozorlya, out come Mikoto Nakadai and TopGaler instead. After Doggie enters the fight, both Dekarangers and Abarangers shuffle members to defeat the revived Alienizers. The heroes then use the D-Bazooka and Superior Dino Bomber to delete Kazak and Saunaginnan. Kazak, however, dodges the blast and boards his Heavy Industrial Machine PalletteView while Saunaginnan is resurrected into a giant. Super Dekaranger Robo and Killer AbarenOh destroy the two giants with a combined Gatling Punch and Gatling Drill Spin attack. As a side-effect of defeating Saunaginnan, Mikoto must return to the afterlife, but not before telling Asuka to give his regards to his daughter. Back at Deka Base, the Dekarangers and Abarangers celebrate their victory with a party hosted by Yatsudenwani, who irritates the Dekarangers with his singing. It is later on revealed that Doggie was one of Dino House's regular customers. Meanwhile, the girls and Emiri enjoy a bubble bath before Yatsudenwani barges in. They chase him around the Deka Room before everyone stops to have a group photo taken.

His murder is followed by the murder of a nurse of the same hospital at the same time, 3:00 am. Investigator Vijay  is assigned the duty of finding the killer. During his investigation, Vijay meets Dr. Suhani , who was the first one to find the body of the nurse. Suhani believes that something supernatural is committing the murders, but Vijay doesn't believe her theory. Another doctor of the hospital is murdered the same way, followed by the murder of an office boy by a lady, who was helping doctors in the operation theater a few minutes before his death. It is then revealed that one more person - a hospital intern, Mary  has been missing. Vijay also discovers that he suffered from memory loss, which was an outcome of an accident he had some time ago. However, he remembers that he and Mary were together in an adventure show before he suffered the accident. Suhani maintains that there is a supernatural spirit who is not being addressed. Though Vijay continues not to believe her, he finally starts seeing visions from his past that help him recover his lost memory. It is then revealed that Mary had been the girl Vijay was in love with. The two had gotten married in a church after Vijay's father gave permission. Just as the two left the church, they were attacked by a group of unknown men. Vijay tried to fight back, but was hit on the head by a rod, leading to his partial memory loss.

What counts for her is a loving family! She is not yet married and usually wakes up alone in the morning, but this fact has not turned her into a desperate lady hanging on the arm of every encountered guy. On the contrary, just like Bridget Jones she believes that there's her second half waiting for her somewhere in this big city and that true love can happen. * Mikołaj - a romantic who with skill and charm of Hugh Grant seduces women mainly on air! In real life it all looks a bit different. His greatest asset is his specific sense of humor and a deep male voice, stimulating the imagination of listeners who absolutely love it. * Wladi - many men would like to have his pugnacity and light approach to life. His charm and magic air works for women as an aphrodisiac. He can surprise with an unusual proposition, and in restaurants always foots the bill. It's just that no woman yet has succeeded to ensnare him. Will he finally find someone who discovers the key to his heart? * Melchior vel Mel Gibson - s testosterone ebullient amateur and admirer of feminine beauty. As hardly anyone works in Ars Amandi.

It turns out, though that even the ice queen carries a great need for love in her heart. * Wojciech - perfect husband, it seems: calm, tolerant, wise. In addition, he knows his wines, and the oldest people do not remember that his wife said ""no."" Boredom. But even though under the thumb, to his own surprise, he is able to go beyond the rigid framework of routine when something or someone will awake deep hidden longing and feelings. * Betty - wherever she appears, all eyes directed only at her. She could have any guy, but the most important is her mysterious Kazik. Who is the man for whom she decided to change her whole life? * Larwa - wouldn't be a bad bridesmaid material if only her best friend - Doris married. Larwa from a friend's perspective can enjoy a delightful vision of a successful relationship. She never gives up and can support her lost friend. Her twisted sense of humor works better than Doris's anti-stress mask."

His children refused to confront it, except for David, the filmmaker, for whom it became a compass for a long journey. When he found it unbearable to be alone in the wake of his father's survival story and his struggle not to lose his sanity, David convinced his brothers and sister to join him in the hope that this would also contribute to releasing tensions and making them as close as they used to be. They, for their part, couldn’t understand why anyone should want to dig into the past instead of enjoying life in the present.

However, suspecting that Murat is gay and believing that his Turkish background makes him lesser of a person, some boys from Murat’s school harass and beat him. Meanwhile, Lola, a Turkish male who dresses as a female, argues with his boyfriend, a “macho” Turkish male named Bilidikid , about returning to Turkey. Billy wants Lola to get a sex reassignment  and move with him, but Lola refuses, knowing that if he had the surgery, Billy would leave him. After discovering that Lola is his brother who was disowned by Osman and their father for being gay, Murat runs away from home and meets Lola in the bar in which he works. The two begin to develop a relationship, but Lola mysteriously disappears, leaving Murat at the mercy of Billy, who uses Murat in his business of earning money for receiving oral intercourse. Soon thereafter, Lola is discovered dead in a river. Billy convinces Murat that he knows who killed Lola, but thinks that they need to take the matter into their own hands rather than letting the police deal with the matter. Two friends of Lola, who also work at the bar, reveal to Murat that when Osman discovered that Lola was gay, Osman raped her. When Lola stood up to him, Osman threw her out of the house. The friends warn Murat that Billy is the same type of person that Osman is. Murat dresses as Lola, using Lola's red wig to feign his identity.

Sandra finds herself at odds with Leah , a sassy and rude neighbour who has been expelled from school, does several drugs, and constantly listens and sings along to her mother's Cass Elliot records. While Jamie's homosexuality remains concealed, his introvert nature and dislike of football are reason enough for his classmates to bully him at every opportunity. Ste , who is living together with his drug-dealing brother and abusive, alcoholic father in the flat next door, is one night beaten by his brother so badly that Sandra takes pity and lets him sleep over. In the absence of a third bed, Ste has to make do with sleeping 'top-to-toe' with Jamie. On the second night they share a bed: after a massage and a minor conversation, the boys soon change sleeping arrangements and Jamie kisses Ste for the first time. The next morning, Ste panics and leaves before Jamie awakens, avoiding him for days. Jamie works up the nerve to steal a Gay Times from a newsagent, apparently starting to accept his sexuality and affection for Ste. Jamie finally spots Ste at a nearby party and confronts him; they prepare to leave together. The party ends badly, with Sandra taking vengeance on Leah for gossiping, who then threatens to 'spill the beans' about Ste and Jamie and confesses to having covered up for Ste in front of his father and brother. Ste reacts poorly, angrily rejecting Jamie and running away. Slowly, Ste accepts Jamie's love and their relationship begins to develop as they visit a gay pub together. Sandra follows them and discovers their secret, and the film reaches its climax as a bad trip by Leah  precipitates Sandra's breakup with Tony; the news of Sandra's new job comes out; and Sandra confronts Ste and Jamie. Sandra comes to accept her son's relationship. The film ends with the two boys slow-dancing in the courtyard of their council flats to the Cass Elliot song ""Dream a Little Dream of Me"", while a guarding Sandra dances defiantly at their side with Leah as the local residents look on; some of them shocked, some of them enjoying the moment themselves."

34083162	/m/0hrfkt1	Badha	2005		170	"{""/m/01c7y"": ""Bengali Language""}"	{}	{}	Illya Kuryakin is investigating the theft of cats in the Soho area of London, and Napolean Solo is on a mission to determine the whereabouts of the famous, suddenly youthful appearing, and now missing 83 year old biologist Benjamin Lancer. Solo contacts Lancer’s daughter Lorelei, a model at the Paris salon of Madame Raine De Sala. De Sala orders her associate Olga and another model Do Do to make sure that Lorelei does not speak to Solo. De Sala herself visits Sir Norman Swickert, a very old statesman she knew and admired as a child, and brings along with her Dr. Gritsky – a colleague of Dr. Lancer. Swickert complains of being too old to have political power anymore, and De Sala reveals her desire for such power as he once had, her resentment of not having it available to her since she is a woman, and her ability to make him a younger man with Gritsky’s help. Meanwhile, Solo’s efforts to contact Lorelei result in Do Do and Olga acting together to kill her rather than have her speak to Solo. Solo discovers this when he is lured to Lorelei’s apartment and, after a fight with Do Do, discovers both Lorelei’s body and a note to Lorelei that she could contact her father through Philip Bainbridge. Solo attempts to contact Bainbridge in London , but Swickert is speaking with him first. Swickert becomes convinced that the middle-aged Bainbridge is actually the elderly Lancer made young again via a medical process. Olga has followed Solo and, in attempting to kill him, accidentally kills Bainbridge/Lancer. A chase and fight ensues with the result being the escape of Olga and the death of Do Do. Having seen Swickert with Lancer, Solo visits Swickert at his country estate and questions him about Bainbridge and Lancer. Swickert refuses to say much beyond that Lancer was a member of the Bridge of Lions club, a private chess club that Swickert founded to build a bridge among the great men of many nations to allow them freedom to communicate under all circumstances – thereby reducing the chances of cataclysms like World War I. Shortly after leaving Swickert’s home, Solo’s car crashes as a result of sabotage – implied to be the work of Olga. Solo is found by THRUSH agent Jordin, who advises U.N.C.L.E. of Solo’s predicament and location.  Kuryakin, still investigating the missing cats, tracks one of them to a laboratory. He find the cat de-aged to a kitten and the man said to have been capturing the cats, Corvy, dead by a hat pin. Solo  arrives as well and, after comparing notes the two men reach the conclusion that the cats, having a similar nervous system to humans, are being experimented upon with the de-aging process developed by Lancer and Gritsky. Kuryakin finds that hat associated with the pin and it turns out to be from Madame Raine De Sala’s salon. From this point on they collaborate on their assignments. Solo and Kuryakin next break into Swickert’s home and are captured by Swickert’s guard and Olga. Tossed into a wine press with the press descending, they are left for dead. They nonetheless figure out how to brace the press and are eventually released by Jordin after everyone else leaves the estate. After a brief interrogation by Jordin, the U.N.C.L.E. agents overpower him and, while he escapes, are again free. In very short order Swickert is de-aged and regains his stature as a man of power. Solo and Kuryakin confront him and demand the secret of rejuvenation. Jordin, listening covertly to their conversation, captures Gritsky and blackmails De Sala: he will only provide continued curative treatments to Swickert if De Sala uses her influence to make Swickert do THRUSH’s bidding in political matters. Solo finds out and is captured again. Because of his past association with Swickert, Waverly travels to England to speak to him, but is also captured by Jordin and placed with Solo. Swickert, having taken another treatment with Gritsky and learning of THRUSH’s plans for him, decides that Gritsky and his secret must die to keep anyone else from suffering his fate. Jordin saves Gritsky, but Swickert goes on to give a political speech wherein he explains enough of THRUSH’s plans that Jordin draws a gun. De Sala jumps in front on Swickert to protect him and ends up shot and killed in his stead. Solo, having escaped with Waverly via an incidiary rope in Waverly’s tie, meets up with Kuryakin and investigate Gritsky’s laboratory. They find Gritsky has taken Swickert’s worries to heart and committed suicide by de-aging rapidly to a child. Jordin comes in, takes Gritsky’s notes, and destroys the de-aging machine so no one else can have it. But Gritsky booby-trapped the machine and Jordin is killed. Solo and Kuryakin return to New York, and since the secret of the de-aging process is written in code, it appears to be lost to science for a very long time.

After triumphing, he morphs into modern day Ned Thacker . Ned is born and raised in Kansas by a mother who passes along to him her love of D'Artagnan and The Three Musketeers, despite his father's concern that it is not good for him. In fact, Ned does get into trouble with his  chivalrous attempts to help women. Finally, Ned can stand it no more; he decides to leave dull Kansas. In mirroring scenes, D'Artagnan is astride a somewhat less-than-noble steed, a present from his father for his departure from home, while Ned's father gives him the modern equivalent: a car. While driving in the desert, he comes upon a chauffeur-driven automobile stopped because the road ahead has been washed away. Unimpressed with one passenger, the middle-aged Forrest Vandeteer , Ned is quite taken with the lovely ""Park Avenue flapper"" Elsie Dodge. Her mother, the third passenger, sees her only daughter's marriage to Vandeteer as the solution to their dire financial straits. Vandeteer buys what he wants, and he wants Elsie. She, however, loathes her suitor; she much prefers young Ned. Ned comes up with the idea to put his car on railroad tracks. He takes the party  to their Grand Canyon resort hotel. There, Ned questions John Blabb, who works for ""Town Topics"". Blabb informs him that Vandeteer already has three wives hidden away somewhere. Meanwhile, Chin-de-dah, the Native American leader of an outlaw gang hiding in a tributary canyon, is bored. He decides to kidnap a white woman to be his wife . He goes to the resort, pretending to be a guide, and selects Elsie as his target. Ned is suspicious, but Vandeteer hires him. Vandeteer and Elsie set out for a horse ride down the canyon with their guide. Ned uses the time to persuade Mrs. Dodge that her daughter's happiness should take priority over their financial security. James Brown, a member of the gang who knows and hates Vandeteer, gleefully tells Ned about the man's impending demise and Chin-de-dah's intentions toward Elsie. Ned shames him into helping with a rescue. They reach the camp in time to free Elsie and Vandeteer, but remain in peril. Vandeteer offers Ned $100,000 to save his life; Ned makes him put it in writing. Then they are lifted up the sheer cliff by a rope pulled by a horse. Once they are safe, Brown wants to kill Vandeteer, who falsely incriminated him in Vandeteer's own scam and stole his wife and children.

Seung-min and Seo-yeon  had lived in the same neighborhood and attended the same architecture class.

Hoping to confess his feelings to her at the perfect timing, Seung-min asks Seo-yeon to meet him at the abandoned house they frequent, on the first day that it snows that coming winter. But one night he catches Jae-wook and a drunk Seo-yeon entering her house together. Fearing the worst, he ends his friendship with Seo-yeon due to his pain of believing she had chosen Jae-wook.

Middle-aged police detective Jo Sang-gil , a single father with a young son and daughter, is assigned the seemingly straightforward case of a man, Oh Gyeong-il, who set fire to himself inside a car. Chafing at his lack of promotion after so long on the police force, but under pressure from his boss-cum-friend , he also grudgingly agrees to work with rookie detective Cha Eun-young , a 30-year-old divorcee who has just been transferred from motorcycle patrol duty. The dead man, who had drugs in his system, has a large dog-bite on his thigh but no fingerprints. The police discover the immolation was not suicide but was triggered by a timer in the victim's trouser belt. Sang-gil traces the sex club the victim had visited but bawls out Eun-young when she makes an amateurish error during a fight. Against protocol, Sang-gil omits to file reports on the progress of the case, as he wants to earn all the kudos himself and thereby a promotion. His boss finds out, just as a second victim, Nam Sang-hun, is found bitten to death by a large dog or wolf. After talking to dog-trainers, the police learn the man they need to see is Min Tae-shik, a retired police dog trainer who lives with his drug addict daughter; during a raid on his house, Min escapes and a wolf-dog subsequently kills a woman in the backstreets. Eun-young starts questioning police-dog trainers, as well as investigating those missing or dead, and comes up with the name of Kang Myung-ho, who supposedly committed suicide a while ago. She sets off to investigate on her own.{{cite web}}{{cite web}}{{cite web}}

She replied that she did' He asked he if she lost anything while she was out and shows her the gun. With a glassy stare she tells him, ""I never travel with firearms"". At the dinner party, the topic of crimes of passion comes up and Francoise defends a woman's right to commit a crime of passion because the parties who have wronged her have killed her first. After the dinner, he confronts her and calls her a fiend. She tells him that she intends not to say anything and at first he threatens to turn her in to the police. Instead he tells Francoise that he will stay and keep her secret to watch her fall apart. He moves out of the bedroom. Two months pass and Paul notes in his diary that Francoise still has not turned herself in but instead exhibits a cool unemotional exterior. At dinner she tells Paul that she intend to leave him and travel. Odette's dog is brought to Paul while they are at dinner and Paul decides to keep him since he has no home. The dog's presence makes Francoise uneasy. Francoise reads Paul's diary and in the last entry he says that even if she travels her feelings of guilt will follow her. The last line says that he is unable to feel sorry for her. Francoise puts a line though that last line and underneath writes, ""I am staying"". Francoise unexpectedly shows up at a party Paul is throwing for the 100th performance of his play, the party is being held on the stage. He had just finished telling everyone that she wasn't coming because she was feeling unwell. The rest if the crowd seems pleased to see her but when she sits and the table offers a toast to her, Paul remains silent. As she sits at the table, A young actor who is drunk, flirts with her and forces her out into the dance floor for a dance. Francoise keeps seeing the shooting over and over again and leaves the room. Paul notes in his diary that Francoise is rapidly becoming weighed down by her guilt. By now she is looking very ill and tired but refuses to allow Paul to call a doctor for her. He receives a letter that at first he refuses to read to her. When she demands he read it, she finds out that the bank robber has been convicted of Odette's murder and sentenced to death. Francoise goes to her friend, the district attorney and asks for permission to see the Castelli , condemned man. He is hostile to her when she is let into his cell. She confesses to him that she murdered Odette. He tells her that she should go away and to never mention it again, he would have been executed for killing the bank teller anyway. He sees it as a joke, the authorities are going to execute him for a crime he truly did not commit. It is six month later and Paul tells Francoise that she is the only person suffering more than him but as long as she won't confess, she will continue to die inside. At dinner that night, she sees a paper where Castelli confessed to killing Odette just before being hanged. While she is unconscious her mind plays though all of the events of the past six months. When she wakes up, Paul tells her that she is the only person who can help herself. After a moment's pause, she picks up the phone and makes an appointment to see the attorney general to turn herself in for the murder. Paul says that he will stand by her throughout her upcoming ordeal. She declines his offer but asks that he comes to visit her in jail occasionally. He helps her dress and once more she tells him to remain as she leaves to make her way to confess to the murder. As she walks, along, Paul is walking a distance behind her. A boy runs into the street after a ball. He falls as a truck is bearing down on him. Francoise jumps into the street to save him and sustains a critical head injury. The doctor gives Paul the good news that while Francoise will live, she has lost her memory of her entire life and how to do basic functions such as feeding herself, their names and her entire life history. This includes her murder and subsequent guilt. The final scene shows that Paul has taken Francoise to the south of France to recuperate, She is repeating simple words such as ""sand"" and ""mountain"" and he is taking care of her, convinced that this is God's plan."

11385169Tom sneaks into the kitchen to the fridge. He grabs a whole chicken and takes a couple of bites out of it before he hears George coming his way. Tom hurriedly shoves the chicken back into the refrigerator and hides. George, upon discovering the half-eaten chicken, concludes that either Tom or Spike is guilty and is determined to figure out which, even if it means X-raying them. Panicked, Tom frames Spike; he creates phony ink footprints leading from the sleeping dog to the refrigerator. As Tom moves to plant the chicken on Spike, a bright light flashes, and Jerry, holding a camera, runs off. Joan and George see the ""evidence"" implicating Spike and kick him out of the house. Spike laments being framed as he watches George and Joan allow Tom to gobble down the remainder of the chicken. Meanwhile, Jerry emerges from his darkroom, having made numerous copies of his photo of Tom framing Spike. Jerry plants copies of the photos in places where George or Joan are likely to see them. Tom is forced to use the guise of being a recklessly playful cat as he swoops in to destroy the photos before George and/or Joan see them. To make matters worse, Tom taunts Spike from inside, leading George to think that the cat has gone crazy. Jerry begins folding the photos into paper airplanes and tosses them towards Joan in the kitchen and George in the den. Tom swallows the airplane meant for Joan and begins frantically chasing the airplane headed towards George with a pair of scissors. Tom's efforts to stop the plane only serve to cut up George's newspaper and his trousers. George intercepts Tom right before the cat nearly cuts his head off. With Tom's tail in one hand, George catches the paper plane with his other hand and, as Tom prays for mercy, unfold it, discovering Tom's deception. As George kicks Tom out of the house, Jerry has his camera out again and photographs the moment. Joan and George let Spike back into the house and ask for forgiveness, which the dog gladly grants. Jerry then calls Spike over and gives him a present that he laughs heartily over; a photo of Tom getting kicked out of the house.

6542034The film begins after the 1997 British general election, where Tony Blair  becomes Britain's Labour prime minister. The Queen  is slightly wary of Blair and his pledge to ""modernise"" the country, but Blair promises to respect the Royal Family. Three months later, Diana, Princess of Wales dies in a car crash in the Alma Bridge tunnel in Paris along with her companion Dodi Fayed and driver Henri Paul. Blair's director of communications, Alastair Campbell , prepares a speech in which Diana is described as ""the people's princess"". Blair gives his speech the next day and the phrase catches on. Over the next few days, millions of people across London display an outpouring of grief at Buckingham and Kensington Palaces. Meanwhile, the Royal Family are still at Balmoral Castle, their summer estate in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. Diana's death sparks division among numerous members of the family. The Royal Family observes that, since Diana was divorced from her husband, Prince Charles  a year earlier, she is no longer a part of the family. They insist that Diana's funeral is a ""private affair"" and is best left to Diana's noble family, the Spencers. Charles argues that the mother of a future king cannot be dismissed so lightly, and the Queen allows the use of an aircraft of the British Royal Flight to bring Diana's body back to England. In London, flowers pile up along the palace railings, forcing the changing of the Queen's guard to use another gate. British tabloids become inflammatory about the lack of a statement from the Royal Family. Charles leaves no doubt that he shares Blair's views about the need for a statement. As the Royal Family's ratings plummet, Blair's popularity rises, to the delight of his anti-monarchist advisers and wife Cherie . However, Blair does not share these sentiments. While disagreeing with the Queen's course of action, Blair begins to develop an admiration for her. Blair disagrees with his wife's views and tells her that a republican Britain is ludicrous, and begins to denounce the anti-royal disdain of his Labour Party advisors. Blair calls the Queen at Balmoral and recommends strong measures to regain public confidence for the monarchy: attend a public funeral for Diana at Westminster Abbey, fly a Union flag at half mast over Buckingham Palace, and speak to the nation about Diana's life and legacy in a televised address. Blair's recommendations outrage several other members of the Royal Family including Prince Philip  and the Queen Mother . Philip is surprised that Elton John is asked to attend and sing a song, ""Candle in the Wind"" in Diana's memory. They view such steps as an undignified surrender to public hysteria. The Queen seems concerned about this and although she shares their feelings, she has doubts as she closely follows the news. The Queen believes that there has been a shift in public values and that perhaps she should abdicate. The Queen Mother dismisses the idea, saying that she is one of the greatest assets her monarchy has ever had, stating: ""The real problem will come when you leave"". She also reminds the Queen of the promise she made in Cape Town, South Africa on her 21st birthday, in which she promised that her ""whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong..."" Meanwhile, Philip attempts to distract William and Harry  from Diana's death by taking them deer stalking. While venturing out alone in her Land Rover, the Queen damages the vehicle while crossing a river and is forced to telephone for assistance. The Queen weeps in frustration, but catches sight of a majestic Red Deer which Philip, William, and Harry have been stalking. She is struck by his beauty and the two stare at each other. Hearing a distant gunshot, she shoos the animal away. The Queen decides to carry out Blair's recommendations. While preparing to return to London to attend Diana's public funeral, the Queen is horrified to learn that the deer has been killed on a neighbouring estate. She asks to see the stag and is upset at its loss. The Royal Family finally return to London to inspect the floral tributes, and while watching live television coverage along with his staff, Blair becomes angry and disappointed at his Labour Party advisors, for which he states that the Queen is admirable, and thinks that Diana had thrown everything she offered back in her face and seemed to destroy everything held most dear by the Queen. The Queen later follows Blair's advice and gives her public statement, speaking about Diana's life and legacy on live television and describing Diana as ""an exceptional and gifted human being"". Two months after Diana's death, Blair visits Buckingham Palace for a weekly meeting. The Queen finally regained her popularity, but she believes that Blair has benefited himself from her acquiescence to his advice and that she will never fully recover from ""that week"". The Queen cautions Blair that one day, he will find that public opinion can rapidly turn against him and declares that times have changed and that the monarchy must ""modernise"".

1039551{{plot}} Darryl Walker  is a clumsy nerdy repairman, who is a genius. Darrel had a pure heart and an optimstic Pollyannish personality. He is childishly naive to the realities of living in an inner city neighborhood. The area suffers from political corruption and the police are on strike. It takes the murder of his grandmother, an avid supporter of Alderman Marvin Harris' anti corruption campaign for Mayor, by members of mobster Michael Minelli to awaken him to the realities of his city's urban decay. He expresses his frustrations by intervening in a situation and boldly saving an elderly transit passenger from being mugged, and by ranting about the general corruptible state that the city has become. Darryl was so pure and shielded from reality presumably because of his interest in inventing, that he does not even realize that there is a ""crackhouse in front of our flat"". He tries to storm into it unarmed and rebuke the gang members, oblivious to the hazardous stupidity of doing so. Awareness to the city's issues inspires Darryl to become Blankman. He uses his technical expertise to create weapons and gadgets. His brother Kevin, a tabloid news cameraman, goes along with this fantasy believing that it's Darryl's way to cope with the murder of his grandmother. He demands an audience with the police commissioner, but the police are not impressed with his actions, ridicule him, and arrest him for disturbing the peace. Darryl is released on orders to see a shrink. The shrink calls Darryl normal, but a geek, infuriating Kevin, who the shrink then attempts to psychoanalyze. After Darryl is nearly killed trying to protect a citizen on the street, Kevin tries to get him to tone his activities down, advising him to start a neighborhood watch. After he delivers a woman's baby in an elevator, he is asked for his name. Darryl just stares, and Kevin replies, ""He's gone blank, ma'am."" Both the lady and the reporters interpret this as a name: Blankman. Over time he protects various other people in the community, building up a reputation and inspiring both the town and other real life superheroes. Kevin, hoping to win the affections of Kimberly Jonz, a reporter at his TV station, begs Darryl to allow her to interview him. He relents, on the condition that she wear a carnation. He brings her to his secret hideout, an abandoned subway station, and they talk about how he took up his duties to memorialize his grandmother and prevent crime. Impressed by his heroics and modesty, Kimberly immediately falls in love with Darryl and she kisses him causing him to have an erection. Mayor Harris, who refused Minelli's attempts at bribery, attempts to bring in outside money to pay the IOUs the city has been giving its workers. He also asks that Blankman be there to protect the people and receive a special award. As the money is released, Minelli's henchmen storm the bank and take the mayor hostage, threatening to detonate explosives. At the police chief's request and the crowd's chants, Blankman attempts to save the mayor, but is unable to disarm all the bombs. He reveals his identity to the mayor and tells him of his grandmother's support for the mayor. Mayor Harris wishes him well, warning him to run and says he will tell Mrs. Walker about Darryl. Blankman runs out screaming as the bank explodes. The crowd, seeing his failure, turn on him, chasing him down the street. Darryl then gives up his heroic works for a normal life, getting a job at a McDonald's. Wanting a great story Kevin's boss Jason Stone, a tabloid news junkie, manages to contact Minelli and trades knowledge of Blankman's love for Kimberly in exchange for an exclusive interview. In the midst of doing research on Minelli and Darryl's grandmother's death, Kimberly calls Kevin with the news. As Kevin answers, Minelli takes Kimberly hostage. Minelli issues a verbal threat to Kevin , telling him he will kill Kimberly if Blankman does not show up. Kevin rushes to Darryl's workplace with the news, but Darryl refuses to help wanting a normal life. Kevin finally convinces him with the news that Minelli had their grandmother killed and that he will wear the costume Darryl designed for him. The two rush to Darryl's underground lair where he again turns into Blankman. Kevin becomes his new sidekick but without a name. He just goes by ""Other Guy"". The two heroes then rush to the TV station. After shooting the reporter interviewing him, Minelli becomes fed up. While threatening Stone, Blankman and Other Guy crash through the window and attempt a rescue. The two engage in a fight with Minelli's goons, losing. They are placed in a water tank and left to slowly drown. Stone and Kimberly are chained to desks and left to die as Minelli has hidden bombs in the building. At this point, Blankman calls in J-5, his robot assistant, to save them. J-5 drills a hole in the tank and the pair kick their way to freedom at the last minute. The duo then search for the bombs, finding them in a women's bathroom. Activating J-5's ""bomb disposal mode,"" Blankman stuffs the explosives inside and frees Kimberly. Stone is left behind, a joke Other Guy wants to play on his boss. Once outside, the explosives detonate, destroying J-5. Distraught, Blankman swears revenge. Tracking Minelli to his hideout in a factory, the two prepare for the final battle. Other Guy, however, is overconfident and is wounded because his costume is not bulletproof like Darryl's. Blankman then defeats Minelli's goons with his electric ""newchucks"" . Just when Minelli is about to kill Other Guy, Blankman activates his jet-powered roller blades and captures Minelli and delivers him to the police. Blankman is once again acknowledged as a hero  by the people, receiving the Mayor Harris Award for outstanding community service at a ceremony in their honor. Other Guy receives a Blankman t-shirt . After the ceremony, Kevin introduces Kimberly to ""Darryl."" The two make light conversation until Kimberly pretends to see a purse snatcher, putting Darryl on alert. Kimberly then reveals she knows that they are Blankman and Other Guy, and she kisses Darryl to prove it. Darryl falls to the ground after getting the same embarrassing reaction he had the first time while Kevin and Kimberly laugh at him. The film ends with a shot of a banner that reads ""We Love You Blankman...and the Other Guy"".
286544On May 10, 1998, teenage amateur astronomer Leo Biederman  discovers an unusual object near the stars Mizar and Alcor at a star party in Richmond, Virginia. He alerts astronomer Marcus Wolf , who realizes that the object is a comet on a collision course with Earth, but dies in a car accident before he can alert the world. A year later, MSNBC reporter Jenny Lerner  investigates the resignation of the Secretary of the Treasury  and his connection to an ""Ellie"". She discovers that Ellie is not a mistress but an acronym: ""E.L.E."", for ""Extinction-Level Event"". Because of Lerner's investigation, President Tom Beck  advances the announcement of the grim facts: The comet, named Wolf-Biederman, is {{convert}} wide, large enough to destroy all life if it strikes Earth. The United States and Russia have been secretly constructing a spacecraft, the Messiah, in orbit. They plan to use it to transport a team lead by Captain Spurgeon Tanner  to the comet, so that it can be destroyed with nuclear weapons. After landing on the comet, the crew members plant nuclear bombs 100 meters beneath the surface. When the bombs are detonated, the ship is damaged and loses contact with Earth. Instead of being destroyed, the comet splits into two smaller rocks nicknamed ""Biederman""  and ""Wolf"" , both world-threatening. Beck announces the Messiah crew’s failure, declares martial law, and reveals that governments worldwide have been building underground shelters. The United States' shelter is in the limestone caves of Missouri. The US government conducts a lottery to select 800,000 ordinary Americans aged 50 and under to join 200,000 pre-selected scientists, engineers, teachers, artists, soldiers, and officials. Lerner and Leo's families are pre-selected, but Leo's girlfriend Sarah Hotchner  is not. Leo marries Sarah to save her family but the Hotchners are mistakenly left off the evacuee list; Sarah refuses to leave without them. A last-ditch effort to use Earth's missile-borne nuclear weapons to deflect the two chunks of the comet fails. Leo returns home looking for Sarah, but her family has left for the Appalachian Mountains and is trapped in a traffic jam on the highway. Sarah's parents urge Leo to take Sarah and her baby brother to high ground; Sarah still does not want to abandon her parents, but they convince her to let them go. Lerner gives up her seat in the last evacuation helicopter to her friend Beth, who has a young daughter. She instead joins her estranged father  at her childhood beach house, where they reconcile and remember happier times. The Biederman fragment impacts in the Atlantic Ocean near Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, creating a megatsunami. Leo, Sarah and her baby brother survive. Lerner, her father, Sarah's parents, and millions along the Atlantic coasts of North and South America, Europe, and Africa perish. The world braces for the impact of Wolf in western Canada, which will create a cloud of dust that will block out the sun for two years. This, in turn, will destroy all remaining life on the surface. Low on fuel and life support, the crew of the Messiah decides to undertake a suicide mission with the remaining nuclear warheads. After saying goodbye to their loved ones by video conference, the ship reaches the fragment and enters a fissure to blow itself up, which breaks Wolf into much smaller pieces, which burn up in Earth's atmosphere. President Beck, speaking to a large crowd in front of the United States Capitol building, which is undergoing reconstruction, urges the nation and the world to continue their recovery.

On his way home from school, Stuart saves a female canary named Margalo who is being pursued by a peregrine falcon, and they become friends. But she is secretly working with Falcon to case and steal from households. When he presses her to find and take an object of value, or lose the sanctuary he promised her, she can't seem to concentrate on her assignment, as she is beginning to fall in love with Stuart. Falcon eventually loses patience and threatens to kill him if she doesn't deliver. Worried for his safety, she takes Eleanor Little's diamond ring. When the Littles see that the ring is missing, they think it has fallen down the sink. Stuart offers to be lowered down the drain on a string to get it, and nearly succeeds. When it breaks Margalo saves him, and his thanks to her only makes her feel even more guilty, so she decides to leave. When he can't find her, he assumes she has been kidnapped - and that Falcon is somehow involved. He leaves on a quest to rescue her with the household's reluctant cat Snowbell, but not before setting up a plan with George. Stuart and Snowbell enlist the help of Monty, who tells them that Falcon's lair is at the disused observation deck of the nearby Pishkin Building. They use balloons to get Stuart to the top, where he finds out that Margalo is Falcon's slave, and was forced to take the ring. He tries to save her, but Falcon captures him, and drops him in a garbage truck. Unaware of this, Margalo tells Snowbell that Falcon killed Stuart. On a garbage scow where he has ended up, Stuart blames himself for everything, and has almost lost all hope. Suddenly, he finds George's broken plane, fixes it up, and flies to save Margalo, who, having been freed by Snowbell, just fled from Falcon. The Littles, who have discovered his absence and whereabouts follow him by taxi as he begins an aerial adventure through the park, with Margalo at his side. They lose Falcon, but he catches up and makes an attempt to kill Stuart, when he detaches the plane's upper wing, damaging the main one and causing it to enter a steep nose dive, which fails when Stuart recovers from the dive, nearly missing the Littles. Unable to run from Falcon, he lets Margalo off. He turns and flies the damaged plane in a kamikaze run while Falcon goes into an attack dive. He uses Mrs. Little's ring to temporarily blind him, and jumps out using a bandana as a parachute. The kamikaze attack works and Falcon is struck head on and defeated. Although he survives the attack, he falls out of the sky and lands in a garbage can that Monty is scavenging in, and is presumably eaten by him, but not before Stuart falls when his parachute is sliced apart by the propeller of the shattered plane, and then is rescued by Margalo. Stuart is congratulated by his family, and Margalo, who gives Mrs. Little her ring back, and Snowbell reunites with them as well. That evening, Margalo leaves with the other birds to migrate south, but not before saying goodbye to her friends. Stuart says the ""silver lining"" is that she'll be back in the spring, and his baby sister, Martha, says her first words: ""Bye bye, birdie."", as the family head inside to the comfort of their home.

One firm gives her an expensive sixteen-cylinder car, and hotel owner Mr. Louis Louis  installs her in a luxury suite, hoping that this will deter Ball from foreclosing on his failing establishment. When Mary goes to an automat for a meal, she meets John Ball Jr. , J.B.'s son. He is determined to make it on his own and is working anonymously at the restaurant. However, he is fired for giving Mary free food. When Mary finds out he has no place to stay, she invites him to share her enormous suite while he looks for a new job. They quickly fall in love. Meanwhile, as time goes on, her supposed connection to J.B has satirically disastrous consequences for the stock market. Stockbroker E.F. Hulgar  asks her for inside information about steel from Mr. Ball. The only Ball the confused Mary knows is John Jr., so she consults him. He jokingly tells her it is going down and she passes it along to Hulgar. As a result, everybody begins selling, just as J.B. starts buying, causing J.B.'s company to teeter on the brink of bankruptcy. When Mary, John, and J.B. finally get together and figure out what is going on, John comes up with a bright solution - getting Mary to tell Hulgar that J.B. has cornered the market. Prices shoot up, rescuing the beleaguered financier. The delighted father gives his son a job. John then offers Mary a job too: fixing his breakfast every day as his wife.

Delilah and Peola quickly become like family to Jessie and Bea. They particularly enjoy Delilah's pancakes, made from a special family recipe. Five years later, Jessie and Peola prove to be challenging children to raise: Jessie is demanding, not particularly studious, relying instead on her charm, and is the first person to call Peola ""black"" in a hurtful way, making it clear that their childhood idyll is doomed. Peola does not tell her classmates at school that she is ""colored"" and is humiliated when her mother shows up one day, revealing her secret. Bea finds it difficult to make a living selling pancake syrup . Using her wiles to get a store on the busy Atlantic City boardwalk refurbished for practically nothing, she opens a pancake restaurant on the boardwalk . Later, at the suggestion of a passerby, Elmer Smith , she sets up an even more successful pancake flour corporation, marketing Delilah as an Aunt Jemima-like figure. She gives Delilah a 20% interest in the business but Delilah continues to act as Bea's housekeeper. As a result, Bea becomes a wealthy business woman, but all is not well as the story advances ten years.  Eighteen-year-old Jessie , home on college vacation, falls in love with her mother's boyfriend, Stephen Archer , who is unaware at first of her affections. Meanwhile, Peola , ashamed of her African-American heritage, attempts to pass as white, breaking Delilah's heart. Peola runs away from her Negro college and takes a job as a cashier in a white store. When her mother and Bea track her down, she is again humiliated to be identified as black and ultimately tells her mother that she is going away, never to return, so she can pass as a white woman without the fear that Delilah will show up. Delilah is literally heartbroken and, in a melodramatic scene, takes to her bed and dies, murmuring Peola's name and forgiving her. The black servants are glimpsed singing a spiritual as she passes, Bea holding her hand at the end. Delilah's last wish had been for a large, grand funeral, complete with a marching band and a horse-drawn hearse. Just before the processional begins, a remorseful, crying Peola appears, begging her mother to forgive her. Peola returns to her Negro college and presumably abandons her efforts to pass as white. The film ends with Bea breaking her engagement with Stephen because of the situation with Jessie and doesn't want to hurt her feelings while being with him; although Bea promises to come find him once Jessie has forgotten him. The movie ends with Bea embracing Jessie while remembering Jessie's insistent demands for her toy duck  back when she was a toddler.

6542034The film begins after the 1997 British general election, where Tony Blair  becomes Britain's Labour prime minister. The Queen  is slightly wary of Blair and his pledge to ""modernise"" the country, but Blair promises to respect the Royal Family. Three months later, Diana, Princess of Wales dies in a car crash in the Alma Bridge tunnel in Paris along with her companion Dodi Fayed and driver Henri Paul. Blair's director of communications, Alastair Campbell , prepares a speech in which Diana is described as ""the people's princess"". Blair gives his speech the next day and the phrase catches on. Over the next few days, millions of people across London display an outpouring of grief at Buckingham and Kensington Palaces. Meanwhile, the Royal Family are still at Balmoral Castle, their summer estate in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. Diana's death sparks division among numerous members of the family. The Royal Family observes that, since Diana was divorced from her husband, Prince Charles  a year earlier, she is no longer a part of the family. They insist that Diana's funeral is a ""private affair"" and is best left to Diana's noble family, the Spencers. Charles argues that the mother of a future king cannot be dismissed so lightly, and the Queen allows the use of an aircraft of the British Royal Flight to bring Diana's body back to England. In London, flowers pile up along the palace railings, forcing the changing of the Queen's guard to use another gate. British tabloids become inflammatory about the lack of a statement from the Royal Family. Charles leaves no doubt that he shares Blair's views about the need for a statement. As the Royal Family's ratings plummet, Blair's popularity rises, to the delight of his anti-monarchist advisers and wife Cherie . However, Blair does not share these sentiments. While disagreeing with the Queen's course of action, Blair begins to develop an admiration for her. Blair disagrees with his wife's views and tells her that a republican Britain is ludicrous, and begins to denounce the anti-royal disdain of his Labour Party advisors. Blair calls the Queen at Balmoral and recommends strong measures to regain public confidence for the monarchy: attend a public funeral for Diana at Westminster Abbey, fly a Union flag at half mast over Buckingham Palace, and speak to the nation about Diana's life and legacy in a televised address. Blair's recommendations outrage several other members of the Royal Family including Prince Philip  and the Queen Mother . Philip is surprised that Elton John is asked to attend and sing a song, ""Candle in the Wind"" in Diana's memory. They view such steps as an undignified surrender to public hysteria. The Queen seems concerned about this and although she shares their feelings, she has doubts as she closely follows the news. The Queen believes that there has been a shift in public values and that perhaps she should abdicate. The Queen Mother dismisses the idea, saying that she is one of the greatest assets her monarchy has ever had, stating: ""The real problem will come when you leave"". She also reminds the Queen of the promise she made in Cape Town, South Africa on her 21st birthday, in which she promised that her ""whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong..."" Meanwhile, Philip attempts to distract William and Harry  from Diana's death by taking them deer stalking. While venturing out alone in her Land Rover, the Queen damages the vehicle while crossing a river and is forced to telephone for assistance. The Queen weeps in frustration, but catches sight of a majestic Red Deer which Philip, William, and Harry have been stalking. She is struck by his beauty and the two stare at each other. Hearing a distant gunshot, she shoos the animal away. The Queen decides to carry out Blair's recommendations. While preparing to return to London to attend Diana's public funeral, the Queen is horrified to learn that the deer has been killed on a neighbouring estate. She asks to see the stag and is upset at its loss. The Royal Family finally return to London to inspect the floral tributes, and while watching live television coverage along with his staff, Blair becomes angry and disappointed at his Labour Party advisors, for which he states that the Queen is admirable, and thinks that Diana had thrown everything she offered back in her face and seemed to destroy everything held most dear by the Queen. The Queen later follows Blair's advice and gives her public statement, speaking about Diana's life and legacy on live television and describing Diana as ""an exceptional and gifted human being"". Two months after Diana's death, Blair visits Buckingham Palace for a weekly meeting. The Queen finally regained her popularity, but she believes that Blair has benefited himself from her acquiescence to his advice and that she will never fully recover from ""that week"". The Queen cautions Blair that one day, he will find that public opinion can rapidly turn against him and declares that times have changed and that the monarchy must ""modernise"". When Blair suggests that he can help with this, the Queen replies: ""Don't get ahead of yourself, Prime Minister. Remember, I'm supposed to be the one advising you"".

1039551{{plot}} Darryl Walker  is a clumsy nerdy repairman, who is a genius. Darrel had a pure heart and an optimstic Pollyannish personality. He is childishly naive to the realities of living in an inner city neighborhood. The area suffers from political corruption and the police are on strike. It takes the murder of his grandmother, an avid supporter of Alderman Marvin Harris' anti corruption campaign for Mayor, by members of mobster Michael Minelli to awaken him to the realities of his city's urban decay. He expresses his frustrations by intervening in a situation and boldly saving an elderly transit passenger from being mugged, and by ranting about the general corruptible state that the city has become. Darryl was so pure and shielded from reality presumably because of his interest in inventing, that he does not even realize that there is a ""crackhouse in front of our flat"". He tries to storm into it unarmed and rebuke the gang members, oblivious to the hazardous stupidity of doing so. Awareness to the city's issues inspires Darryl to become Blankman. He uses his technical expertise to create weapons and gadgets. His brother Kevin, a tabloid news cameraman, goes along with this fantasy believing that it's Darryl's way to cope with the murder of his grandmother. He demands an audience with the police commissioner, but the police are not impressed with his actions, ridicule him, and arrest him for disturbing the peace. Darryl is released on orders to see a shrink. The shrink calls Darryl normal, but a geek, infuriating Kevin, who the shrink then attempts to psychoanalyze. After Darryl is nearly killed trying to protect a citizen on the street, Kevin tries to get him to tone his activities down, advising him to start a neighborhood watch. After he delivers a woman's baby in an elevator, he is asked for his name. Darryl just stares, and Kevin replies, ""He's gone blank, ma'am."" Both the lady and the reporters interpret this as a name: Blankman. Over time he protects various other people in the community, building up a reputation and inspiring both the town and other real life superheroes. Kevin, hoping to win the affections of Kimberly Jonz, a reporter at his TV station, begs Darryl to allow her to interview him. He relents, on the condition that she wear a carnation. He brings her to his secret hideout, an abandoned subway station, and they talk about how he took up his duties to memorialize his grandmother and prevent crime. Impressed by his heroics and modesty, Kimberly immediately falls in love with Darryl and she kisses him causing him to have an erection. Mayor Harris, who refused Minelli's attempts at bribery, attempts to bring in outside money to pay the IOUs the city has been giving its workers. He also asks that Blankman be there to protect the people and receive a special award. As the money is released, Minelli's henchmen storm the bank and take the mayor hostage, threatening to detonate explosives. At the police chief's request and the crowd's chants, Blankman attempts to save the mayor, but is unable to disarm all the bombs. He reveals his identity to the mayor and tells him of his grandmother's support for the mayor. Mayor Harris wishes him well, warning him to run and says he will tell Mrs. Walker about Darryl. Blankman runs out screaming as the bank explodes. The crowd, seeing his failure, turn on him, chasing him down the street.

286544On May 10, 1998, teenage amateur astronomer Leo Biederman  discovers an unusual object near the stars Mizar and Alcor at a star party in Richmond, Virginia. He alerts astronomer Marcus Wolf , who realizes that the object is a comet on a collision course with Earth, but dies in a car accident before he can alert the world. A year later, MSNBC reporter Jenny Lerner  investigates the resignation of the Secretary of the Treasury  and his connection to an ""Ellie"". She discovers that Ellie is not a mistress but an acronym: ""E.L.E."", for ""Extinction-Level Event"". Because of Lerner's investigation, President Tom Beck  advances the announcement of the grim facts: The comet, named Wolf-Biederman, is {{convert}} wide, large enough to destroy all life if it strikes Earth. The United States and Russia have been secretly constructing a spacecraft, the Messiah, in orbit. They plan to use it to transport a team lead by Captain Spurgeon Tanner  to the comet, so that it can be destroyed with nuclear weapons. After landing on the comet, the crew members plant nuclear bombs 100 meters beneath the surface. When the bombs are detonated, the ship is damaged and loses contact with Earth. Instead of being destroyed, the comet splits into two smaller rocks nicknamed ""Biederman""  and ""Wolf"" , both world-threatening. Beck announces the Messiah crew’s failure, declares martial law, and reveals that governments worldwide have been building underground shelters. The United States' shelter is in the limestone caves of Missouri. The US government conducts a lottery to select 800,000 ordinary Americans aged 50 and under to join 200,000 pre-selected scientists, engineers, teachers, artists, soldiers, and officials. Lerner and Leo's families are pre-selected, but Leo's girlfriend Sarah Hotchner  is not. Leo marries Sarah to save her family but the Hotchners are mistakenly left off the evacuee list; Sarah refuses to leave without them. A last-ditch effort to use Earth's missile-borne nuclear weapons to deflect the two chunks of the comet fails. Leo returns home looking for Sarah, but her family has left for the Appalachian Mountains and is trapped in a traffic jam on the highway. Sarah's parents urge Leo to take Sarah and her baby brother to high ground; Sarah still does not want to abandon her parents, but they convince her to let them go. Lerner gives up her seat in the last evacuation helicopter to her friend Beth, who has a young daughter. She instead joins her estranged father  at her childhood beach house, where they reconcile and remember happier times. The Biederman fragment impacts in the Atlantic Ocean near Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, creating a megatsunami. Leo, Sarah and her baby brother survive. Lerner, her father, Sarah's parents, and millions along the Atlantic coasts of North and South America, Europe, and Africa perish. The world braces for the impact of Wolf in western Canada, which will create a cloud of dust that will block out the sun for two years. This, in turn, will destroy all remaining life on the surface. Low on fuel and life support, the crew of the Messiah decides to undertake a suicide mission with the remaining nuclear warheads. After saying goodbye to their loved ones by video conference, the ship reaches the fragment and enters a fissure to blow itself up, which breaks Wolf into much smaller pieces, which burn up in Earth's atmosphere. President Beck, speaking to a large crowd in front of the United States Capitol building, which is undergoing reconstruction, urges the nation and the world to continue their recovery.

On his way home from school, Stuart saves a female canary named Margalo who is being pursued by a peregrine falcon, and they become friends. But she is secretly working with Falcon to case and steal from households. When he presses her to find and take an object of value, or lose the sanctuary he promised her, she can't seem to concentrate on her assignment, as she is beginning to fall in love with Stuart. Falcon eventually loses patience and threatens to kill him if she doesn't deliver. Worried for his safety, she takes Eleanor Little's diamond ring. When the Littles see that the ring is missing, they think it has fallen down the sink. Stuart offers to be lowered down the drain on a string to get it, and nearly succeeds. When it breaks Margalo saves him, and his thanks to her only makes her feel even more guilty, so she decides to leave. When he can't find her, he assumes she has been kidnapped - and that Falcon is somehow involved. He leaves on a quest to rescue her with the household's reluctant cat Snowbell, but not before setting up a plan with George.

On a garbage scow where he has ended up, Stuart blames himself for everything, and has almost lost all hope. Suddenly, he finds George's broken plane, fixes it up, and flies to save Margalo, who, having been freed by Snowbell, just fled from Falcon. The Littles, who have discovered his absence and whereabouts follow him by taxi as he begins an aerial adventure through the park, with Margalo at his side. They lose Falcon, but he catches up and makes an attempt to kill Stuart, when he detaches the plane's upper wing, damaging the main one and causing it to enter a steep nose dive, which fails when Stuart recovers from the dive, nearly missing the Littles. Unable to run from Falcon, he lets Margalo off. He turns and flies the damaged plane in a kamikaze run while Falcon goes into an attack dive. He uses Mrs. Little's ring to temporarily blind him, and jumps out using a bandana as a parachute. The kamikaze attack works and Falcon is struck head on and defeated. Although he survives the attack, he falls out of the sky and lands in a garbage can that Monty is scavenging in, and is presumably eaten by him, but not before Stuart falls when his parachute is sliced apart by the propeller of the shattered plane, and then is rescued by Margalo. Stuart is congratulated by his family, and Margalo, who gives Mrs. Little her ring back, and Snowbell reunites with them as well. That evening, Margalo leaves with the other birds to migrate south, but not before saying goodbye to her friends. Stuart says the ""silver lining"" is that she'll be back in the spring, and his baby sister, Martha, says her first words: ""Bye bye, birdie."", as the family head inside to the comfort of their home.

4731866White widow Bea Pullman  and her daughter Jessie  take in black housekeeper Delilah Johnson  and her daughter, light-complexioned Peola  — exchanging room and board for work, even though Bea is struggling to make ends meet herself. Delilah and Peola quickly become like family to Jessie and Bea. They particularly enjoy Delilah's pancakes, made from a special family recipe. Five years later, Jessie and Peola prove to be challenging children to raise: Jessie is demanding, not particularly studious, relying instead on her charm, and is the first person to call Peola ""black"" in a hurtful way, making it clear that their childhood idyll is doomed. Peola does not tell her classmates at school that she is ""colored"" and is humiliated when her mother shows up one day, revealing her secret. Bea finds it difficult to make a living selling pancake syrup . Using her wiles to get a store on the busy Atlantic City boardwalk refurbished for practically nothing, she opens a pancake restaurant on the boardwalk . Later, at the suggestion of a passerby, Elmer Smith , she sets up an even more successful pancake flour corporation, marketing Delilah as an Aunt Jemima-like figure. She gives Delilah a 20% interest in the business but Delilah continues to act as Bea's housekeeper. As a result, Bea becomes a wealthy business woman, but all is not well as the story advances ten years.  Eighteen-year-old Jessie , home on college vacation, falls in love with her mother's boyfriend, Stephen Archer , who is unaware at first of her affections. Meanwhile, Peola , ashamed of her African-American heritage, attempts to pass as white, breaking Delilah's heart. Peola runs away from her Negro college and takes a job as a cashier in a white store. When her mother and Bea track her down, she is again humiliated to be identified as black and ultimately tells her mother that she is going away, never to return, so she can pass as a white woman without the fear that Delilah will show up. Delilah is literally heartbroken and, in a melodramatic scene, takes to her bed and dies, murmuring Peola's name and forgiving her. The black servants are glimpsed singing a spiritual as she passes, Bea holding her hand at the end. Delilah's last wish had been for a large, grand funeral, complete with a marching band and a horse-drawn hearse. Just before the processional begins, a remorseful, crying Peola appears, begging her mother to forgive her. Peola returns to her Negro college and presumably abandons her efforts to pass as white. The film ends with Bea breaking her engagement with Stephen because of the situation with Jessie and doesn't want to hurt her feelings while being with him; although Bea promises to come find him once Jessie has forgotten him. The movie ends with Bea embracing Jessie while remembering Jessie's insistent demands for her toy duck  back when she was a toddler.

11385169Tom sneaks into the kitchen to the fridge. He grabs a whole chicken and takes a couple of bites out of it before he hears George coming his way. Tom hurriedly shoves the chicken back into the refrigerator and hides. George, upon discovering the half-eaten chicken, concludes that either Tom or Spike is guilty and is determined to figure out which, even if it means X-raying them. Panicked, Tom frames Spike; he creates phony ink footprints leading from the sleeping dog to the refrigerator. As Tom moves to plant the chicken on Spike, a bright light flashes, and Jerry, holding a camera, runs off. Joan and George see the ""evidence"" implicating Spike and kick him out of the house. Spike laments being framed as he watches George and Joan allow Tom to gobble down the remainder of the chicken. Meanwhile, Jerry emerges from his darkroom, having made numerous copies of his photo of Tom framing Spike. Jerry plants copies of the photos in places where George or Joan are likely to see them. Tom is forced to use the guise of being a recklessly playful cat as he swoops in to destroy the photos before George and/or Joan see them. To make matters worse, Tom taunts Spike from inside, leading George to think that the cat has gone crazy. Jerry begins folding the photos into paper airplanes and tosses them towards Joan in the kitchen and George in the den.

6542034The film begins after the 1997 British general election, where Tony Blair  becomes Britain's Labour prime minister. The Queen  is slightly wary of Blair and his pledge to ""modernise"" the country, but Blair promises to respect the Royal Family. Three months later, Diana, Princess of Wales dies in a car crash in the Alma Bridge tunnel in Paris along with her companion Dodi Fayed and driver Henri Paul. Blair's director of communications, Alastair Campbell , prepares a speech in which Diana is described as ""the people's princess"". Blair gives his speech the next day and the phrase catches on. Over the next few days, millions of people across London display an outpouring of grief at Buckingham and Kensington Palaces. Meanwhile, the Royal Family are still at Balmoral Castle, their summer estate in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. Diana's death sparks division among numerous members of the family. The Royal Family observes that, since Diana was divorced from her husband, Prince Charles  a year earlier, she is no longer a part of the family. They insist that Diana's funeral is a ""private affair"" and is best left to Diana's noble family, the Spencers. Charles argues that the mother of a future king cannot be dismissed so lightly, and the Queen allows the use of an aircraft of the British Royal Flight to bring Diana's body back to England. In London, flowers pile up along the palace railings, forcing the changing of the Queen's guard to use another gate. British tabloids become inflammatory about the lack of a statement from the Royal Family. Charles leaves no doubt that he shares Blair's views about the need for a statement. As the Royal Family's ratings plummet, Blair's popularity rises, to the delight of his anti-monarchist advisers and wife Cherie . However, Blair does not share these sentiments. While disagreeing with the Queen's course of action, Blair begins to develop an admiration for her. Blair disagrees with his wife's views and tells her that a republican Britain is ludicrous, and begins to denounce the anti-royal disdain of his Labour Party advisors. Blair calls the Queen at Balmoral and recommends strong measures to regain public confidence for the monarchy: attend a public funeral for Diana at Westminster Abbey, fly a Union flag at half mast over Buckingham Palace, and speak to the nation about Diana's life and legacy in a televised address. Blair's recommendations outrage several other members of the Royal Family including Prince Philip  and the Queen Mother . Philip is surprised that Elton John is asked to attend and sing a song, ""Candle in the Wind"" in Diana's memory. They view such steps as an undignified surrender to public hysteria. The Queen seems concerned about this and although she shares their feelings, she has doubts as she closely follows the news. The Queen believes that there has been a shift in public values and that perhaps she should abdicate. The Queen Mother dismisses the idea, saying that she is one of the greatest assets her monarchy has ever had, stating: ""The real problem will come when you leave"". She also reminds the Queen of the promise she made in Cape Town, South Africa on her 21st birthday, in which she promised that her ""whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong..."" Meanwhile, Philip attempts to distract William and Harry  from Diana's death by taking them deer stalking. While venturing out alone in her Land Rover, the Queen damages the vehicle while crossing a river and is forced to telephone for assistance. The Queen weeps in frustration, but catches sight of a majestic Red Deer which Philip, William, and Harry have been stalking. She is struck by his beauty and the two stare at each other. Hearing a distant gunshot, she shoos the animal away. The Queen decides to carry out Blair's recommendations. While preparing to return to London to attend Diana's public funeral, the Queen is horrified to learn that the deer has been killed on a neighbouring estate. She asks to see the stag and is upset at its loss. The Royal Family finally return to London to inspect the floral tributes, and while watching live television coverage along with his staff, Blair becomes angry and disappointed at his Labour Party advisors, for which he states that the Queen is admirable, and thinks that Diana had thrown everything she offered back in her face and seemed to destroy everything held most dear by the Queen. The Queen later follows Blair's advice and gives her public statement, speaking about Diana's life and legacy on live television and describing Diana as ""an exceptional and gifted human being"". Two months after Diana's death, Blair visits Buckingham Palace for a weekly meeting. The Queen finally regained her popularity, but she believes that Blair has benefited himself from her acquiescence to his advice and that she will never fully recover from ""that week"". The Queen cautions Blair that one day, he will find that public opinion can rapidly turn against him and declares that times have changed and that the monarchy must ""modernise"". When Blair suggests that he can help with this, the Queen replies: ""Don't get ahead of yourself, Prime Minister. Remember, I'm supposed to be the one advising you"".

1039551{{plot}} Darryl Walker  is a clumsy nerdy repairman, who is a genius. Darrel had a pure heart and an optimstic Pollyannish personality. He is childishly naive to the realities of living in an inner city neighborhood. The area suffers from political corruption and the police are on strike. It takes the murder of his grandmother, an avid supporter of Alderman Marvin Harris' anti corruption campaign for Mayor, by members of mobster Michael Minelli to awaken him to the realities of his city's urban decay. He expresses his frustrations by intervening in a situation and boldly saving an elderly transit passenger from being mugged, and by ranting about the general corruptible state that the city has become. Darryl was so pure and shielded from reality presumably because of his interest in inventing, that he does not even realize that there is a ""crackhouse in front of our flat"". He tries to storm into it unarmed and rebuke the gang members, oblivious to the hazardous stupidity of doing so. Awareness to the city's issues inspires Darryl to become Blankman. He uses his technical expertise to create weapons and gadgets. His brother Kevin, a tabloid news cameraman, goes along with this fantasy believing that it's Darryl's way to cope with the murder of his grandmother. He demands an audience with the police commissioner, but the police are not impressed with his actions, ridicule him, and arrest him for disturbing the peace. Darryl is released on orders to see a shrink. The shrink calls Darryl normal, but a geek, infuriating Kevin, who the shrink then attempts to psychoanalyze. After Darryl is nearly killed trying to protect a citizen on the street, Kevin tries to get him to tone his activities down, advising him to start a neighborhood watch. After he delivers a woman's baby in an elevator, he is asked for his name. Darryl just stares, and Kevin replies, ""He's gone blank, ma'am."" Both the lady and the reporters interpret this as a name: Blankman. Over time he protects various other people in the community, building up a reputation and inspiring both the town and other real life superheroes. Kevin, hoping to win the affections of Kimberly Jonz, a reporter at his TV station, begs Darryl to allow her to interview him. He relents, on the condition that she wear a carnation. He brings her to his secret hideout, an abandoned subway station, and they talk about how he took up his duties to memorialize his grandmother and prevent crime. Impressed by his heroics and modesty, Kimberly immediately falls in love with Darryl and she kisses him causing him to have an erection. Mayor Harris, who refused Minelli's attempts at bribery, attempts to bring in outside money to pay the IOUs the city has been giving its workers. He also asks that Blankman be there to protect the people and receive a special award. As the money is released, Minelli's henchmen storm the bank and take the mayor hostage, threatening to detonate explosives. At the police chief's request and the crowd's chants, Blankman attempts to save the mayor, but is unable to disarm all the bombs. He reveals his identity to the mayor and tells him of his grandmother's support for the mayor. Mayor Harris wishes him well, warning him to run and says he will tell Mrs. Walker about Darryl. Blankman runs out screaming as the bank explodes. The crowd, seeing his failure, turn on him, chasing him down the street. Darryl then gives up his heroic works for a normal life, getting a job at a McDonald's. Wanting a great story Kevin's boss Jason Stone, a tabloid news junkie, manages to contact Minelli and trades knowledge of Blankman's love for Kimberly in exchange for an exclusive interview. In the midst of doing research on Minelli and Darryl's grandmother's death, Kimberly calls Kevin with the news. As Kevin answers, Minelli takes Kimberly hostage. Minelli issues a verbal threat to Kevin , telling him he will kill Kimberly if Blankman does not show up. Kevin rushes to Darryl's workplace with the news, but Darryl refuses to help wanting a normal life. Kevin finally convinces him with the news that Minelli had their grandmother killed and that he will wear the costume Darryl designed for him. The two rush to Darryl's underground lair where he again turns into Blankman. Kevin becomes his new sidekick but without a name. He just goes by ""Other Guy"". The two heroes then rush to the TV station. After shooting the reporter interviewing him, Minelli becomes fed up. While threatening Stone, Blankman and Other Guy crash through the window and attempt a rescue. The two engage in a fight with Minelli's goons, losing. They are placed in a water tank and left to slowly drown. Stone and Kimberly are chained to desks and left to die as Minelli has hidden bombs in the building. At this point, Blankman calls in J-5, his robot assistant, to save them. J-5 drills a hole in the tank and the pair kick their way to freedom at the last minute. The duo then search for the bombs, finding them in a women's bathroom. Activating J-5's ""bomb disposal mode,"" Blankman stuffs the explosives inside and frees Kimberly. Stone is left behind, a joke Other Guy wants to play on his boss. Once outside, the explosives detonate, destroying J-5. Distraught, Blankman swears revenge. Tracking Minelli to his hideout in a factory, the two prepare for the final battle. Other Guy, however, is overconfident and is wounded because his costume is not bulletproof like Darryl's. Blankman then defeats Minelli's goons with his electric ""newchucks"" . Just when Minelli is about to kill Other Guy, Blankman activates his jet-powered roller blades and captures Minelli and delivers him to the police. Blankman is once again acknowledged as a hero  by the people, receiving the Mayor Harris Award for outstanding community service at a ceremony in their honor. Other Guy receives a Blankman t-shirt . After the ceremony, Kevin introduces Kimberly to ""Darryl."" The two make light conversation until Kimberly pretends to see a purse snatcher, putting Darryl on alert. Kimberly then reveals she knows that they are Blankman and Other Guy, and she kisses Darryl to prove it. Darryl falls to the ground after getting the same embarrassing reaction he had the first time while Kevin and Kimberly laugh at him. The film ends with a shot of a banner that reads ""We Love You Blankman...and the Other Guy"".

31079After planning and coordinating another successful wedding ceremony, San Francisco wedding planner Mary  is re-introduced to childhood acquaintance Massimo  by her father  who wants the two of them to marry. Mary, however, is not impressed and instead remains focused on her ambition to become a partner at the wedding company she works for. As a way to persuade her boss, Geri , to accept her as a partner, Mary pursues and is hired by catering heiress, Fran Donolly  to plan her society wedding to long term boyfriend ‘Eddie’. While on the phone reporting her success Mary’s shoe heel gets stuck in a manhole cover. While she attempts to free herself a taxi collides with a dumpster and it comes hurtling towards her. A man standing nearby rushes in and pulls her away just before the dumpster crashes. Mary manages to thank the man before fainting. She later wakes up in hospital and the man who saved her is revealed to be the local pediatrician, Steve Edison . When Mary’s friend and colleague Penny  arrives she persuades Steve to attend an outdoor movie screening with them at the park, only to make up an excuse to leave the pair alone. At the movie Mary and Steve dance but as they are about to kiss a heavy downpour forces them to run for cover. A few days later Mary and Fran are at another of Mary’s weddings and Fran teases her for her dreamy look before Mary tells her about her movie date. Later on Mary is attending a dance lesson with another of her clients. Fran is also attending and introduces Mary to her fiancé ‘Eddie’ who turns out to be Steve. When Fran leaves the pair to dance together Mary angrily rebukes him for leading her on and going behind Fran’s back. Mary is left wondering whether she should continue to plan Fran and Steve’s wedding, while Steve is left wondering whether his chemistry with Mary is a sign that he shouldn’t be marrying Fran. Penny persuades Mary that her career is more important than whatever attraction she might have felt for Steve and Steve’s colleague persuades him that the connection he had with Mary was just the result of pre-wedding nerves. When they arrive at a potential wedding venue in Napa Valley, Massimo appears and, to Mary's confusion and horror, introduces himself as her fiancé. Later when the four of them, along with Fran’s parents, are riding on horseback through the estate, Mrs Donolly’s singing frightens Mary’s horse and it rushes off with a terrified Mary clinging on. Steve instantly gallops after Mary and rescues her from the out of control horse. When the pair are alone he bitterly rebukes her for condemning his actions when she was also engaged. At home, Mary’s father excitedly talks about her upcoming wedding, only for her to reveal that she and Massimo are not engaged before scolding her father for trying to arrange her marriage. Her father then reveals that his wedding with her mother, which Mary had always seen as the perfect marriage, was actually arranged and only became a loving relationship months later, leaving Mary feeling very confused. Mary, Fran and Steve visit another potential wedding venue. Differences in opinion between the couple begin to emerge but Steve agrees with whatever makes Fran happy.

Mary reveals that Keith was her fiancé, Wendy was his high-school girlfriend and during their rehearsal dinner she found them making out in her car. That night a drunk Mary laments over Keith being married and expecting a baby while she is still alone and miserable. Steve comforts her and insists that Keith was a fool to pick Wendy over her. He then leaves but quickly returns and confesses that he has feelings for Mary. She sadly replies that she respects Fran too much to let anything happen between them and sends Steve away. Fran returns early from her trip and comes to speak with Mary. Mary fears that Steve has revealed his feelings for her but instead Fran reveals she doesn’t know if she is in love with Steve anymore.

The pair part as friends and Fran leaves to go on their honeymoon alone. Penny reveals Mary’s plans to Steve and he rushes off to stop her. At the town hall, Massimo and Mary prepare to marry but her father stops the ceremony, realising that the wedding is what he wants for her and not what she wants. Mary, who has given up on true love, insists that life isn’t a fairytale and marrying Massimo is the right thing to do. Steve arrives to find Mary’s father and Massimo outside. Massimo reveals that he couldn’t go ahead with the wedding knowing that Mary was not in love with him and actually in love with Steve.

4731866White widow Bea Pullman  and her daughter Jessie  take in black housekeeper Delilah Johnson  and her daughter, light-complexioned Peola  — exchanging room and board for work, even though Bea is struggling to make ends meet herself. Delilah and Peola quickly become like family to Jessie and Bea. They particularly enjoy Delilah's pancakes, made from a special family recipe. Five years later, Jessie and Peola prove to be challenging children to raise: Jessie is demanding, not particularly studious, relying instead on her charm, and is the first person to call Peola ""black"" in a hurtful way, making it clear that their childhood idyll is doomed. Peola does not tell her classmates at school that she is ""colored"" and is humiliated when her mother shows up one day, revealing her secret. Bea finds it difficult to make a living selling pancake syrup . Using her wiles to get a store on the busy Atlantic City boardwalk refurbished for practically nothing, she opens a pancake restaurant on the boardwalk . Later, at the suggestion of a passerby, Elmer Smith , she sets up an even more successful pancake flour corporation, marketing Delilah as an Aunt Jemima-like figure. She gives Delilah a 20% interest in the business but Delilah continues to act as Bea's housekeeper. As a result, Bea becomes a wealthy business woman, but all is not well as the story advances ten years.  Eighteen-year-old Jessie , home on college vacation, falls in love with her mother's boyfriend, Stephen Archer , who is unaware at first of her affections. Meanwhile, Peola , ashamed of her African-American heritage, attempts to pass as white, breaking Delilah's heart. Peola runs away from her Negro college and takes a job as a cashier in a white store. When her mother and Bea track her down, she is again humiliated to be identified as black and ultimately tells her mother that she is going away, never to return, so she can pass as a white woman without the fear that Delilah will show up. Delilah is literally heartbroken and, in a melodramatic scene, takes to her bed and dies, murmuring Peola's name and forgiving her. The black servants are glimpsed singing a spiritual as she passes, Bea holding her hand at the end. Delilah's last wish had been for a large, grand funeral, complete with a marching band and a horse-drawn hearse. Just before the processional begins, a remorseful, crying Peola appears, begging her mother to forgive her. Peola returns to her Negro college and presumably abandons her efforts to pass as white. The film ends with Bea breaking her engagement with Stephen because of the situation with Jessie and doesn't want to hurt her feelings while being with him; although Bea promises to come find him once Jessie has forgotten him. The movie ends with Bea embracing Jessie while remembering Jessie's insistent demands for her toy duck  back when she was a toddler.

When Vallabhi  was attacked by the Maan Mori in a battle attempt, Rawal Mahendra-II died and his queen Pushpawati somehow escaped from that attack and went to Nagda area . Later she died, giving her child to a Brahmin family. The son of the queen Pushpawati grew young and was popularly known as Bappa Rawal . One day Bappa Rawal met Maharshi Harti Rashi  and by the profound blessings of the sage Harit Rashi, Bappa established the Great kingdom of Mewar. Narrator Kaviraj Shyamaldas proceeds further in the story as- Rana Ratan Singh's wife queen Padmini, who was an iconic paramount of beauty in historical times, faced bad consequences due to Allauddin Khilji's intrigue and deception of forceful control over Chittorgarh as well as over queen Padmini. At the end the conflict between Padmini and Allauddhin Khilji led the last queen Padmini to sacrifice herself for the self-respect and honor of the dynasty by jumping alive in the heap of fire inside the palace at fort Chittor . Narrator Kaviraj Shyamaldas's pen stops at the incident of king Udai Singh's feeding mother Panna Gurjari. The maid's son Banveer  who killed Rana Vikramaditya, was intending to kill Udai Singh in his childhood as well. Pannadhay then sacrificed her own son who was at the same age of Udai Singh and Banveer killed her son by having an impression that sleeping child is Udai Singh. She saw her own son dying in front of her eyes. This sacrifice of Pannadhay is remembered in the history, which ultimately saved the dynasty of Mewar. As the story goes further. Maharana Udai Singh, father of Maharana Pratap was compelled to depart the fort of Chittorgarh. On the other hand, queen Jaiwnti bai who was the first wife of Maharana Udai Singh was facing ignoring attitude by Udai Singh. The Maharana Udai Singh was immensely fascinated towards queen Bhattiyani. The diplomatic queen Bhattiyani passionately devised a plan to establish Jagmal  on the throne of Mewar so as to make him the king. After the death of Udai Singh, the elder son Pratap was not offered the royal seat of the kingdom of Mewar. In the meantime all the noble heads came to know about Jagamal being made the heir. Apparently ministers within the kingdom discussed the dismissal of Jagmal. Rawat Krishna Das and Rawat Sanga suggested that “pratap is the eldest son, and worthy also, hence, he should be the Maharana.” After completing the last rites, the noble chieftains helped Pratap to occupy the Royal Throne and spoke to Jagamal – “In your capacity as the younger brother, your seat is in front of the Royal Throne”. Thus, on 28 feb, 1572; Pratap's coronation was performed at Gogunda  just after the funeral pyre of Udai Singh. Pratap's coronation was held at Rana Bawari and he was enthroned on royal seat of the kingdom of Mewar unanimously in 1572. Maharana Pratap was leading forward with his knighthood, chivalry and art of battling; at the same time emperor Jalal ud-Din Muhammad Akbar of Mughal dynasty  was now ready to tackle the conflict in the form of a battle. However as a diplomat, his strategy was to avoid the battle and motivate other kings to surrender in front of him, but Maharana Pratap was an exception. Pratap won the battle of Gorwar. Akbar with his kingdom oriented strategies sent many proposals to Mewar as Akbar was of the opinion that Mewar is the biggest hurdle in the path of expanding the domain of his kingdom. A special delegation was sent by Akbar thrice to persuade and convince Maharana Pratap that he shall accept the Mughal rule and Mewar should work under Akbar's imperial kingdom. The special deligation consisted of Rana Bhagwandas, Todermal and Man Singh. They requested Maharna Pratap to accept Akbar's proposal. When Kunwar Man Singh of Amber came to Udaipur. There was a grand dinner organized at the bank of lake Udaisagar. But Maharana Pratap decided not to attend that dinner. Pratap sent his son Kunwar Amar Singh to dine with Kunwar Man Singh, which ultimately led to an argument between Dodhia Bhim & Man Singh. This incident precipitated the Mughal-Mewar conflict. Aftermath of this argumentation was the battle of Haldighati. Battle of Haldighati The Mughals marched south towards the village of Haldighati where a pass accessed the terrain of Pratap Singh and his temporary capital of Kumbhalgarh. Emperor Akbar decided to fight a battle and invaded Mewar. Emperor Akbar sent Man Singh as a Chief of his Imperial army and this incident is popularly known as the battle of Haldighati. It took place on 18 June 1576. In the month of June with boiling temperature, battle started in the narrow path of valley. Pratap attacked on Man Singh but he hid himself under the shelter of seating stands on elephant rider, thereby only rider was killed. In this battle Hakim Khan Suri, Rawat Netsingh, Jhala Maan, Jhala Bida, Gwalior's king Raamshah Tanwar, Nalwahan, Shaliwahan were killed as martyrs. Here Pratap was surrounded by Mughal imperial army, at the same time Jhala Maan traded the crown with Pratap. Jhala Maan set a unique example of loyalty, bravery and courage by sacrificing his life to save the life of Pratap. Jhala Maan holding royal insignia urged Pratap to leave the battlefield. Pratap's horse Chetak was wounded by the sword, which was hidden in the trunk of Man Singh's elephant. Ultimately Chetak died while crossing the terrain. Chetak equally shares the respect that has been given to the legendary warrior Maharana Pratap in the history. In the textbooks the battle ends within three hours of a short span, but the fact is that the battle of Haldighati which started on 18 June 1576, actually carried about a month long and ended at Gogunda. The battle was truly a symbol of the raw courage, an epitome towards nation's love, spirit of sacrifice and loyalty of the Rajputs towards the defence of their motherland. It was one of the toughest times for Mughal army as they were compelled to eat unripe mangoes and horse's meat and were forced to leave Mewar at last. Maharana Pratap displayed indomitable courage and bravery in the battle of Haldighati, he won the battle of Haldighati finally displaying the apocalyptic and splendiferous attitude of a true knight. Akbar invaded the land of Mewar many times but Rana Kika  never surrendered in front of him. Under the leadership of Shahbaz Khan, Mewar was invaded umpteen number of times but Pratap escaped from every attempt of Mughals. In the Diwer valley, enormous battle took place between Mughals and Mewar. Maharana Pratap confronted 40 Mughal's cantonment and Mughal army faced extreme defeat. At the end Maharana Pratap established the capital of Mewar named 'Chawand' in Mewar area and promoted agriculture, music & art. Further leading towards success in his serene, sublime and peaceful kingdom. There came an immense tragic and disheartening day in the life of Pratap when while tightening the string of a bow with arrow, a muscle contracted in the intestine causing internal bleeding. Pratap fell down on the surface and died in Chawand.

34180770	/m/0hq_s4v	Nee Thodu Kavali				"{""/m/09s02"": ""Telugu language""}"	{}	"{""/m/02l7c8"": ""Romance Film""}"	The story of Maharana Pratap starts from the narrator Kaviraj Shyamaldas who narrates the cepi of Maharana Pratap and initiates the history of Mewar kingdom. When Vallabhi  was attacked by the Maan Mori in a battle attempt, Rawal Mahendra-II died and his queen Pushpawati somehow escaped from that attack and went to Nagda area . Later she died, giving her child to a Brahmin family. The son of the queen Pushpawati grew young and was popularly known as Bappa Rawal . One day Bappa Rawal met Maharshi Harti Rashi  and by the profound blessings of the sage Harit Rashi, Bappa established the Great kingdom of Mewar. Narrator Kaviraj Shyamaldas proceeds further in the story as- Rana Ratan Singh's wife queen Padmini, who was an iconic paramount of beauty in historical times, faced bad consequences due to Allauddin Khilji's intrigue and deception of forceful control over Chittorgarh as well as over queen Padmini. At the end the conflict between Padmini and Allauddhin Khilji led the last queen Padmini to sacrifice herself for the self-respect and honor of the dynasty by jumping alive in the heap of fire inside the palace at fort Chittor . Narrator Kaviraj Shyamaldas's pen stops at the incident of king Udai Singh's feeding mother Panna Gurjari. The maid's son Banveer  who killed Rana Vikramaditya, was intending to kill Udai Singh in his childhood as well. Pannadhay then sacrificed her own son who was at the same age of Udai Singh and Banveer killed her son by having an impression that sleeping child is Udai Singh. She saw her own son dying in front of her eyes. This sacrifice of Pannadhay is remembered in the history, which ultimately saved the dynasty of Mewar. As the story goes further. Maharana Udai Singh, father of Maharana Pratap was compelled to depart the fort of Chittorgarh. On the other hand, queen Jaiwnti bai who was the first wife of Maharana Udai Singh was facing ignoring attitude by Udai Singh. The Maharana Udai Singh was immensely fascinated towards queen Bhattiyani. The diplomatic queen Bhattiyani passionately devised a plan to establish Jagmal  on the throne of Mewar so as to make him the king. After the death of Udai Singh, the elder son Pratap was not offered the royal seat of the kingdom of Mewar. In the meantime all the noble heads came to know about Jagamal being made the heir. Apparently ministers within the kingdom discussed the dismissal of Jagmal. Rawat Krishna Das and Rawat Sanga suggested that “pratap is the eldest son, and worthy also, hence, he should be the Maharana.” After completing the last rites, the noble chieftains helped Pratap to occupy the Royal Throne and spoke to Jagamal – “In your capacity as the younger brother, your seat is in front of the Royal Throne”. Thus, on 28 feb, 1572; Pratap's coronation was performed at Gogunda  just after the funeral pyre of Udai Singh. Pratap's coronation was held at Rana Bawari and he was enthroned on royal seat of the kingdom of Mewar unanimously in 1572. Maharana Pratap was leading forward with his knighthood, chivalry and art of battling; at the same time emperor Jalal ud-Din Muhammad Akbar of Mughal dynasty  was now ready to tackle the conflict in the form of a battle. However as a diplomat, his strategy was to avoid the battle and motivate other kings to surrender in front of him, but Maharana Pratap was an exception. Pratap won the battle of Gorwar. Akbar with his kingdom oriented strategies sent many proposals to Mewar as Akbar was of the opinion that Mewar is the biggest hurdle in the path of expanding the domain of his kingdom. A special delegation was sent by Akbar thrice to persuade and convince Maharana Pratap that he shall accept the Mughal rule and Mewar should work under Akbar's imperial kingdom. The special deligation consisted of Rana Bhagwandas, Todermal and Man Singh. They requested Maharna Pratap to accept Akbar's proposal. When Kunwar Man Singh of Amber came to Udaipur. There was a grand dinner organized at the bank of lake Udaisagar. But Maharana Pratap decided not to attend that dinner. Pratap sent his son Kunwar Amar Singh to dine with Kunwar Man Singh, which ultimately led to an argument between Dodhia Bhim & Man Singh. This incident precipitated the Mughal-Mewar conflict. Aftermath of this argumentation was the battle of Haldighati. Battle of Haldighati The Mughals marched south towards the village of Haldighati where a pass accessed the terrain of Pratap Singh and his temporary capital of Kumbhalgarh. Emperor Akbar decided to fight a battle and invaded Mewar. Emperor Akbar sent Man Singh as a Chief of his Imperial army and this incident is popularly known as the battle of Haldighati. It took place on 18 June 1576. In the month of June with boiling temperature, battle started in the narrow path of valley. Pratap attacked on Man Singh but he hid himself under the shelter of seating stands on elephant rider, thereby only rider was killed. In this battle Hakim Khan Suri, Rawat Netsingh, Jhala Maan, Jhala Bida, Gwalior's king Raamshah Tanwar, Nalwahan, Shaliwahan were killed as martyrs. Here Pratap was surrounded by Mughal imperial army, at the same time Jhala Maan traded the crown with Pratap. Jhala Maan set a unique example of loyalty, bravery and courage by sacrificing his life to save the life of Pratap. Jhala Maan holding royal insignia urged Pratap to leave the battlefield. Pratap's horse Chetak was wounded by the sword, which was hidden in the trunk of Man Singh's elephant. Ultimately Chetak died while crossing the terrain. Chetak equally shares the respect that has been given to the legendary warrior Maharana Pratap in the history. In the textbooks the battle ends within three hours of a short span, but the fact is that the battle of Haldighati which started on 18 June 1576, actually carried about a month long and ended at Gogunda. The battle was truly a symbol of the raw courage, an epitome towards nation's love, spirit of sacrifice and loyalty of the Rajputs towards the defence of their motherland. It was one of the toughest times for Mughal army as they were compelled to eat unripe mangoes and horse's meat and were forced to leave Mewar at last.

In the almost silent opening to the film, Rui Pedro drives from one of the big cities of Mozambique, perhaps Beira, out to Bué Maria, where he spent his childhood and adolescence. There he finds the ruins of a house, which we later realize is the house in which he and his family once lived. Rui Pedro pitches camp by the river, where he encounters a young shepherd boy. Though the boy cannot speak Portuguese, Rui Pedro shares food and a cigarette with him. This meeting between the older white mana the young black boy foreshadows the relationship between Rui Pedro and Jacopo, the ferryman from his childhood. His visit recalls memories of his adolescence, and in particular a set of incidents that took place when he was fourteen and home from school for the summer break from school, dramatic incidence which would mark his life. The son of Portuguese colonists living amongst a small community of whites at a remote outpost in the bus, Rui Pedro has grown up shuttling between two ways of life, the European mores of his family and the African traditions of the workers his father manages. His life has wavered between the two banks of the nearby Pungue river, between the culture of the white settlers and that of the black natives, between the boss and the slaves, between violence and peace, between love and passion. After the Second World War, at a time when the other European powers were reluctantly making ready to decolonize, Portugal stepped up its involvement in its African territories. In Light Drops, as the colonial cotton company Rui Pedro's father works for forces through a bumper cotton harvest, much to the detriment of the local population. This exploitation at a general level is echoed in the relationship between Rui Pedro's cousin and his family's maid Ana, who is betrothed to Guinda, a local mechanic and froe. The violent end to their relationship foreshadows the violence to come in Mozambique.

A squirrel merrily runs around and heads to the groundhog's house to tell the latter of the good news. Upon coming out and hearing what the squirrel told him, the groundhog turned around and was surprised to see his shadow on the wall of his house. He then warns the squirrel and the other animals nearby that if his shadow is visible, more days of snow await. The other animals, however, were doubtful of his advice and therefore took it as a joke. On another part of the countryside, Oswald and an unnamed sister of his are working on their inn after it had been closed for the winter. They dust the furniture and shake the dirt off the carpets. After completing their tasks, the inn was ready for service. Oswald and his sister went outside for a little stroll. As the two inn operators are at the open and spending time with some animals, the groundhog approached and warn them once more about more winter days coming. Again, they all thought it was just a bluff and began to laugh. But they would stop laughing when snowflakes fall to the ground. Finally realizing the truth of the groundhog's warning, everybody hurried back indoors.

After space station Alpha-Two reports impossible ""negative radiation"" readings and loses contact with United Democracies  headquarters, Captain Tice and his crew are sent to investigate. They find the Alpha-Two crew immobilized, some dead, before coming under attack themselves by green glowing energy beings. The creatures immobilize Tice's team and the space station disappears entirely. On space station Gamma-One, Commander Halstead sends ships to investigate the remaining space stations and evacuates all but a skeleton crew. Meanwhile on Earth, the creatures have possessed Captain Dubois and use him to break into the Institute for Advanced Sciences's nuclear reactor. The possessed Dubois sends the U.D. a message offering ""symbiotic partnership"" for ""the good of the whole"". As the energy beings seize each of the stations and surround the Earth, Dubois relays the demands of the energy beings. Halstead and his crew are taken to Mars where they find the missing stations and the alien base at an automated uranium mine. Exploring the area, they discover the corpses of several Delta-Two crew members who failed to merge with the energy beings because of their ""passion and emotion"". Dubois reveals that the beings are ""Diaphinoids"" from the Andromeda Galaxy who need humans as host bodies. Halstead and his team are forced to watch a ""hosting"" ceremony which results in several more deaths. They rescue a pair of female station crew then start a melee with their captors. Opening a panel in the outer wall, they escape across the surface of Mars to a nearby spacecraft while the air vents from the base, killing all inside. The U.D. fleet arrives to bomb the base but Halstead's ship can't liftoff on its own. Unwilling to let the Diaphinoids escape, Halstead demands the fleet drop its bombs even though it will almost certainly kill them too. Luckily, they are able to use the blast from the U.D. attack to help loft the ship safely into orbit. Back on Earth, Halstead is awarded the U.D. Medal of Honor... and court martialed for dereliction of duty."

After space station Alpha-Two reports impossible ""negative radiation"" readings and loses contact with United Democracies  headquarters, Captain Tice and his crew are sent to investigate. They find the Alpha-Two crew immobilized, some dead, before coming under attack themselves by green glowing energy beings. The creatures immobilize Tice's team and the space station disappears entirely. On space station Gamma-One, Commander Halstead sends ships to investigate the remaining space stations and evacuates all but a skeleton crew. Meanwhile on Earth, the creatures have possessed Captain Dubois and use him to break into the Institute for Advanced Sciences's nuclear reactor. The possessed Dubois sends the U.D. a message offering ""symbiotic partnership"" for ""the good of the whole"". As the energy beings seize each of the stations and surround the Earth, Dubois relays the demands of the energy beings. Halstead and his crew are taken to Mars where they find the missing stations and the alien base at an automated uranium mine. Exploring the area, they discover the corpses of several Delta-Two crew members who failed to merge with the energy beings because of their ""passion and emotion"". Dubois reveals that the beings are ""Diaphinoids"" from the Andromeda Galaxy who need humans as host bodies. Halstead and his team are forced to watch a ""hosting"" ceremony which results in several more deaths. They rescue a pair of female station crew then start a melee with their captors. Opening a panel in the outer wall, they escape across the surface of Mars to a nearby spacecraft while the air vents from the base, killing all inside. The U.D. fleet arrives to bomb the base but Halstead's ship can't liftoff on its own. Unwilling to let the Diaphinoids escape, Halstead demands the fleet drop its bombs even though it will almost certainly kill them too. Luckily, they are able to use the blast from the U.D. attack to help loft the ship safely into orbit. Back on Earth, Halstead is awarded the U.D. Medal of Honor... and court martialed for dereliction of duty."

He spends his days cruising parks and saunas for casual sex or prostituting to high-paying clients making their sexual fantasies come true. Upfront with both his sexuality and his hustling ways to everybody, Dale's hard exterior is a mask to hide his very fragile shattered interior. He has developed a rampant imagination and fantasies of his own that he resorts to in many situations he is in. Dale is longing for his best friend since childhood, the ""straight"" Raj  and has developed very romantic feelings towards him. Dale is shocked when Raj asks him to become his best man at a hastily arranged wedding with Veena Entertainment Focus: Review of Cost of Love a children's teacher.

Besides Raj, the other main character in the film is Sean  who is Dale's confidant and has an obvious crush on him. Sean has to deal with Christine . There is also Ricardo  who is a Brazilian hunk escort and friend of Dale, and a partner in many of his hustling acts.

Shashi quickly emerges as amongst the most promising and committed students in her class. In midst of all this, she also finds Laurent getting attracted to her plain simple personality. Meanwhile, Shashi's niece finds out about her secret English classes and supports and helps her in her literary pursuit. Shashi starts watching English films at night and doing her homework religiously - all to polish her English reading and writing skills and more importantly to earn respect that she duly deserves from her family. To complete the English speaking course each of the student must take a final test, as announced by her teacher David Fischer. The test is a 5 minute speech that each student should prepare and deliver which will be judged by the tutor who will then issue the certificate. Shashi's family joins her in New York earlier than expected, as a surprise. This makes it difficult for Shashi to attend the classes and prepare for her final test. The test date coincides with the wedding date so she misses the test. Shashi's niece invites her English teacher and all her friends at the English speaking class to the wedding. At the wedding, Shashi gives the speech , more of a toast to the couple at the wedding and stuns everyone. The English tutor, who is present amongst the guests, declares that she has passed the test with distinction and issues her the certificate. Shashi's husband and daughter finally realize their mistake of mocking her lack of proficiency in English and taking her for granted. Shashi thanks Laurent for ""making her feel better about herself"". The movie ends with the Shashi's family returning to India. On the flight Shashi requests  if the stewardess has any Hindi newspapers."

Fifteen years later, Devin escapes, just as a figure in a red mask begins committing a series of seemingly random murders, the victims including two teenagers, an orderly, and a pair of police officers. After a Christmas Eve play headed by Devin's sisters, Taylor and Noel, is finished at the community centre, Noel's boyfriend Steve is killed. The next morning, the Merriman sisters receive a call from their mother, who demands they come to the community centre. Concerned with their mother's odd behavior as of late, the girls call the police before heading out. Arriving at the centre first is Detective Hughes, who is confronted and stabbed by the hysterical Mrs. Merriman. When Taylor and Noel arrive, they find the bodies of all the recent victims seated at a table in a mockery of The Last Supper, and their mother and Devin, the latter claiming that Mrs. Merriman is the killer of their father and everyone else, and that she framed him due to being a misandrist; the girls at first refuse to believe Devin, until they notice the blood coating their mother's arms. When Mrs. Merriman pulls out a knife, Devin disarms her, but she manages to grab Detective Hughes's dropped gun. Before Mrs. Merriman can fire it, Taylor wrestles the gun away from her, and shoots her in the head when she charges forward.

Upon her arrival in California, she meets Jim , a Chinese ""wife trader"" who sells her to Hong King , a successful Chinese merchant who lives in a rural Idaho mining town. The two set off on the long journey to Idaho and eventually strike up a friendship along the way. When they finally arrive in the rough, isolated town, she is distraught to discover that she is not going to be Hong King's wife. Instead, she is to work in his saloon as his newest prostitute under a new name, ""China Polly."" She is further dismayed when Jim abruptly disappears, leaving her to fend for herself. The following night, when Hong King tries to sell her virtue to the highest bidder, Lalu violently refuses to submit to her would-be suitors and successfully avoids becoming a prostitute, thanks in part to the intervention of a kind stranger, Charlie Bemis , who turns out to be Hong King's Caucasian partner. She placates a furious Hong King and convinces him to allow her to be his servant and saloon maid in order to repay the cost of her purchase. Hong King agrees to let her buy her freedom for the impossible sum of a thousand pieces of gold. Polly, as Lalu comes to be known, endures great hardship. At one point she is sexually assaulted by Hong King. However, she refuses to give up. She works hard and makes friends with the local townspeople. She also grows closer to Charlie, who begins to fall deeply in love with her. Meanwhile, Hong King is beset with financial problems and decides to sell Polly to the highest bidder. In a rare stroke of luck, Charlie wins her in a game of poker. She moves in with him but insists they remain platonic and keep separate quarters. Jim comes back and wants her to be with him but he then leaves her again when he finds out that she is living with Charlie. The ""white demons"" begin to run out the Chinese people from their town so it will be a purely white town and the Chinese will stop getting all of the gold. Polly works in many jobs for herself and saves money to go back to China and her family but she ultimately ends up falling in love with Charlie. She marries him and lives the rest of her life with him in a different area so she would not be harassed by the white demons anymore."

The driver finds this suspicious and prepares to drive off, but the truck is suddenly attacked by masked robbers. The driver tries to make a break for it, but his partner is revealed to be in on the heist. They execute the driver when an alarm in the truck goes off, and then his partner when he questions the lead robber's motives. After the heist, local law enforcement have created road blocks in search of the robbers. The four robbers, Marek, his girlfriend Arielle, Losada, and getaway driver Evers know that they fit the profile of the robbers and so, to prevent themselves from being caught, hide the $4 million in a sleeping bag belonging to a family of four who are on a camping trip. They manage to hide the bag full of money in the family's camping gear on top of their Land Rover while the family uses restrooms at a small gas station. Both the robbers and the family drive off and arrive at the road blockade. The robbers are immediately pulled over by the police and their vehicle is searched. As it is, the family passes through the blockade with no trouble. Aside from a police scanner belonging to Marek, the police are unable to find any incriminating evidence against them and let them go. The robbers catch up to the family in their black Chevelle. The father, Nate  notices the Chevelle coming up behind him very fast. He tries to outrun the vehicle, but a police car detects his speed and pulls him over. The robbers manage to get away because Arielle detected the cruiser with the scanner. Nate tries to tell the officer the Chevelle was chasing him, but the patrolman insists because they were following him at great speed, it allowed them to get away with it. Because of Louisiana state law, Nate is given a misdemeanour for reckless driving. Nate pleads with the officer not to give him the ticket because it will violate his parole, having spent the last 18 months in jail because of real estate fraud he committed. When he innocently begs the patrolman further, he is arrested and taken to the police station. Meanwhile, his wife Robyn  and his two sons Shane  and Kenny  drive to a motel to spend the night while await Nate's release. Nate is put in a cell block for the night. Back at the motel, the robbers invade Robyn's motel room and attack her. She locks herself in the bathroom door, then escapes through the bathroom window. The robbers are forced to leave when they learn the police are on their way. Marek is frustrated they didn't find the money in Robyn's room and gets angered further when Evers revealed the family had two motel rooms, insisting the bag must have been in the other room. The police arrive on scene, and bring Nate along once learning of the attack on his family. They decide to reduce the charges against Nate and give the family an escort out of town. Robyn and Shane demand to return home, but along with Kenny, Nate insists they need the trip in order to repair their relationship as a family and have family memories. The next morning, they leave the motel for the campgrounds. A police cruiser escorts them a few miles down the road before turning back and racing to another emergency. Meanwhile, the robbers spot the family Land Rover and head on after it. As they keep driving, one of the straps holding the camping gear comes loose and so the family pulls over to fix it. As Nate and Robyn unload the camping gear, he hands her the sleeping bag full of money. When she opens it, her face turns white. She tells the boys to get back into the car before lashing out at Nate. Robyn believes Nate actually stole the money from members of a laundering scheme that exposed his real-estate fraud and threw him in jail, and that they were the ones who attacked her at the motel, and insists the camping trip was nothing but a ruse for them to ""start over"". Nate is confused by her allegations and pleads with her he didn't do anything wrong. She throws the bag at Nate and drives off with the two boys, leaving him stranded. When he looks into the bag, he realizes that the money belongs to the robbers. Shane and Kenny plead their mother to turn the car around to get Nate, but they are attacked by the robbers in their Chevelle. They drive them off the road and cause them to crash into a log. Marek demands to know where the money is, and Robyn tells him her husband has it. Marek and Arielle drive off with the family while Losada and Evers remain in the Chevelle in-tow. Meanwhile, Nate walks on-foot, first down the road and then through the swamp adjacent to it. He hears a motorboat pass by and shouts for help. The driver of the boat spots Nate for a split second, but continues on and doesn't stop. Nate hides the money in a tree trunk and returns to the road. As soon as he does, the Land Rover speeds pass him. He chases after it, but is too late to stop it. Suddenly, the Chevelle appears and Losada and Evers apprehend him. They take him captive and drive off after the others. Losada informs Marek they have Nate and the two cars intersect. Marek demands Nate to hand over the money, but Nate says he'll get it once his family is let go. Marek refuses to negotiate and holds Nate at gun point to show him where the money is hidden. They return to the spot with the tree trunk, where to his horror, Nate discovers the money is missing. He doesn't tell the robbers this and returns, stating once his family is set free he'll give them the money . This angers Marek again, who says he's in charge and makes the rules, however this angers Losada who claims he should be in charge instead. Nate manipulates the two into a brawl, which allows him to run off. Arielle sees this and tells him not to do anything stupid, unknowingly allowing Robyn and the boys to escape. She drives off, but Arielle clings onto the back of the Land Rover but the boys manage to knock her out. Nate runs up to the road and Robyn slows down the car to let him get in. They speed off, but turn around after Nate tells them the next town is 40 miles away and so they're better off returning to the town with the motel. The family manages to flag down the same patrolman that arrested Nate, but he doesn't believe their wild stories of anyone chasing them. Suddenly, he's hit by the robbers and the family flees again. Marek steals the cop car and tries to gun them down. As the Chevelle and cruiser try to box the Land Rover, Nate notices gas leaking from the tank of the cruiser. Nate swerves the Land Rover into the cruiser, which ignites the fuel, causing the cruiser to spin out of control and crash into a ditch. Evers and Losada retrieve Marek and several weapons from the cruiser. Marek tells a wounded Arielle ""he won't lose to this man."" Fed up with Arielle slowing them down, Losada and Evers turn on him who insist on killing her. Marek turns the tables and holds them at gunpoint, but surprises them when he shoots Arielle in the back of the head. Meanwhile, the family tries to escape by boat but Nate uses it to distract the robbers' attention so that they can escape. Unfortunately, this backfires as the robbers take the boat to track the family down. Robyn, Kenny and Shane come across an abandoned cabin in the swamps. They find a radio inside and manage to contact someone for help, who says the police will be there in 30 minutes. Shane says that's not enough time. Nate hides in the bushes as Marek searches for the family. A snake however causes Nate to be spotted and forces him to run, however Marek shoots him down, demanding him to reveal the location of the money, and then his family. Meanwhile, Robyn, Shane and Kenny find the money and several loaded guns inside a locked up closet in the cabin, finally proving their father's innocence. Suddenly, they spot Evers and Losada outside. Robyn hides the kids in the closet and shoots Losada just as he breaks down the door. Evers retrieves him and a gunfight breaks out. When the firing stops, Shane sets fire to several portions of the money and throws them out the window, threatening to burn all of it if they don't let them go. Marek and Nate arrive. Marek threatens to execute Nate if they don't bring out the money. When Shane brings it out, Losada refuses to give him back his dad and is about to shoot him, however he is shot again and killed by Robyn. Shane flees back into the house with the money. Marek and Evers try to level the cabin by firing bullets at it. This allows Nate to grab Losada's gun and shoot Marek in the shoulder. He quickly grabs his machine gun and fires at Evers, whose last words to Nate are ""watch your back"". Nate turns around and sees Marek swing a machete at him, wounding his chest. Nate seemingly falls into the swamp as Marek takes several swings at him. Marek then enters the cabin and attacks Shane, but Robyn threatens to burn the money. Marek says she has nowhere to run, but she burns the money away. Marek knocks her out cold. Nate appears and tackles Marek, and the two engage in a brutal fight. The two of them try to choke each other, however Nate slams Marek's head into a nail on a wooden deck outside the cabin, finally killing him. Robyn, Shane and Kenny mend to him, and the four of them reconcile. In the last scene, a revving car engine is heard as well as the application of brakes. A shot of Nate's wedding ring lies covered in blood on the road  and a hand, presumably Nate's, picks it up before the screen goes black."

As Lambert is leaving, Iris's father, Senator Mabby , tries to buy the statue from him, but Lambert refuses to sell at any price.

Puzzled as to why he is there, she takes him back to his own house across the street. In the early hours of the next morning, Alex hears an ambulance outside at Robbie's house. That day, Robbie turns up at the house after Alex's mom Holly  offered to look after him for a few days, while Robbie's mother is admitted to hospital.

Baffled by his odd behavior, Ben offers to install laptops around the house to record any other strange occurrences.

She is confronted by one of these women and flees the scene. The next day Alex is home alone, and after hearing noises, follows them to the hallway, where the chandelier falls from the ceiling and smashes into the floor, almost striking her. Although her father Doug  blames the light fitters, Alex is suspicious of Robbie. The following day, Alex sees Robbie and Wyatt entering Robbie's house across the street. Alex follows them to discover that Robbie's mother Katie  is actually home, and shows no sign of illness. Wyatt tells Alex that Katie told him he was adopted, like Robbie. Alex questions her parents about Wyatt's real parents but they refuse to say anything. Later that night, Wyatt begins talking to an invisible figure, insisting that his name isn't Hunter. During this conversation a figure approaches him, but is interrupted when Doug enters the room. One night during Wyatt's bath, Holly leaves the room to answer the phone, leaving Wyatt in the tub. He is violently pulled underwater by an unseen force, where he remains for a long time. He reemerges moments later, but is unnaturally calm and sedate, thereafter referring to himself as Hunter. That night, he appears in Alex's room, where she levitates off the bed while sleeping. The next day, Holly is alone, and begins to hear strange noises. A possessed Katie enters the house undetected, and heads upstairs. When Holly enters the lounge an unseen entity suddenly picks her up and violently throws her against the walls, before dropping her on the floor. Katie returns to drag her body away. Ben later arrives to discover no one is home. He goes to view the footage in Alex's bedroom but Katie appears and snaps his neck. Alex and her father arrive, and he thinks he sees Alex's mother with Wyatt walking to Katie's house. As he goes to explore Alex goes home to discover Ben's body. She runs out of the house and over to Katie's house to warn her dad, but witnesses him being dragged violently through the house by the unseen entity. She runs to a bedroom at the far end of the house but can't find his body. As she turns around to head back out Katie appears who storms forwards, demonically screaming to Alex. Alex quickly runs and climbs out of the window where she discovers Wyatt standing outside. She pleads with him to run away with her, but he stands there, blank faced and unmoved, just as numerous blank-faced people appear in Katie's garden. Alex turns the other way only to be attacked by a screaming Katie before the camera cuts out.

After reading his book, he falls to sleep in his bed. Oswald then dreams of the live female stuffed doll  being like the title character of the story he just read: walking through the woods in a red hood and carrying a basket. He even dreams of himself in the scene, accompanying her. On the way, they met a large wolf who desperately wants a share of the goods in the doll's basket. The doll, however, declines and tells the wolf that what's inside was for her grandmother. The wolf was disgusted and thinks of a way to obtain the contents. As Oswald and the doll go on walking, the wolf decided to reach the grandmother's home before them which is part of his plan. The wolf invades the house and harasses the old lady before putting her in a freezer. He then disguises himself in a nightgown and tucks himself in the bed. When the two little friends finally arrived at the house, the doll proceeds to the bedroom while Oswald stays near door. While the rabbit waits, a rat came to and tells him to open the freezer. Oswald opens it and was shocked to find the real grandmother trapped in a block of ice. At the bedroom, the doll eventually realizes who she's speaking to and begins to make her run as the wolf aggressively goes forth. In no time, the wolf got his hands on the doll and takes her basket which he finds a magic wand inside. Before Oswald could intervene, he magically sends the rabbit into a skyscraper area, dangling on two clotheslines. The wolf then teleports Oswald onto an elevated railway with an incoming train, then into the mouth of a whale, and finally in a shooting gallery with firing shooters. He and the doll  were in every place Oswald was transported to, but at safer locations. Finding his way out of the shooters' gunfire, Oswald was able to take the wand, and teleports everybody back to the grandmother's place. When they returned to the house, the wolf, for some reason, was lying on a table unconscious. Oswald then uses the wand to transform their tormentor into a large roasted turkey. The grandmother, who is finally defrosted, came to the dining room and decides to have a meal of what's on the table. For a job well done, Oswald and the doll kissed each other. Morning came and Oswald wakes up from his dream. He was, however, surprised to see that what he had been kissing was a cow which sticks its head in the window.

His mother Sarah Connor  had been preparing him throughout his childhood for his future role as the leader of the human Resistance against Skynet, but was arrested after attempting to bomb a computer factory and remanded to a hospital for the criminally insane under the supervision of Dr. Silberman . Skynet sends a new Terminator, a T-1000 , back in time to kill John. A prototype which is more advanced than the Terminator sent after Sarah, the T-1000 is composed of a ""mimetic poly-alloy"", a liquid metal that allows it to take the shape and appearance of anyone or anything it touches. Though it cannot mimic complex machines such as guns or bombs, it can shape parts of itself into knives and stabbing weapons and can mimic the voice and appearance of humans. It assumes the identity of a police officer and goes in pursuit of John. Meanwhile, the future John Connor has sent back a reprogrammed T-800 Terminator  to protect his younger self. The Terminator and the T-1000 converge on John in a shopping mall, and a chase ensues in which John and the Terminator escape by motorcycle. Fearing that the T-1000 will kill Sarah in order to get to him, John orders the Terminator to help free her. They encounter Sarah in the midst of her own escape attempt. She is initially terrified by the Terminator but accepts its assistance after it helps them to escape the T-1000. The Terminator informs John and Sarah about Skynet, the artificial intelligence that will initiate a nuclear war on ""Judgment Day"" and go on to create the machines that will hunt the remnants of humanity.In The Terminator, Sarah is only informed by Kyle Reese that Skynet would become self-aware and initiate a nuclear war; in Terminator 2, the T-800 discloses the date of such an event to be August 29, 1997. Sarah learns that the man most directly responsible for Skynet's creation is Miles Dyson , a Cyberdyne Systems engineer working on a revolutionary new microprocessor that will form the basis for Skynet. Sarah gathers weapons from an old friend and plans to flee with John to Mexico, but after having a horrific nightmare of a nuclear explosion she awakens and sets out to kill Miles Dyson to prevent ""Judgment Day"" from occurring. She wounds him at his home but finds herself unable to kill him in front of his family. John and the Terminator arrive and inform Miles of the consequences of his work and learn that much of his research has been reverse engineered from the CPU and arm of the previous Terminator sent after Sarah. Convincing him that these items and his designs must be destroyed, they break into the Cyberdyne building and retrieve the CPU and arm. The police and the T-1000 arrive and Miles is mortally shot and stays behind to trigger a detonator that will destroy his research. The T-1000 pursues John, Sarah, and the Terminator, catching up to them in a steel mill. In a climactic battle, the Terminator fires a grenade into the T-1000 and it falls into a vat of molten steel, where it is destroyed. John throws the components of the original Terminator into the vat as well. The Terminator then sacrifices itself, asking Sarah to lower it into the steel so that its technology cannot be used to create Skynet. Sarah looks to the future with hope, believing that if a machine can learn the value of human life, humanity may not be doomed to self-destruction."

All of a sudden, a large oppressive pit bull pulls it right under their feet, much to their surprise. The pit bull pretends to apologize in giving Oswald a handshake but snaps a rat trap at the rabbit's hand instead. When the large dog flirts with the girl beagle, the annoyed Oswald quickly takes her and walks out of the scene. Oswald and his date went to a refreshment stand to order ice cream sodas. Upon receiving their beverages, the pit bull shows up again, takes Oswald's drink, and consumes it. The girl beagle didn't drink hers but instead pours the stuff in the pit bull's hat without the latter noticing. As the big dog puts on the hat and gets covered in a creamy mess, the two little tourists immediately moved to another location. After spending a few moments at the punch pad game, Oswald and the girl beagle decide to have a ride. They then selected a bizarre one operated by a marsupial. The girl beagle was first to go as the marsupial launches her high in the air where she lands and slides onto a series of animals. In the end, however, she was nabbed by the pit bull. Oswald comes to her assistance by picking up a bow and shooting arrows at the pit bull's back. In this, the large dog drops the girl beagle and sets sights on the rabbit. Running from the pit bull, Oswald climbs and crawls through a small hole in the fence. The large dog attempts to get through too, only to get stucked half-way. The rabbit then draws a picture of a rat on the pit bull's rear, attracting a stray cat and then a hound. Both of which went in a mauling fashion. Eventually, the pit bull was able to get out of the situation and continues pursuing Oswald. Oswald, still on the run, enters a gate to the backyard of a house. Instead of going in also, the pit bull peeks through one of the windows. While his pursuer is still looking in, Oswald appears in front of the house from a distance and throws a stick at the other window, breaking the glass. The disturbed homeowner then opens the door in the blink of an eye, therefore smashing the pit bull between it and the front wall. Oswald comes to and writes a ""welcome"" message on the flattened dog before placing the latter in front of the door. The girl beagle then shows up in the vicinity, happily calling Oswald.

Somehow he manages to get the job of a Malayalam teacher at a tuition centre. His wife Geetha works in a consumer store. The couple stays in a rented house owned by Kariyachan. Bharathan is a genius inventor and has a rather inquisitive mind especially as far as scientific matters are concerned. He is always around inventions with little care on what happens around him. He never sticks to any particular job, which lands his family in deep financial troubles. His wife Geetha is upset about all this, but little could she do to avoid her husband from becoming the laughing stock of many who don't understand him. Some people like Kariachan  cleverly usurp the patent rights of some of Bharathan's crude inventions. The few people who come with helping hands are Thankachan, one of his students in the tuition centre and Peter, who goes around finding him new jobs. In the meantime Bharathan invents a gadget that could be used to clean and sweep the courtyard and also to pluck coconuts and fruits from palms and trees. One day, on the way to take classes, Bharathan notices a paper rocket-flown by some children-staying midair for an unusually long period of time. This and a few other experiences lead him to a very spectacular discovery relating to gravity. But people around him brand him a lunatic and that leads to many problems in his life. But Bharathan does discover the reason behind the phenomenon is antigravity and claims that he can make flying objects that can be used by man to reach any destination without any fuel, and he suddenly gets famous. But due to over concentration, Bharathan loses his memory about the project. The government brings a psychiatrist to cure him. He finds that with some seemingly fatal interventions, Bharathan could be cured and he could make anti gravity to a workable.

He gets to his office and arrives to a harrowing scene; his co-workers are shredding documents and are in a state of chaos. He sees his boss, who informs him that his company is a Ponzi scheme run by the mob. He is being accused of spearheading the scheme and laundering funds and has to enter his family into a witness protection program. The program relocates them to a refuge where no one will think to look for them: Madea and Joe's house in Georgia. Meanwhile, Jake - whose ailing father is a church pastor who has put him in charge of the church's mortgage fund - stages a robbery . Jake, who has a criminal past but whose father trusts that he has turned over a new leaf, is trying to recover church funds that he has invested in Needleman's company without his father's knowledge or consent, only to lose the entire investment in the Ponzi scheme. The Needlemans' first meeting with Madea and Joe is awkward and bodes poorly for how everyone will get along. However, over time, Madea helps Kate and Cindy relate better to each other and to other family members, while Joe and Kate help George become more confident, more in touch with his surroundings and people around him, and more effective in channeling his emotions. Barbara displays dual sensibilities about ""colored people"". On one hand, she mistakes Madea for a domestic named Sadie, treats ""Sadie"" imperiously, and threatens to get her fired. On the other hand, she recognizes Joe as a man she slept with years ago , and relates to him seductively; she also enjoys Negro spirituals and repeatedly asks to be taken to the African American church down the street from Madea's house. Pastor Nelson's sermon inspires George to recognize a pattern in his company's records that explains where 10% of the stolen funds have been stashed. After church, watching Whoopi Goldberg's Oda Mae Brown character in Ghost inspires George to involve Madea in a plan to redivert funds from the ""stashed"" accounts back to the charities whose investments were stolen in the Ponzi scheme. The plan requires George , Jake, and Madea  to travel to New York City, and for ""Precious"" to meet with a bank manager to transfer funds from the laundered accounts to the legitimate charities. Madea successfully accomplishes her mission, although she improvises both an expansion of her assumed identity  and of the accounts to which ""Precious's"" funds are transferred by having some money sent to her real bank account, unbeknownst to George and Jake. When George and Jake begin to share their plan with Brian , he cuts them off and advises them it is illegal. However, after they pull off the caper, Brian informs George that his cooperation with the authorities and his successful efforts to return the charities' funds have given Brian leverage to sentence George to probation and waive a trial and jail time. Kate points out to George that the situation has strengthened their relationship and their family, and that it is a blessing in disguise. Upon leaving Madea's house, Cindy and Howie ask if they can come back to visit but both Madea and Joe immediately decline . Before returning to New York, the Needlemans visit Pastor Nelson's church one last time. The Pastor and Jake burn the mortgage papers and the entire congregation celebrates the mortgage's being paid off, and the Needlemans enjoy the Negro spirituals. Madea also enjoys the spiritual music from her front porch, celebrating her new wealth."

As he goes on his journey, he spots a bird above, suspending something under its beak. The curious Krazy turned his vehicle into an aircraft, and takes off to investigate. Coming close in his flying car, he was amazed that the bird he spotted was a stork carrying an infant. He then sees the stork handing the child to a person on a rooftop before leaving. Although the bird leaves with an empty beak, Krazy continues to follow it. The feline follows the stork into an adoption center up on the clouds. Inside, he was intrigued to see orphaned infants groomed and taken out of the place by other storks for delivery. Lunch time came just then and one of the birds calls Krazy to watch over the infants. The infants are loud and bothersome but Krazy was able to keep them company. Suddenly, he receives a customer's order by phone. The cat then selected the suitable child for the delivery and takes off. Up in mid-air for a few moments, Krazy was carrying the infant smoothly. But things became quite difficult for him as the tyke starts playing mischievously. Nevertheless, they reached the customer's house on time. When the infant's diaper came off, the feline tries to put it back. The infant, however, refuses to wear it, and Krazy tries to do things in a scuffle, only to put the diaper on himself. The child then disappears mysteriously, and Krazy looks into the chimney. While he does, the infant shows up from the edge of the roof, and pushes him into the flue. Krazy falls through the chimney and into the house with a waiting couple inside. Because of the diaper he's wearing, the couple mistook him as the infant they ordered. The overjoyed wife then picks up, hugs, and smooches Krazy, much to the feline's dismay. After getting too much of the unwanted affection, Krazy removes his diaper and convinces the couple that there's a misunderstanding. Immediately, the infant he tried to deliver finally comes down the chimney and has been diapered somehow. The couple were even more please, knowing they got the correct order.

They capture Casper, like Lilliputians did to Gulliver, then place him in a cage on wheels, in which they tow him to the Ruler of the Moon, King Luna. The King addresses Casper as a monster, and treats him as an enemy. Casper playfully picks up King Luna, and the king has him placed in the royal dungeon. A dejected Casper is imprisoned. Then animated trees attack the city of the moon men. The moon men defend their fortified city with flaming missiles. The tree monsters fight back with water, then break through the town walls. When the fight seems lost to the tree monsters, Casper escapes his cage, and helps the moon men. Casper goes underground. The friendly ghost then pulls trees' parts through the moon surface and ties them together, immobilizing the trees. The frustrated trees writhe and strain against the knots Casper has tied. Casper and the moon men have won. Then, and only then, does King Luna embrace Casper as a friend. King Luna knights Casper for the valiant defense of his people.

Barney tricks the sea lion into swimming the other way by pretending to throw the anchor in one direction, then throws in another. He goes with it because his foot was tied to the rope, but the sea lion saves him. A fish is stuck in Barney's suit, in which the sea lion, in an attempt to catch the fish with a trident, pokes Barney's backside. The fish gets out of Barney's suit, lands back in the water and the sea lion aides Barney in catching it. After chasing it into a cave, the sea lion unsuccessfully warns Barney of an oncoming shark, and flees. The shark pulls up behind him and bumps Barney's bottom, which Barney thinks is more of the sea lion's goading; he turns around and angers the shark by poking him with the trident. Barney tries evading the shark by pretending to be an underwater king, which fails. Barney tries hiding under a rock, which is soon revealed to be an octopus that swims away in fear, and the shark tries eating Barney. The sea lion tries to stop it, by keeping the jaws open, to which the shark's teeth nibbles Barney in the rear. Barney and the sea lion get back to the boat with the shark in pursuit. The shark uses its fin to saw the boat in half and Barney tries reconnecting it. Using its tail as a propeller, the shark strikes the boat. Just before the shark finally eats Barney, the anchor bangs the shark on the head and Barney and the Sea Lion use the shark to ride back to land.

She then lays it by the door of a wax museum owned by Oswald. The woman knocks on the door and leaves. Oswald opens up and saw what's in front of him. In doubt that he would make a good caretaker, however, the rabbit was reluctant to take the child in, and therefore goes back inside. But before the door closes, the baby, who is a boy, climbs out of the basket and enters the place. To his surprise, Oswald found the baby boy indoors. He then goes on walking around, wondering what he should do. But when the child cling onto his leg and asks to be accepted, Oswald changed his mind. As it was late that night, Oswald went to sleep, sharing his bed with his new little brother figure. The baby boy, however, isn't sleepy and decides to have a little tour of the museum. While wondering the museum's hallways, the baby boy finds part of his pyjamas opened. He then asks some statues to close it for him. After one of them provides assistance, that statue decides to show the little sightseer around. Thus all the other wax characters in the area came to life and went into a celebration by singing and dancing. It was a beautiful experience. The baby boy walks further in the museum and into another section. Unlike the ones he met previously, however, the statues there are hideous and hostile. They want nothing more than to torment anyone who steps into their abode. To defend himself, the baby boy grabs a blow torch, liquifying some of the wax monsters. Despite the child's advantage, the wax monsters were able to get close enough and take his weapon away. They then forced their victim onto a platform and began to pour molten wax on him. Back in the bedroom, Oswald hears the baby boy's cries for help, and makes the run. But by the time the rabbit reached the location, it was too late, and all that's left on the platform is a wax relic in the shape of an infant. Oswald was then caught by the wax monsters to suffer a similar fate. It turns out all that trouble was in Oswald's dream.

She then lays it by the door of a wax museum owned by Oswald. The woman knocks on the door and leaves. Oswald opens up and saw what's in front of him. In doubt that he would make a good caretaker, however, the rabbit was reluctant to take the child in, and therefore goes back inside. But before the door closes, the baby, who is a boy, climbs out of the basket and enters the place. To his surprise, Oswald found the baby boy indoors. He then goes on walking around, wondering what he should do. But when the child cling onto his leg and asks to be accepted, Oswald changed his mind. As it was late that night, Oswald went to sleep, sharing his bed with his new little brother figure. The baby boy, however, isn't sleepy and decides to have a little tour of the museum. While wondering the museum's hallways, the baby boy finds part of his pyjamas opened. He then asks some statues to close it for him. After one of them provides assistance, that statue decides to show the little sightseer around. Thus all the other wax characters in the area came to life and went into a celebration by singing and dancing. It was a beautiful experience. The baby boy walks further in the museum and into another section. Unlike the ones he met previously, however, the statues there are hideous and hostile. They want nothing more than to torment anyone who steps into their abode. To defend himself, the baby boy grabs a blow torch, liquifying some of the wax monsters. Despite the child's advantage, the wax monsters were able to get close enough and take his weapon away. They then forced their victim onto a platform and began to pour molten wax on him. Back in the bedroom, Oswald hears the baby boy's cries for help, and makes the run. But by the time the rabbit reached the location, it was too late, and all that's left on the platform is a wax relic in the shape of an infant. Oswald was then caught by the wax monsters to suffer a similar fate. It turns out all that trouble was in Oswald's dream. Finally waking up in his bed, Oswald was relieved to see the baby boy completely unscathed. He was then asked by the child to button the rear part of the latter's jammies.

Then the story goes back 6 months. Izna is hired by an intelligence officer Aayan Thakur  and Security Chief Guru Saldanah  to become a 'Honey-trap' and help them retrieve critical information from a dreaded assassin Kabir . During this mission Aayan gets to know about Izna's previous relationships with Kabir when Kabir, himself used to work for the intelligence. Kabir was discovered by Izna during one of his missions where Izna was being used for drug-peddling in a pub, which she was unaware of. Kabir makes an entry in the pub, shoots and arrests the guilty drug-peddlers. He calls Izna who explains that she was innocent and doesn't knew about the goon's intentions, Kabir takes a coin from her and decides not to arrest her and Izna was allowed to leave. Izna started loving Kabir and followed him to his house and handed him a love letter written with her own blood. Both start loving each other but one day Kabir disappears without any word. Six years pass by and Izna did not find him despite of many tries. After Izna agreed to do the mission, she was taken to a residential colony in Sri Lanka, to live where Kabir also lived with an identity of a musician. Izna was asked to act as Aayan's fiancee and was given a story of how they both met each other. Izna was asked to go to Kabir's house to introduce herself as his new neighbor however he shut the door on her face as if he does not recognize her. The very next day he came to her window and wrote ""Sorry"" on the glass with his blood but ran away as soon as a phonecall came. Kabir attacks Guru Saldanah's team but Saldanah, however, makes an escape and plans to stop the operation. Meanwhile, Aayan plans to steal the data from Kabir while Izna takes Kabir out of his house. Izna sends a letter to Kabir telling him that she wants to meet him, following which Kabir leaves his house. Aayan takes charge and moves to Kabir's house to steal the data however upon copying data from his laptop gives Kabir an alert to his phone seeing which he runs towards his house. Aayan escapes with the data through the window but later, he discovers that the data was fake. Izna disagrees to stop the operation and says that she will never forgive Kabir and will soon bring him down and thus, requests to continue the operation. Kabir still trusted Izna and never had a suspicion on her but his trusted friend and right hand Sumit suspects her and warns Kabir about her. Kabir proposes to marry her and asks Izna to shift to his house and leave Aayan. Izna agrees to this but in the meantime Aayan starts to love Izna and gets angry upon hearing this and tries to stop her, but she claims that she will only be able to steal the data once she gets into Kabir's house. Next day she moves to his house and starts staying with Kabir. In the meanwhile Kabir asked Sumit to arrange for a priest for the marriage, who accidentally read an SMS to Aayan on Izna's phone which proved she was a spy. Sumit goes to kill Aayan but was killed in a gun battle. Aayan calls Izna for some urgent talk and expresses his fears that they can no longer play this risky game as when Kabir will find out that Sumit is killed, he will kill Izna. Aayan gives her poison and asks her to mix it in the drink of Kabir. Meanwhile when Izna was not at home, Kabir goes to Aayan's house and discovers Sumit's Bluetooth on the verandah. To find more about Sumit, Kabir searches the house and ends up discovering a book inside Izna's bag which had pages marked on them and had a similar story that Izna told to Kabir regarding her meeting Aayan. This confirms Sumit's suspicion and Kabir waits for Izna. Izna returns and offers him coffee. Izna mixes poison in the coffee given by Aayan. Kabir tells Izna that years back, he left Izna for a sting operation but during the operation, he had discovered that the country's own officers, security forces and politicians were corrupt. Therefore, he had shortlisted them and then he had them killed. According to Kabir, he was a patriot and not a terrorist. Kabir threw away the poisoned coffee and told Izna that the Guru Saldanah and his team is a fraud who would kill Izna as soon as they would get the hard disk containing the original data. He asks Izna to escape and offers her a new passport, tickets and a Swiss bank account from where she can withdraw unlimited money. Yet, Izna refuses and when Kabir hugs Izna and kisses her before their separation, Izna shoots him in his stomach. Kabir dies immediately and Izna runs away with the hard disk containing the original data. She goes to Guru Saldanah and hands over the hard disk to him. However, she is soon surprised to know that Guru Saldanah was a fraud and after the task she was supposed to be killed and Aayan was given this responsibility to kill her; later, Aayan changed his mind as he was in love with her, hearing that Saldanah tried to kill Izna but Aayan killed him instead. Izna told Aayan that because of their fraud mission she killed an innocent person, that too, the love of her life who blindly trusted her. Izna says that she would prefer to die with Kabir rather than living with Aayan and attempts to leave with the hard disk. Aayan threatens to shoot Izna if she leaves the house, but still she leaves and then she is shot by Aayan from the back. Izna falls to the ground but when Aayan comes to check whether she died or not, Izna shoots him to death. Then finally Izna, herself, dies. After dying, Izna's soul asks forgiveness from Kabir's soul who at once, forgives her. Izna tells Kabir that without him, heaven won't be heaven for her and with him, she won't be afraid to go to hell. Then their souls rests in peace."

After a boring evening of watching television, including the reality show series, Tuff Gurlz, where a foul-mouthed woman  throws a used tampon at another for defecating in her food, and an episode of American Superstarz where a singer named Steven Clark  is cruelly humiliated by the judges for his horrible singing voice, Frank contemplates killing his rude and inconsiderate neighbors, whose screaming baby mixed in with his own insomnia and chronic migraine headaches give him a lack of peace in his own home. His ex-wife, Alison  has custody of their daughter, Ava , who has become a spoiled brat whose mother caters to her every whim. Making matters worse, he has just been fired from his job at an insurance company, after a failed attempt at being nice results in a sexual harassment complaint and violation of company privacy for looking up her address in the records. He is then informed by his uninterested doctor he has a terminal brain tumor that is nearly inoperable, but the doctor's seeming lack of concern only drives Frank further into depression. Frank tries to commit suicide with a pistol he owns, but stops when he watches a reality show starring Chloe , a spoiled teenager, who launches into a profanity-laced tirade when her parents mistakenly buy her a Lexus sedan instead of a Cadillac Escalade for her birthday, and has an epiphany. The next day he steals his neighbor's Camaro, drives to Chloe's school in Virginia and handcuffs her to her own steering wheel at gunpoint. After a failed attempt to ignite her gas tank, he kills her by shooting her at point blank range. One of Chloe's classmates, Roxanne ""Roxy"" Harmon , witnesses this and comes to the same realization as Frank that people have become stupid and need to die. Roxy follows Frank back to his motel where he is once again preparing to commit suicide, however she prevents this by convincing Frank that the media would inevitably paint him as a homicidal stalker who only killed Chloe because of an unrequited sexual obsession. Frank explains to Roxy that he only wants bad people to die, people who have committed blatant acts of cruelty and stupidity against their fellow man. To alleviate Frank's thoughts of suicide, Roxy suggests they kill Chloe's parents and he agrees. Frank shoots Chloe's father ([[Larry Miller  and after a brief chase, Roxy stabs her mother  with a kitchen knife. Roxy convinces Frank to take her along to keep her away from her drug addict mother and abusive rapist step-father. They then decide to go on the lam to continue their killing spree. After buying new clothes at a thrift store, they visit a movie theater to watch a documentary about the 1968 My Lai Massacre. During the movie, several rude teenagers enter the mostly empty theater and begin talking loudly and using their cell phones. Frank and Roxy shoot and kill all but one of them, as well as another patron  who refrains himself from picking up somebody with the reason that he's working and tries to film the shooting with his cellphone. Afterwards they kill several others, including a man who double-parks his car, zealous religious protestors who step on the rights of homosexuals and other religious and personal freedoms that America should stand for, and Michael Fuller , a popular but abrasive conservative political television commentator. After hearing about Steven Clark's attempt to kill himself apparently due to his infamy on American Superstarz garnering him a huge cult following and reappearance on Superstarz, Frank contemplates taking over the show. Frank then receives a call from his doctor telling him that there was an earlier mix-up with Frank's MRI results, and that his migraines are probably the result of simple stress and hypertension, rather than cancer. Elated that he's not dying, Frank decides to move to France with Roxy to avoid prosecution for the murders they've committed. While eating in a diner with Roxy, Frank is propositioned by a pervert who mistakes Roxy for an underage prostitute and Frank as her pimp. Frank tells the pervert he has the wrong idea and leaves the diner. Later, Frank discovers in a news report that Roxy's real family and life are far different than she described; a typical American mother and father  in an upper-middle-class neighborhood looking for her on television. Roxy confesses that she lied to Frank about her life back home. Her parents are really normal people who do care about her, but have always failed to take the time out of their material, consumer lives to appreciate her as a person. Frank then strangles the pervert who had accosted him earlier in the diner, and takes his truck. Angry that she lied to him, Frank parts ways with Roxy, giving her the Camaro he had stolen from his neighbor. Meanwhile, Roxy returns back home to her family. Frank buys an AK-47 assault weapon from an illegal arms dealer , and makes his way to the American Superstarz studio, killing off several cast members and holding the judges and contestants hostage for humiliating Steven. But after making a brutally honest speech in front of the camera about the ridiculousness and selfishness that is promoted in today's American society and on TV, Steven reveals that the real reason he attempted suicide wasn't out of humiliation, but because he'd never be on TV again. When the SWAT team arrives, Roxy joins Frank on stage surprisingly from the audience, and they proceed to shoot Steven, all the judges, contestants and the audience before they are gunned down by the police, falling very much like their symbolic Bonnie and Clyde."

Her mother is hospitalized because of an incurable disease. Therefore, Akari longs for a dog who can keep her company. One day, a Golden Retriever puppy unexpectedly appears in the garden of Akari's house, and Akari immediately decides to adopt it. At her mother's suggestion, Akari christens it ""Socks"", because the puppy's white paws made it look like it was wearing white socks. Her mother also made Akari promise that she will follow the The Ten Commandments of Dog Ownership when she takes care of Socks. Akari also has a friend, Susumu, who is groomed by his family to become a professional guitarist. Susumu soon forms an attachment with Socks as well. A few months later, Akari's mother died, and Akari grieves over her death for two days. After that, her neck became very stiff and she is unable to move it. With Socks help, she discovers that this stiffness is actually due to her own imagination, and is thus ""cured"". She also finds out that Socks was actually placed in the garden by her mother. Not long after Akari's mother died, the family moves to Sapporo because her father was given a lecturer post at a university there. However, they cannot bring Socks along because their dormitory does not allow pets. Hence, Akari has to reluctantly entrust Socks to the care of Susumu. Another problem surfaced when Susumu was accepted into a prestigious music school in Paris. On the day that he was leaving, Akari's father, who was supposed to be on leave that day, was suddenly called back to the hospital to do an ""emergency"" operation. This caused Akari to be late in seeing Susumu off. The ""emergency"" operation turned out to be a minor one, and he resigned after feeling guilty about disappointing his daughter. The family later moved back to their old home in Hakodate, and Socks came back to stay with them. Akari's father later set up a clinic in the home, which proved to be popular with the locals. 10 years later, Akari is a university student studying to become a vet. By chance, she happens to see a poster advertising Susumu's upcoming performance in the city. The pair had a tearful reunion, and they soon started dating. During this time, she starts to feel that Socks is a constrain to her. She starts to bemoan the sacrifices that she have to make because of Socks. After Akari graduates from university, she becomes a zookeeper at Asahiyama Zoo. Akari seldom returns to her home, and neglects Socks in the process. However, she was reminded of the good friend Socks was again when it helped Susumu gain confidence to play the guitar again after his accident. As time passes, Socks starts to age and becomes weaker. Akari was shocked at how much weaker Socks looked on one of her rare visits home, and promises to visit it often. However, due to her heavy workload, she is unable to fulfill that promise. One day, her father phoned her urgently to say that Socks was dying. Managing to get away from her work, she rushes back just in time. As its energy saps away, Akari read the Ten Commandments of Dog Ownership again to see if she had done what she had promised 10 years ago. After Socks's death, Akari and her father found long-lost photographs of Socks, and a letter from her mother. The letter tells Akari that Socks was meant to replace herself, though she added that Socks will not live as long as Akari. Akari was also reminded of the fact that her father sacrificed his career for her. Not long after, Akari and Susumu got married together."

He meets an armadillo named Roadkill  who is seeking the mystical Spirit of the West and directs the parched chameleon to find water at a town called Dirt. While wandering the desert, he narrowly avoids being eaten by a red-tailed hawk and has a surreal nightmare before meeting the desert iguana Beans , a rancher's daughter, who takes the chameleon to Dirt, an Old West town populated by desert animals. Using bravado and improvisation to fit in, the chameleon presents himself to the townsfolk as a tough drifter named Rango. He quickly runs afoul of outlaw Gila monster Bad Bill , but avoids a shootout when Bill is scared off by the hawk's return. Rango is chased by the hawk until he accidentally knocks down an empty water tower which crushes the predator. In response, the town mayor  appoints Rango the new sheriff. Meanwhile, the townsfolk worry that with the hawk dead, the gunslinger Rattlesnake Jake  will return. After discovering Dirt's water reserves — stored in the town bank inside a water cooler bottle — to be near empty, a skeptical Beans demands Rango investigate. That night, however, Rango inadvertently assists a trio of bank robbers, led by a mole named Balthazar , mistaking them for prospectors. The townsfolk find their water bottle stolen the next day, so Rango organizes a posse. They discover bank manager Merrimack  dead in the desert from drowning, and track the robbers to their hideout. They fight the robbers' clan over the stolen water bottle in a chase through a canyon before discovering the bottle to be empty. Despite the robbers professing they had found it empty, the posse brings them to town for trial. Rango confronts the mayor about his buying of land around Dirt, who denies any wrongdoing and shows Rango that he is building a modern city with the purchased land. The mayor summons Rattlesnake Jake, who runs Rango out of town after humiliating him and making him admit that everything he told the town about himself is a lie. Rango wanders away ashamed and confused about his identity. Then he meets the Spirit of the West , appearing as a cowboy who drives a golf cart, and whom Rango identifies as the Man with No Name. The Spirit inspires Rango, telling him, ""No man can walk out on his own story."" With the aid of Roadkill and mystical moving yuccas, Rango learns that Dirt's water supply is controlled by an emergency shut-off valve in a water pipeline to Las Vegas, which the mayor has been manipulating. Recruiting the robbers' clan to aid him, Rango returns to Dirt to call out Jake for a duel with a single bullet, a diversion so the clan and yuccas can turn the pipeline's valve to flood the town with water and free the falsely accused robbers. The mayor, however, forces Rango to surrender by threatening Beans' life, and locks them inside the glass bank vault to drown. He then tries to shoot Jake with Rango's gun, believing that Jake is still part of the Old West that the mayor wants to destroy along with the rest of the town. The mayor is shocked to discover it that the gun is empty; Rango has taken the bullet, which he uses to crack the glass and shatter the vault, freeing himself and Beans while washing the Mayor and his men away outside. Impressed, Jake tips his hat to Rango as thanks for saving his life and drags the mayor into the desert to take revenge for double-crossing him. The citizens of Dirt celebrate the return of the water and recognize Rango as their hero."

Nico is always followed by a black cat. The following morning, the cat wakes in a house with a little girl, catches a lizard and gives it to the girl. Zoé, hearing Jeanne, her mother, calls her to come in and look at her lizards, but Jeanne is too busy on the phone to take much notice of what she is shown. At nightfall, the cat leaves and goes to find Nico. On the way the cat walks on walls and teases a dog that barks incessantly causing its owner to throw a shoe at it. Nico gives the cat a bracelet in the shape of fish, which it gives to Zoé. Her mother sees the bracelet and asks Zoé to give it to her. Before leaving, Zoé sees a picture in her mother's dossier file of a man Victor Costa. Jeanne takes the bracelet and gives it to Lucas, a colleague of hers at the police station who asks her to see if it matches up to any of the items stolen at one the most recent burglaries in the Rue Mouffetard. Jeanne is commissioned to handle the security of a huge African statue that has been the target of M. Costa and that cost her husband his life. The statue is being moved soon and will be the last opportunity for Costa to get his hands on it. Victor Costa has been indeed planning how to steal the statue with his minions, M. Bébé , M. Hulot, M. Grenouille , M. Patate . When the bracelet does indeed turn up, Lucas follows the lead up to Nico's. Claudine has been watching Zoé, but fails to notice that she has followed the cat. While following the cat Zoé discovers that Claudine is actually a member of his gang and has been working as a sitter to have a deep insight into what the police are planning. The thieves discover Zoé who hides in Nico’s house, M. Costa nearly discovers Zoé but at the last minute one of his minions calls for him down to the cellar, they have discovered Nico’s cache. Zoé tries to leave but she is caught by Claudine but at the last minute Nico comes back, who locks the mobsters in the cellar. Nico escapes with Zoé on his back jumping over the roof tops with M. Costa and his gang in pursuit after they broke the door down. Nico leaves Zoé near the zoo, she must follow the cat back to his place while he distracts the thieves. The gang is close by and they all follow Nico but M. Costa discovers a piece of Zoé’s t-shirt in the bushes and orders M. Grenouille to follow him after the child in the zoo where they come close to catching her but she escapes in a boat and due to the fact that neither M. Costa nor M. Grenouille can swim. Lucas has been following the cat lead and a neighbor tells him that the cat always comes out of a neighboring house and goes to another, annoying everyone because of the dog. Lucas calls Jeanne to come to her own house because it is related to the burglaries. After she arrives they head up to Nico’s to wait. After shaking the rest of the gang, Nico goes back to his place and finds Zoé there, as he is about to enter the house he is arrested by Jeanne and Lucas, Claudine tells Jeanne that Nico kidnapped Zoé. Jeanne and Lucas take Nico in their police car and while driving to the station, Nico tells Jeanne that she made a mistake and that Zoé is in great danger, he gets the cat to attack Lucas who is driving and uses the opportunity to grab Jeanne’s gun and take over the situation, after stopping he tells Jeanne that he is going to stop Costa and save Zoé. Jeanne becomes suspicious and orders Lucas to take her home. As they arrive they see that indeed Zoé and Claudine are not there. Claudine has taken Zoé to M. Costa’s house and they have her locked in one of the rooms while drinking champagne. Claudine applies more of her usual perfume that makes everyone else sick, they open the window and the scent reaches Nico and the cat, who always sneezes at Claudine’s smell and it leads Nico to Zoé. After cutting the power down he puts on his usual night goggles and sneaks into the house and whisks Zoé away right under the nose of M. Patate who is sulking because he is stuck with the child and not drinking champagne with the rest of the gang. At the last moment Nico’s presence is discovered and once again he escapes with Zoé over the roof tops with M. Costa in pursuit. The chase takes them up to Notre Dame de Paris, Nico leaves Zoé in one of the terraces and teases Costa to go after him, they both fall because the gargoyles cannot take their weight but Costa is saved because he grabs another gargoyle while Nico is saved by Jeanne. Costa manages to trap Zoé again and jumps over to a nearby crane followed by Jeanne, Nico and the cat. Costa manages to push the cat over the edge and Nico jumps to save it, leaving Jeanne to confront Costa by herself; Jeanne has been having waking nightmares about Costa but she rises above them and uses her personal defense training to free Zoé and disorient Costa who falls from the crane. Jeanne tries to save Costa with the help of Nico, by grabbing him by his shirt; Costa has banged his head against the crane very hard and becomes mad and has a hallucination that the statue has come to rescue him so he jumps off the crane’s hook into the hands of the statue, falling to his death. The rest of the gang, including Claudine, are arrested and Zoé has now started talking again. The next winter, the cat goes over to Nico’s but is let in by Jeanne, from the window it can be seen that Jeanne, Zoé and Nico are a new family. Nico gives a gift to Jeanne, a snow globe with Notre Dame in it.

At the last moment Nico’s presence is discovered and once again he escapes with Zoé over the roof tops with M. Costa in pursuit. The chase takes them up to Notre Dame de Paris, Nico leaves Zoé in one of the terraces and teases Costa to go after him, they both fall because the gargoyles cannot take their weight but Costa is saved because he grabs another gargoyle while Nico is saved by Jeanne. Costa manages to trap Zoé again and jumps over to a nearby crane followed by Jeanne, Nico and the cat. Costa manages to push the cat over the edge and Nico jumps to save it, leaving Jeanne to confront Costa by herself; Jeanne has been having waking nightmares about Costa but she rises above them and uses her personal defense training to free Zoé and disorient Costa who falls from the crane. Jeanne tries to save Costa with the help of Nico, by grabbing him by his shirt; Costa has banged his head against the crane very hard and becomes mad and has a hallucination that the statue has come to rescue him so he jumps off the crane’s hook into the hands of the statue, falling to his death. The rest of the gang, including Claudine, are arrested and Zoé has now started talking again. The next winter, the cat goes over to Nico’s but is let in by Jeanne, from the window it can be seen that Jeanne, Zoé and Nico are a new family. Nico gives a gift to Jeanne, a snow globe with Notre Dame in it.

Zoé, hearing Jeanne, her mother, calls her to come in and look at her lizards, but Jeanne is too busy on the phone to take much notice of what she is shown. At nightfall, the cat leaves and goes to find Nico. On the way the cat walks on walls and teases a dog that barks incessantly causing its owner to throw a shoe at it. Nico gives the cat a bracelet in the shape of fish, which it gives to Zoé. Her mother sees the bracelet and asks Zoé to give it to her. Before leaving, Zoé sees a picture in her mother's dossier file of a man Victor Costa. Jeanne takes the bracelet and gives it to Lucas, a colleague of hers at the police station who asks her to see if it matches up to any of the items stolen at one the most recent burglaries in the Rue Mouffetard. Jeanne is commissioned to handle the security of a huge African statue that has been the target of M. Costa and that cost her husband his life. The statue is being moved soon and will be the last opportunity for Costa to get his hands on it. Victor Costa has been indeed planning how to steal the statue with his minions, M. Bébé , M.

Grenouille to follow him after the child in the zoo where they come close to catching her but she escapes in a boat and due to the fact that neither M. Costa nor M. Grenouille can swim. Lucas has been following the cat lead and a neighbor tells him that the cat always comes out of a neighboring house and goes to another, annoying everyone because of the dog. Lucas calls Jeanne to come to her own house because it is related to the burglaries. After she arrives they head up to Nico’s to wait.

After shaking the rest of the gang, Nico goes back to his place and finds Zoé there, as he is about to enter the house he is arrested by Jeanne and Lucas, Claudine tells Jeanne that Nico kidnapped Zoé. Jeanne and Lucas take Nico in their police car and while driving to the station, Nico tells Jeanne that she made a mistake and that Zoé is in great danger, he gets the cat to attack Lucas who is driving and uses the opportunity to grab Jeanne’s gun and take over the situation, after stopping he tells Jeanne that he is going to stop Costa and save Zoé. Jeanne becomes suspicious and orders Lucas to take her home. As they arrive they see that indeed Zoé and Claudine are not there. Claudine has taken Zoé to M. Costa’s house and they have her locked in one of the rooms while drinking champagne. Claudine applies more of her usual perfume that makes everyone else sick, they open the window and the scent reaches Nico and the cat, who always sneezes at Claudine’s smell and it leads Nico to Zoé. After cutting the power down he puts on his usual night goggles and sneaks into the house and whisks Zoé away right under the nose of M. Patate who is sulking because he is stuck with the child and not drinking champagne with the rest of the gang. At the last moment Nico’s presence is discovered and once again he escapes with Zoé over the roof tops with M. Costa in pursuit. The chase takes them up to Notre Dame de Paris, Nico leaves Zoé in one of the terraces and teases Costa to go after him, they both fall because the gargoyles cannot take their weight but Costa is saved because he grabs another gargoyle while Nico is saved by Jeanne. Costa manages to trap Zoé again and jumps over to a nearby crane followed by Jeanne, Nico and the cat. Costa manages to push the cat over the edge and Nico jumps to save it, leaving Jeanne to confront Costa by herself; Jeanne has been having waking nightmares about Costa but she rises above them and uses her personal defense training to free Zoé and disorient Costa who falls from the crane. Jeanne tries to save Costa with the help of Nico, by grabbing him by his shirt; Costa has banged his head against the crane very hard and becomes mad and has a hallucination that the statue has come to rescue him so he jumps off the crane’s hook into the hands of the statue, falling to his death. The rest of the gang, including Claudine, are arrested and Zoé has now started talking again. The next winter, the cat goes over to Nico’s but is let in by Jeanne, from the window it can be seen that Jeanne, Zoé and Nico are a new family. Nico gives a gift to Jeanne, a snow globe with Notre Dame in it.

Nico is always followed by a black cat. The following morning, the cat wakes in a house with a little girl, catches a lizard and gives it to the girl. Zoé, hearing Jeanne, her mother, calls her to come in and look at her lizards, but Jeanne is too busy on the phone to take much notice of what she is shown. At nightfall, the cat leaves and goes to find Nico. On the way the cat walks on walls and teases a dog that barks incessantly causing its owner to throw a shoe at it. Nico gives the cat a bracelet in the shape of fish, which it gives to Zoé. Her mother sees the bracelet and asks Zoé to give it to her. Before leaving, Zoé sees a picture in her mother's dossier file of a man Victor Costa. Jeanne takes the bracelet and gives it to Lucas, a colleague of hers at the police station who asks her to see if it matches up to any of the items stolen at one the most recent burglaries in the Rue Mouffetard. Jeanne is commissioned to handle the security of a huge African statue that has been the target of M. Costa and that cost her husband his life. The statue is being moved soon and will be the last opportunity for Costa to get his hands on it. Victor Costa has been indeed planning how to steal the statue with his minions, M. Bébé , M. Hulot, M. Grenouille , M. Patate . When the bracelet does indeed turn up, Lucas follows the lead up to Nico's. Claudine has been watching Zoé, but fails to notice that she has followed the cat.

Zoé tries to leave but she is caught by Claudine but at the last minute Nico comes back, who locks the mobsters in the cellar. Nico escapes with Zoé on his back jumping over the roof tops with M. Costa and his gang in pursuit after they broke the door down. Nico leaves Zoé near the zoo, she must follow the cat back to his place while he distracts the thieves. The gang is close by and they all follow Nico but M. Costa discovers a piece of Zoé’s t-shirt in the bushes and orders M. Grenouille to follow him after the child in the zoo where they come close to catching her but she escapes in a boat and due to the fact that neither M. Costa nor M. Grenouille can swim.

Suddenly a hurricane strikes, blowing Morris’s writing out of the book and blowing him off the balcony. While Morris frantically grabs for his book, the hurricane blows away the buildings. After the storm, Morris finds the city and its residents devastated. He walks through the streets strewn with book pages and into the countryside. There he sees a woman fly past, magically suspended by flying books which she is holding with ribbons. She sends one of the books down to Morris. The book’s pages flip back and forth to animate an illustration of Humpty Dumpty, who urges Morris to follow him. The flying book takes Morris to a library where other flying books live. Morris finds no humans there, but notices several portraits on the wall, one of which is the woman he had seen. Morris then becomes the proprietor of the library. He takes care of the books, even saving the life of an early French edition of Jules Verne’s From the Earth to the Moon after it suffers a catastrophic injury falling from a shelf.The large book on which Morris sleeps is the same title; its inclusion may reference the studio's name ""Moonbot"". The library also includes Moon globes and in one scene the Moon is featured prominently in a window. He also gives out books to those who visit the library from the city still suffering from the effects of the storm. Eventually Morris begins to rewrite his memoir, sharing passages with the flying books who gather around him on the grassy hill opposite the library. Years later Morris, now an old man, finally completes the book. Satisfied with his life’s work, he closes the book and heads for the door. The flying books swirl about him and Morris becomes young again. He then flies away, carried by flying books like the woman earlier.

Rumors that the strange foal is cursed spread and, before long, he is blamed for the drought that sets into the Great Karoo. When even his father, the leader of the herd, blames him for the lack of rain and the subsequent death of his mother, the outcast zebra leaves the confines of his home knowing that he cannot survive in the herd without all his stripes. Khumba ventures beyond the fence - vulnerable to the ferocious Leopard, Phango, who controls the waterholes and terrorizes the animals in the Great Karoo. Khumba is rescued from an opportunistic wild dog by a quirky duo: a wildebeest and an ostrich. Mama V is a self-confessed free spirit who does not want to be the average stay-at-home mom, like other wildebeest. Ironically, she mothers Bradley, a flamboyant but insecure ostrich who overcompensates for his scraggily feathers. When a mystical mantis appears to the foal, drawing a map to what could be interpreted as either water or stripes, the duo join Khumba on his quest in the hope that their own search for a safe waterhole is over. On their journey, Khumba encounters a colorful range of characters including a migrating herd of Springbok in search of greener  pastures; a new age, bohemian community living safely within the confines of a luxurious national park; an endangered Riverine Rabbit who has survived extinction by mastering a myriad of skills ranging from impersonations to beat-boxing; a group of hysterical Dassies  who fanatically worship the Mighty Black Eagle and Nora, a loony, solitary Merino sheep living on an abandoned farm. Through these interactions, Khumba begins to learn that diversity is essential for survival and that one's difference can, in fact, be one's strength.

Meanwhile at a house only a few yards away, a hefty man is napping on a chair but gets awakened by their act. To silence them, the man grabs and rolls out bowling ball, knocking Felix and the other cats off their feet. Felix, however, still insist to go on performing as he plays a flute and his friends dance. Awakened once more, the man takes out an ether sprayer and showers its contents onto the cats. While his friends fall into a snooze, Felix decides to have his sleep at home. Felix enters his apartment, and lies on the sofa. But before he can rest long enough, his dwarf master calls him over. Felix comes in and hears about the dwarf's complaint about an insomnia problem. To assist his master, the cat offers a glass of warm milk but to no effect. The dwarf is still unable to sleep, and therefore craves for some entertainment instead. Felix then plays a clarinet, and the toy soldiers start dancing to his music. After moving around for a few moments, one of the little soldiers fires a small cannon, piercing a picture on a wall with its projectile. The dwarf was amazed by the presentation, and asks Felix to handover the cannon. When Felix gives it and suddenly turns around, the hostile dwarf aims the small weapon at him and fires. Felix was struck at the back and frightenedly flees the apartment. Out in the streets, Felix looks for suitable resting places. He then climbs up a telephone pole, and lies down on a set of pants hanging on one of the lines. Because the lines are brittle, the one holding the pants momentarily snaps, and Felix plummets back to the pavement. Felix wanders further in the neighborhood until he sees a small house on the other side of a fence. He enters it, only to be chased out by the dog inside. Still wanting to take room, the cat stood on the house's roof and blows into the stack, pushing the dog outside. Felix re-enters the house through the stack and immediately closes the door, locking the canine out. The heart-broken dog starts weeping so much that the area is soon flooded by its tears. As a result, the little house starts to float away. Riding on the floating house overtime, Felix finds himself landing on the Dark Continent. After being chase by a hippo, the cat suddenly runs into a mountain lion. Thus the two felines started pummeling each other with punches.

The well is full of women, all with long hair, all dressed in night-dresses. Thirteen years after the original film, two mysterious suicides- one at a bus station, and the other involving a schoolgirl prompt Detective Koiso  and his partner to investigate a string of mysterious deaths. The deaths involve video played on devices, with a voice saying ""You're not the one"", just before the deaths. While Koiso is unconvinced, his partner deduces that the deaths are the result of a cursed video that online artist Kashiwada Seiji . Akane Ayukawa , teacher of the schoolgirl who died, discovers that the schoolgirl's best friend Lisa had been looking into the cursed video. It turns out that the video had been deleted but the Error 404 message in its wake prompts the video to play when the viewer is alone. In it Kashiwada says ""It's showtime."" and is seen ""committing suicide"" by allowing himself to be killed by a mysterious long-haired woman. When the video ends, Lisa is attacked, with Akane arriving just in time to save her. The mysterious ghost latches on to Akane saying ""You are the one."" but Akane screams and the computer is destroyed. Meanwhile Koiso and his partner scout Kashiwada's apartment, noting the furniture and decorative wallpaper, that it looks artificial . The landlady notes that everything is superficial. It is revealed that Akane is a telekinetic and displayed her power years ago when a raving maniac attacked her high school years back. Though she saved the school, she was branded a freak. However a boy is drawn to her and appreciates her abilities. He grows up to be her boyfriend, Takanori Andou . She soon realizes that the video is actually targeted at her when at their home, the video plays and the woman appears. Takanori and Akane run to the street. However, multiple screens show the woman attacking. Takanori and Akane run to a street, where they believe themselves safe. However, it turns out to be a large LCD display truck where a giant version of the ghost snatches Takanori away. Detective Koiso continues to doubt the existence of the film, even when it is revealed that the original broadcast of the online video killed its initial viewers and employees of the site where it was uploaded- that is until his partner commits suicide in front of him. Koiso makes his way to Kashiwada's apartment eager to find answers and he discovers the wallpaper is actually a horde of white butterflies hiding notes and history. Kashiwada had been attempting to resurrect Sadako Yamamura,  as revenge against the human populace for persecuting him. He initially kidnapped long-haired women and threw them down the well, alive. However, when it was revealed that a body could not be found that way, he orchestrated the ""cursed video"" so that the video would find the perfect host for her. Koiso finds Akane  and the two of them journey to the old Yamamura household. It no longer had the inn, and a ""new"" decrepit mall was beside the well. However, upon approach to the well, a freakish-looking Sadako facsimile appeared and attacked Koiso, biting on his neck furiously. It turns out that the women that had been thrown into the well had become imperfect versions of Sadako. They attack Akane, but with stealth and resistance, Akane prevails against the imperfect Sadakos that attack. When she arrives at the center of the derelict building, she discovers Takanori had been trapped in an iPhone at the center of the room. A legion of imperfect Sadakos arrive but her fear triggers her telekinetic powers and decimates them. Akane is transported to the roof where the ""real"" Sadako had been waiting. Sadako notes that they are exactly the same. Akane says they are not, that Sadako uses her powers to destroy while she helps people. Seeing Takanori with a knife to his throat, Akane trades herself for his life. Sadako agrees and goes into her. Akane is overlain with an impossible amount of the ghost's hair and is buried inside it. Takanori, now free from Sadako's thrall, destroys the iPhone.

Detective Koiso continues to doubt the existence of the film, even when it is revealed that the original broadcast of the online video killed its initial viewers and employees of the site where it was uploaded- that is until his partner commits suicide in front of him. Koiso makes his way to Kashiwada's apartment eager to find answers and he discovers the wallpaper is actually a horde of white butterflies hiding notes and history. Kashiwada had been attempting to resurrect Sadako Yamamura,  as revenge against the human populace for persecuting him. He initially kidnapped long-haired women and threw them down the well, alive. However, when it was revealed that a body could not be found that way, he orchestrated the ""cursed video"" so that the video would find the perfect host for her. Koiso finds Akane  and the two of them journey to the old Yamamura household. It no longer had the inn, and a ""new"" decrepit mall was beside the well. However, upon approach to the well, a freakish-looking Sadako facsimile appeared and attacked Koiso, biting on his neck furiously. It turns out that the women that had been thrown into the well had become imperfect versions of Sadako. They attack Akane, but with stealth and resistance, Akane prevails against the imperfect Sadakos that attack. When she arrives at the center of the derelict building, she discovers Takanori had been trapped in an iPhone at the center of the room. A legion of imperfect Sadakos arrive but her fear triggers her telekinetic powers and decimates them. Akane is transported to the roof where the ""real"" Sadako had been waiting. Sadako notes that they are exactly the same. Akane says they are not, that Sadako uses her powers to destroy while she helps people. Seeing Takanori with a knife to his throat, Akane trades herself for his life. Sadako agrees and goes into her. Akane is overlain with an impossible amount of the ghost's hair and is buried inside it. Takanori, now free from Sadako's thrall, destroys the iPhone. The roof gives and Akane drops to the floor below covered in Sadako's hair. However, she manages to make it out alive. Just outside the building beside the well, Kashiwada's landlord moves away and her words ""Isn't it all artificial?"" echo... In the post-credits scene, the intro to Kashiwada's video plays again.

They are caught having sex, and Mary is arrested. She is pregnant, and Donny names the kid Han Solo Berger; Donny becomes a celebrity because of what has happened, but is forgotten as he grows up and loses contact with his son. 2012, Donny is a 42-year-old slacker who has squandered all his money. He drinks beer constantly, and spends his time at a local strip club with his friends, bartender Brie and stripper Champale. Donny's son no longer speaks to or associates with him. Angry about Donny's incompetence as a father, he tells acquaintances that his parents died in an explosion when he was nine years old, has gone on to become a successful businessman, has lost a lot of weight and is no longer the obese child that Donny knows, and is about to marry a rich young woman named Jamie. Han has arrived at the Cape Cod house of his boss, Steve Spirou, the site of the wedding; while he doesn't get along well with Jamie's brother Chad, a Marine he has just met for the first time, he is well liked by the other guests. Donny learns that he owes $43,000 to the IRS in back-taxes and will be imprisoned for three years if he doesn't repay the money by the end of the weekend. He places a long-odds wager on morbidly obese athlete Tubby Tuke to win an upcoming marathon, but realizes that he needs another plan. He visits TV producer Randall Morgan, who had produced shows for Donny during his brief period of celebrity, and Morgan offers him $50,000 if he can organize a reunion with Han and Ms. McGarricle at the women's prison. Donny arrives at Cape Cod to try to convince Han to participate. Because he had previously told people that his parents had died, Han introduces Donny as an old friend; Donny elaborates with a heroic backstory and, despite his extremely crude behavior, quickly becomes well-liked by the other guests, at the expense of Han's popularity – to the point where Han's best man, co-worker Phil, passes the role of best man on to Donny. Donny tries to convince Han to come to the women's prison to see Ms. McGarricle , but Han fights constantly with Donny about his father's immaturity, both now and during his childhood, even revealing that he has type 2 diabetes due to Donny allowing him to eat whatever he wanted when he was a child. When Donny later hears Jamie yelling at Han, he tries to be fatherly by encouraging him to stand up for himself; he follows this advice the next day at the wedding rehearsal, getting into a fistfight with Father McNally. Donny then has to save Han by telling his future in-laws about church creeping him out after an explosion that killed his parents inside of it. Donny joins Han and his other friends at the bachelor party, which is a relaxing, alcohol-free visit to a spa organized by Phil. Donny proceeds to offend everybody at the spa , before convincing the others to go to the strip club with him, where Han bonds with Brie, and everybody gets drunk, high and raucous. Donny sends the other guests home, but Phil stays and receives fellatio from a disabled stripper with a neck brace, then he and Han meet up with Vanilla Ice, a former friend of Donny's from his B-grade celebrity days. Once Donny apologizes to Ice for sleeping with his mother , the three wreak havoc through the night before returning to Steve's house, where both Donny and Ice have sex with Steve's mother and a drunk Han has sex with, then vomits on, the mannequin wearing Jamie's wedding dress. Throughout the night, Donny and Han bond. Han tells Donny that he has given him a present for being best man and Han agrees to visit Ms. McGarricle in prison; Donny, knowing that the meeting is a television set-up, tells him not to go. The following day, Jamie forces Han to take the dress to the dry cleaner and Han decides to visit his mother anyway. Donny rushes to prison to stop the meeting, but arrives too late; Randall ambushes Han, Donny, and Ms. McGarricle with a film crew and an enraged Han leaves. He refuses to sign a release form for the television appearance, leaving Donny with no money from the stunt. Donny returns to Steve's home to retrieve his belongings and overhears Jamie on a phone call, indicating that she is cheating on Han with Steve. He tries to tell Han at the rehearsal dinner that night, but Jamie comes up with a story to cover her tracks. Defeated, Donny leaves and returns to the strip club, where his friend Kenny convinces him to return and earn Jamie's forgiveness. Donny heads to the hotel where Jamie is staying, only to find her having sex with Chad, her own brother, whom Donny learns is actually a jazz dancer pretending to be a Marine. Jamie gives Donny the money he needs in exchange for his silence. Donny opens Han Solo's present to find an oven mitt, which Donny had used as a sockpuppet to comfort Han during his childhood. Touched by Han's acknowledgement of their father-son relationship, Donny realizes that he must stop the wedding, in spite of his need for Jamie's hush money. He and Vanilla Ice interrupt the wedding ceremony and Donny reveals that he is Han's father. Donny tears up Jamie's check and urges her to whisper the truth to Han – which a newly self-assured Han exposes to the entire crowd. In the ensuing fight, Jamie and Chad are both knocked unconscious, while Han accepts Donny. The following day at the strip club, Han reveals that he is dating Brie. He offers Donny the money to help pay for the unpaid taxes, but he refuses stating that it's time for him to grow up and accept responsibility. Donny is preparing to go to prison, intending to rekindle his relationship with Ms. McGarricle when both are released in 2015 – when suddenly on television, they see Tubby Tuke complete an unlikely come-from-behind victory in his marathon, winning Donny $160,000 from his earlier wager, more than enough to keep him out of prison.

Miriam is concerned they may take their relationship to a physical level, but André seems unconcerned.

For years they have slept in separate rooms, forgoing any physical affection. One day Kay  tells Arnold  she has paid for them to undergo a week of intense marriage counseling with Dr. Bernie Feld  in a coastal resort town in Maine. Arnold, a creature of plodding, unimaginative routine, denies their marriage is in trouble and resists getting on a plane for a week of marriage therapy. The real challenge comes in sessions with Dr. Feld as they both try to articulate their feelings, revitalize their relationship, and find the spark that caused them to fall in love in the first place. In daily sessions in his office, Dr. Feld counsels them together, each time asking increasingly frank questions about their sex life and feelings toward one another. Arnold is angry and defensive, rigidly resistant to change, and unwilling to see the depth of his wife's disappointment. Discouraged by Arnold's recalcitrance, angry and crying, Kay goes alone to a bar where she vents to the bartendress and learns nobody else is having any sex. Arnold visits a nautical museum. Back together, they spend the night in the same bed for the first time in years, and Kay awakes in the morning to find Arnold's arm around her. At this sign of progress, Dr. Feld urges new measures. They make halting attempts at intimacy on the bed of their budget motel and again in a movie theater, but this time with disastrous results. Arnold finally takes the initiative to arrange a romantic dinner and a night at a luxury inn, where they attempt to make love in front of a fireplace, but the grand design fails. At their final session, Dr. Feld tells them they've made much progress and should take up couples therapy back home. But back in Omaha, old habits resume. Kay offers to pet sit for a fellow employee and packs a bag to stay there, as a first step in a permanent break with Arnold. With Kay already in her bedroom, Arnold ascends the stairs to bed and pauses at her door, but does not knock. Both are shown in bed trying to sleep. It is Arnold who arises, puts on his bathrobe, and enters his wife's bedroom. Kay sits up as he sits down beside her and they tenderly embrace.

Each of the three wake up in a different part of the gates of Hell, with all of them finding an envelope with their name on it that contains a ticket to the carnival.

Dagny says to herself ""Who is John Galt?"" before crashing into the mountainside. The film returns to eight months earlier. Dagny is trying to discover how the abandoned prototype of an advanced motor she and Hank Rearden found works. Quentin Daniels, the only capable scientist who has not disappeared yet, agrees to help her from his abandoned university laboratory in Utah. Dagny's brother James Taggart, president of the family railroad, meets store clerk Cherryl Brooks and brings her to see the performance of a pianist, who disappears during his performance, leaving a note asking ""Who is John Galt?"" Later, during the wedding of James and Cherryl, Dagny's friend Francisco d'Anconia argues with other guests about whether money is evil, and secretly informs Rearden that his copper mine will suffer a devastating explosion the next day. Rearden spends that night with his paramour Dagny. Later he is confronted about the affair by his wife Lillian, who refuses to grant him a divorce in order to maintain her position in society. Rearden sells his advanced-material steel to Ken Danagger's coal mining company, and refuses to sell it to the government in defiance of the newly enacted ""Fair Share"" law that forces businesses to sell to all buyers. The two are charged under the law but Danagger disappears before trial. Rearden makes a statement at trial about the benefits of the pursuit of profit, and is given only a token penalty by the court when it is seen that the crowd supports him. However, the government announces a new law that freezes all employment and productions, and requires all patent rights to be transferred to the federal government. Government bureaucrat Wesley Mouch blackmails Rearden into giving up his Rearden Steel patents, using photos of Rearden and Dagny that would damage Dagny's reputation. Dagny leaves her COO post at the railroad when her prized John Galt line is dissembled due to lack of business. During her absence, a Taggart Transcontinental train collides with a military train in a tunnel in South Colorado, due in large part to human error by Dagny's poorly-trained replacement. Francisco tries to dissuade Dagny from returning to the railroad to supervise repairs, as he had earlier tried to talk Rearden into leaving his business, but she does nonetheless. Dagny takes a train to Colorado to show her faith in the railway. The train stops due to an engine failure. The technician who comes to fix it used to work for 20th Century Motor, which produced the motor Dagny found. The technician tells Dagny how the need-based reward system in his company failed, and his coworker John Galt left the company to ""stop the motor of the world"". Dagny calls Daniels, who tells her that he is quitting. Dagny buys a small airplane nearby, and flies to Utah to try to convince him not to do so. While landing, she sees the scientist get into a plane on the airstrip. After a pursuit in the air—the opening scene of the film—Dagny's plane crashes in a valley hidden by stealth technology. Dagny crawls to the edge of her crashed plane, where she is greeted by John Galt. As the screen fades, a quote from the Atlas Shrugged novel is displayed."

The joy of finding the comet is short-lived, however, when it is determined that it may hit the Earth in just eight days. Dreiser is summoned to see the President  at his vacation home, along with a number of other experts, to discuss the situation. Astronomer Jason Voight , a specialist in near-Earth objects, shocks the group by telling them that the comet will hit within 50 miles of Phoenix. Voight urges the President to order an evacuation of Phoenix and the surrounding area, but the President ultimately leaves that decision in the hands of Arizona's governor, Michael Ritchie . The President does order the MIRV nosecone of a Minuteman ICBM be launched into space aboard a Titan-Centaur rocket, so that an attempt can be made at destroying the comet. After talking with the President, Governor Ritchie meets with a number of key people, including his chief of staff Elliott Kirkwood , insurance executive Paul Gilliam , newspaper owner David Allan , and emergency management officer Wayne Lustus . David's wife, television station owner Sharon Allan , gets wind of the meeting, but is unable to get David to tell her what's going on. Ultimately, Sharon asks Carol , a reporter at David's newspaper with whom David is having an affair, to find out. Voight is adamant that the people be told what's going to happen to Phoenix. Sharon Allan is the only media person in town who is willing to discuss the issue with him. Ultimately, Voight convinces her to put him on the air and describes what will happen when the comet hits. Voight's broadcast has one desired effect - people begin leaving the city for safety. But it also leads to businesses being looted. Governor Ritchie instructs Elliott to report the broadcast to the FCC, in an effort to get Sharon's television station's license to broadcast revoked. The air force's attempt to intercept the comet is broadcast on national television. Both of the nuclear warheads detonate behind the comet's nucleus, in its tail. Once it has been confirmed that the comet is still on course to hit the Earth, the network broadcast is interrupted with instructions from civil defense urging citizens of Phoenix to begin leaving the area immediately. Governor Ritchie, now understanding the real danger posed by the comet, resolves to withdraw the FCC protest against Sharon's station and takes to the airwaves to urge people to evacuate the city. The day of the comet's impact, Voight tells Jennifer to meet him in Tucson, so that they can go off to Mexico together. Jennifer begs him to go directly to Tucson with her, but he insists on taking some scientific equipment to the comet's projected impact point, to record atmospheric and seismic data from the impact. When he gets to the impact area, in the desert outside the city, he finds a large group of Pima Indians whose truck has broken down. Voight calls for help on his Citizens Band radio and is promised that choppers will pick them up as soon as possible. Not knowing if the help is really going to come, Voight gives the keys to his car to one of the adults in the stranded group, and after packing all the young children into the car, gives the man instructions to head away from the impact zone. Evacuees clog the roads leading out of Phoenix, and many of them pour into Sky Harbor Airport to catch flights out of the city. That includes Paul Gilliam, his wife Ellen , and their daughter Paula . When her parents leave their car to go into the airport terminal, Paula stays behind to look for some jewelry her mother has forgotten. This gives Paula the opportunity to get back to her boyfriend, Tom Reardon , a rough-and-tumble college student with whom she has a romantic relationship and of whom her father disapproves. Tom's grandmother  refuses to leave her home, and Tom is unwilling to leave her to face the comet's impact alone. Tom, Mrs. Reardon, and Paula begin preparing for the coming disaster. In the hours before impact, Stan Webster , who is leading a group of young boys  on a survival hike, finds out about the comet over the radio. With no shelter immediately available, Webster and the boys dig themselves into the desert floor and cover themselves with sleeping bags in a desperate attempt to survive the impact. Governor Ritchie and Elliott try to fly out of Phoenix, but air traffic control refuses clearance. Elliott orders the pilot to fly them out, which the pilot reluctantly tries to do. Their small aircraft bursts into flames after hitting a larger commercial plane, tearing the landing gear off the commercial plane and forcing it to be diverted to San Diego. Meanwhile, Ann Webster , who has been in the family station wagon looking for her husband and son, has broken down in the desert. David Allan, who had been drafted to help evacuate patients from a local hospital, takes refuge with them in the basement of a bank building downtown. Sharon Allan, who keeps her television station on the air until the last possible moment, rushes to the lowest levels of a parking garage with several members of her staff in the moments before impact. Jennifer Dreiser arrives safely in Tucson before the comet hits. The choppers never arrive to airlift Voight and the stranded Pima Indian adults out of the impact zone. As the comet makes its final approach, Voight looks up and sees the fire in the sky that he had warned so many people about. Voight and the others are all killed when the comet hits. Strong winds and earth tremors devastate Phoenix. The bank building's basement, though rattled by the impact, holds up and David survives. Sharon is abandoned by her colleagues when they think the parking garage is going to cave in. One of them eventually makes it to the bank building for medical treatment after the impact and tells David where Sharon is. David finds Sharon amidst the rubble of the garage, and after a tearful reunion, they vow to work on their struggling marriage. The Reardons and Paula Gilliam survive, too, though Mrs. Reardon's home is destroyed. Stan Webster and his son, riding to a refugee center with the rest of their hiking group through the desert in the back of a military truck, spot Ann Webster walking along with a small group of survivors. They jump off the truck and greet her with hugs, happy that she survived the impact.

Jennifer begs him to go directly to Tucson with her, but he insists on taking some scientific equipment to the comet's projected impact point, to record atmospheric and seismic data from the impact. When he gets to the impact area, in the desert outside the city, he finds a large group of Pima Indians whose truck has broken down. Voight calls for help on his Citizens Band radio and is promised that choppers will pick them up as soon as possible. Not knowing if the help is really going to come, Voight gives the keys to his car to one of the adults in the stranded group, and after packing all the young children into the car, gives the man instructions to head away from the impact zone. Evacuees clog the roads leading out of Phoenix, and many of them pour into Sky Harbor Airport to catch flights out of the city. That includes Paul Gilliam, his wife Ellen , and their daughter Paula . When her parents leave their car to go into the airport terminal, Paula stays behind to look for some jewelry her mother has forgotten. This gives Paula the opportunity to get back to her boyfriend, Tom Reardon , a rough-and-tumble college student with whom she has a romantic relationship and of whom her father disapproves. Tom's grandmother  refuses to leave her home, and Tom is unwilling to leave her to face the comet's impact alone. Tom, Mrs. Reardon, and Paula begin preparing for the coming disaster. In the hours before impact, Stan Webster , who is leading a group of young boys  on a survival hike, finds out about the comet over the radio. With no shelter immediately available, Webster and the boys dig themselves into the desert floor and cover themselves with sleeping bags in a desperate attempt to survive the impact. Governor Ritchie and Elliott try to fly out of Phoenix, but air traffic control refuses clearance. Elliott orders the pilot to fly them out, which the pilot reluctantly tries to do. Their small aircraft bursts into flames after hitting a larger commercial plane, tearing the landing gear off the commercial plane and forcing it to be diverted to San Diego. Meanwhile, Ann Webster , who has been in the family station wagon looking for her husband and son, has broken down in the desert. David Allan, who had been drafted to help evacuate patients from a local hospital, takes refuge with them in the basement of a bank building downtown. Sharon Allan, who keeps her television station on the air until the last possible moment, rushes to the lowest levels of a parking garage with several members of her staff in the moments before impact. Jennifer Dreiser arrives safely in Tucson before the comet hits. The choppers never arrive to airlift Voight and the stranded Pima Indian adults out of the impact zone. As the comet makes its final approach, Voight looks up and sees the fire in the sky that he had warned so many people about. Voight and the others are all killed when the comet hits. Strong winds and earth tremors devastate Phoenix. The bank building's basement, though rattled by the impact, holds up and David survives. Sharon is abandoned by her colleagues when they think the parking garage is going to cave in. One of them eventually makes it to the bank building for medical treatment after the impact and tells David where Sharon is. David finds Sharon amidst the rubble of the garage, and after a tearful reunion, they vow to work on their struggling marriage. The Reardons and Paula Gilliam survive, too, though Mrs. Reardon's home is destroyed. Stan Webster and his son, riding to a refugee center with the rest of their hiking group through the desert in the back of a military truck, spot Ann Webster walking along with a small group of survivors. They jump off the truck and greet her with hugs, happy that she survived the impact.

Afterwards, Robbie approaches Thaddeus and negotiates a sale of three bottles for £250,000. They plan to make the exchange in Glasgow, and so begin the trek home, but inadvertently break two of their four bottles during an encounter with the police. Robbie gets furious, but goes ahead with meeting Thaddeus, and negotiates a sale for £100,000 and a permanent job far away from Glasgow. Robbie reveals to his friends, that he didn't sell two bottles, but one. The scene cuts to show Harry coming home to find a bottle of Irn Bru sitting on his kitchen table next to an open window, with a note thanking him and presenting his ""angels' share"" next to a newspaper piece showing a photo of the payback group next to the cask.

In his  fantasies he sees himself as a superhero Kosmoboy, who, together with a giant Kind Robot  battles against the terrifying monster robot Mrakovlast . Everything changes when on August 6th, 2008 Kseniya gets a call from her ex-husband and Artyom's father Ossetian Zaur , who serves as a peacekeeper in South Ossetia. He misses Artyom very much and asks her to send the boy to his parents, who live in the village of Sidamonta, right next to the administrative border separating South Ossetia from the rest of Georgia. Zaur assures her that everything is perfectly safe. Kseniya, after some hesitation, agrees, because she wants to take a vacation in Sochi with her new boyfriend, a bank employee, Yegor , who can't find understanding with Artyom and Kseniya needs some private time with her new lover. But she agrees under a condition, that Zaur sends her son back immediately as soon as she asks him to. The next day, after her son's departure, Kseniya learns from Internet articles that South Ossetia is turning into a conflict zone. She calls Zaur and demands that Artyom is brought back to Russia. Zaur, seeing his parents happy with their so-missed grandson, and Artyom obviously enjoying his vacation in the Caucasus, tries to convince Kseniya, that those Internet articles are maybe not true, but she does not want to listen to him. Ksenia, having a bad feeling, comes to Ygor in his bank, but unexpectedly he proves himself to be from very ugly party, when he says to her, that he least wants to be got involved in her family problems and said, the ""she's like a little, because she should be taught throughout"". And when they go into the elevator, then Yegor clearly gives her to understand that he even taught her to really feel the sexual orgasm, and he is sure that she does not pretend. To humiliate Yegor in response, Ksenia begins to repeat: ""Yeah, Yegor, Yeah!"" and repeats it each time louder until it becomes clear that she simulates an orgasm, copying well known scene from When Harry Met Sally. Other people in the elevator silently begin to laugh and when the elevator doors opened, Kseniya, together with the other leaves, and humiliated Yegor continues to stand still. Ksenia flies to Vladikavkaz, where she takes a bus through the Roki tunnel into the pre-war South Ossetia. Suddenly, the bus is exposed to attack of the ATGM. Kseniya and several other passengers miraculously survive. Russian military reconnaissance unit assists in their evacuation. Among them is the commander of the reconnaissance Lyoha . Kseniya persuades him to take her to Ossetian capital Tskhinvali and turns on the central square of Tskhinvali on a memorable night from 7th to 8th August 2008, when the city was hit by BM-21 Grad multiple rocket launchers. Kseniya manages to reach the refugee camp in Dzau. Along the way she calls Zaur, who is driving to Sidamonta to evacuate his parents and Artyom. They both decide to meet in Dzau. But Zaur's attempt to evacuate his parents and Artyom falls. When they sit down in his jeep, he and his parents were killed by shells fired by the Georgian tank, and Artyom runs into deep shock from the seen. In Dzau, Kseniya waiting for them to come and calls Artyom on his mobile phone. Artyom, who had just regained consciousness after the explosion, picks it up, but being in a state of shock, only a whisper: ""Mrakovlast was here... Mrakovlast killed all..."". Realising that nobody can help her, she decides to goe into the war zone to save her son. Situation becomes complicated that Artyom has a slipping wound in his temple and he starts to be exposed to hallucinations because of a loss of blood, hiding everything is deeper in the world of his illusions. At the same time Kseniya and Zaur's friend Ilya  with Russian military convoy and journalists get ambushed (events based on real clash between staff convoy of [[58th Army  and Ilya dies killed by Georgian soldier. Ksenya is saved by Lyoha and his comrade, who observed attack on convoy as recon. Lyoha's recon unit has assignment to assist Russian peacekeepers holding defence against Georgian army and evacuate refugees. Kseniya persuades Lyoha to take her along, since peacekeeper's base is not far from home where her son is hiding. En-route to the base Lyoha appears to be smart and professional soldier: when Russian vehicles jump right in front of shooting Georgian tank, Lyoha is cold and counting from 1 to 7, because recharging time of tank gun is 6 seconds. On count seven, both Russian vehicles make sudden turn thus escaping tank's artillery fire. When recon unit reaches the base, Lyoha finds out that quantity of refugees is ten times more than initially reported and his unit simply has no transport to evacuate them all. The only solution is to move all refugees from peacekeeper's base still under attack and seek for transport. This will take 6–7 hours before Lyoha can assist Ksenya and she decides to reach her son alone. Lyoha has no choice but accept it, provides Ksenia with flashlight, map and walkie-talkie and starts evacuation or refugees blocking line of Georgian fire with Russian tank which ammunition has run out . Refugees and Ksenya successfully evacuated from the base and separate, Kseniya running to save her son. Ksenya luckily sneaked past small Georgian army unit, busy repairing one of their Jeeps and finds her son, but he is wounded and unable to walk. In despair, she returns to location of Georgian soldiers and steals one of their cars. Soldiers seeing one of their Jeeps escaping start to shoot, but too late to stop her. Kseniya picks up her son just seconds before Georgian soldiers appear nearby hunting for their stolen car. Trying to escape them Ksenya rushes with her car right in the middle of large Georgian army position. One of Georgian tanks shoots at invisible Russian positions, but starts to turn his main gun to fire at Ksenya's car as soon as they noticed her. Ksenya recalls her experience of traveling with recon unit and counts to seven. On count seven she sharply turns the wheel, tank fires but misses her, destroying Georgian armored vehicle instead. Georgian positions are taking large field and Ksenya evidently going to be captured or shot, but at this moment Sukhoi Su-25 wing makes massive air strike on position of Georgian army and Ksenya is driving out of resulting chaos. Feeling safety she stops the car but assaulted by Georgian soldier  who wants to get her car to retreat from approaching Russian army. Kseniya explains him that her son is wounded and she had stolen Georgian Jeep to save him. She begs soldier to let her go argumenting that soldier's mother would do the same for him. Georgian soldier accepts her arguments though his slowly approaching and evidently wounded comrade shouts ""just shoot her"". Soldier explains that Kseniya will be immediately shot by Russians as soon as they will see approaching Georgian military vehicle. He proposes to get her as close as possible to Russian positions and she agrees. Soldier drives Jeep with Kseniya away from his wounded comrade who curses in response to his command ""wait here"". Soldier drops Kseniya in vicinity of approaching Russian tanks and returns back, encouragingly signalling a honk and waving his hand. Kseniya walks over hilltop to approaching Russian tanks and leading tank stops right in front of her. Tank commander asks her if she speaks Russian and after she nodds shortly demands her to get away from the road grumbling that having such tempo their tank will never reach Tbilisi. Ksenya just smiles, steps to the roadside and continues to walk towards masses of approaching Russian soldiers. Her son is treated in the hospital and she is laying near him telling endless story about Cosmoboy and Kind Robot, but suddenly her son interrups her and asking her to tell story about his father, not about robots. Later they wait for helicopter evacuating them to Russia and Lyoha finds them both, while they are waiting for boarding. Ksenya is happy to see him and asks about results of war. Lyoha shortly replies ""The war is over. We won. Stopped in Gori"". Both Ksenya and Artyom cheerfully say goodbye to Lyoha and board helicopter. In the next scene answering machine in Kseniya's apartment is shown playing numerous messages from Yegor who says he is ""missing her for the whole day that passed"" and asking to excuse him. The last message however is from Lyoha who simply tells ""Hi, Kseniya""."

In despair, she returns to location of Georgian soldiers and steals one of their cars. Soldiers seeing one of their Jeeps escaping start to shoot, but too late to stop her. Kseniya picks up her son just seconds before Georgian soldiers appear nearby hunting for their stolen car. Trying to escape them Ksenya rushes with her car right in the middle of large Georgian army position. One of Georgian tanks shoots at invisible Russian positions, but starts to turn his main gun to fire at Ksenya's car as soon as they noticed her. Ksenya recalls her experience of traveling with recon unit and counts to seven. On count seven she sharply turns the wheel, tank fires but misses her, destroying Georgian armored vehicle instead. Georgian positions are taking large field and Ksenya evidently going to be captured or shot, but at this moment Sukhoi Su-25 wing makes massive air strike on position of Georgian army and Ksenya is driving out of resulting chaos. Feeling safety she stops the car but assaulted by Georgian soldier  who wants to get her car to retreat from approaching Russian army. Kseniya explains him that her son is wounded and she had stolen Georgian Jeep to save him. She begs soldier to let her go argumenting that soldier's mother would do the same for him. Georgian soldier accepts her arguments though his slowly approaching and evidently wounded comrade shouts ""just shoot her"". Soldier explains that Kseniya will be immediately shot by Russians as soon as they will see approaching Georgian military vehicle. He proposes to get her as close as possible to Russian positions and she agrees. Soldier drives Jeep with Kseniya away from his wounded comrade who curses in response to his command ""wait here"". Soldier drops Kseniya in vicinity of approaching Russian tanks and returns back, encouragingly signalling a honk and waving his hand. Kseniya walks over hilltop to approaching Russian tanks and leading tank stops right in front of her. Tank commander asks her if she speaks Russian and after she nodds shortly demands her to get away from the road grumbling that having such tempo their tank will never reach Tbilisi. Ksenya just smiles, steps to the roadside and continues to walk towards masses of approaching Russian soldiers. Her son is treated in the hospital and she is laying near him telling endless story about Cosmoboy and Kind Robot, but suddenly her son interrups her and asking her to tell story about his father, not about robots. Later they wait for helicopter evacuating them to Russia and Lyoha finds them both, while they are waiting for boarding. Ksenya is happy to see him and asks about results of war. Lyoha shortly replies ""The war is over. We won. Stopped in Gori"". Both Ksenya and Artyom cheerfully say goodbye to Lyoha and board helicopter. In the next scene answering machine in Kseniya's apartment is shown playing numerous messages from Yegor who says he is ""missing her for the whole day that passed"" and asking to excuse him. The last message however is from Lyoha who simply tells ""Hi, Kseniya""."

After regaining their bearings, Squeegie figures out and explains to Ornio that they are stuck in the black void of a computer monitor when it's turned off. A computer virus informs the brothers that King Pooper  has kidnapped Princess Perlina . King Pooper intends on forcefully having Perlina help him travel to Earth with a tub full of semen energized by a special generator. Squeegie and Ornio travel through the computer world, encountering other villains who attempt to delay them and hamper their efforts.

King Pooper escapes, and begins to enact his ultimate goal, bluntly explained by Perlina to the Hornio Brothers as ""procreate and create more King Pooper offspring."" While King Pooper hires a prostitute to start his plan, Squeegie theorizes that the generator is the key to King Pooper's scheme and draws up plans to destroy it.

The pair only manage to sell some of their product, and then waste time about town. Frank then visits his friend Vic , a prostitute who holds some of Frank's stash for a fee. Vic wants to have a serious relationship with Frank, but Frank prefers to keep it purely sexual. Frank is visited by a former cellmate, a Swede named Hasse ([[Peter Andersson , and the pair set up a large drug deal. Frank visits his supplier, the Serb drug lord Milo  to get the heroin. Already owing Milo some money, Frank cannot cover the cost of the heroin, but Milo allows him to take the drugs provided that he immediately returns with the money. The deal goes bad, however, when police arrive. In the process of evading the police, Frank dumps the heroin in a pond. At the station, police officers convince Frank that Tonny has delivered a confession that implicates Frank, but he still does not admit to anything. When Frank is released after 24 hours he returns to Milo to explain how he lost the money and the drugs. Milo does not believe Frank's story and demands that he pay back even more than he already owes. Frank then immediately seeks Tonny out and savagely beats him with a baseball bat. Milo's cynical henchman Radovan  accompanies Frank to help him collect on some of his own debts to use toward his debt with Milo. The pair have a friendly conversation and Radovan shares his secret desire to open a restaurant. However, when Radovan tries to force an addict customer of Frank's to rob a bank to cover his debt, the addict commits suicide. As Frank makes other disastrous attempts to earn money, Vic becomes increasingly insistent that they behave as a couple. He takes her to several clubs and makes plans to drive her to the veterinarian to see her sick dog. Frank finally makes a deal, but his drug mule betrays him and switches the heroin for baking soda. Radovan drops his friendly demeanor and begins threatening Frank with serious injury should he fail to pay up soon. Frank goes on a desperate rampage, stealing some money and drugs from a gym of drug-dealing bodybuilders, but he is soon picked up by Radovan and tortured. Frank manages to escape and makes plans to flee with Vic to Spain. After successfully making his final deal in Copenhagen, Frank receives a call from Milo, who promises to accept a token payment to put an end to their feud. When Frank bluntly informs Vic that he will not be going away with her, she steals his stash of money and flees. The film ends with Frank grimly catching his breath as his enemies throughout the city prepare to strike.

The film tells the Hindu mythical story of river Ganga's descent to Earth. For absolution of his ancestor's sins Bhagiratha vows to bring the heavenly river to the Earth. Pleased with his tapasya, Lord Brahma agrees on sending Ganga. But He asks Bhagiratha to pursue Lord Shiva, as only Shiva could break Ganga's fall. Proud with her heavenly presence Ganga agreed to descend only because of Brahma's orders. Her pride made her believe that her fall would only destroy the Earth. But then Shiva trapped her tight in His hair and only let her go when she asked for forgiveness. Her gentle flow after release then absolved Bhagiratha's ancestors.

This is because his father chose not to see Beat's mother on her deathbed, but instead chose to stay at his fashion show. Later, when Beat visits Kirara in a nearby hospital, he meets Mei. The next day, Mei discovers that Beat will be her new classmate. On that day, however, their class was abuzz about the upcoming school festival. The class has always organized a fashion show, since the famous model Miki was in their class. Miki did not like any of her classmates' clothes designs, and threatened to cancel the fashion show. Beat decides to take up the challenge of designing something that Miki will like. Beat first overhauls Satoru's geeky image as a means to prove his ability. He succeeds, and manages to entice Miki and the rest of the class to use his fashion designs in the upcoming fashion show. Satoru also agrees to help Beat design the runway needed for the show, since Satoru is actually skilled in architectural design. The rest of the class also volunteer their services. After Miki publicized herself wearing Beat's designs on her official blog, Beat's designs were widely praised on the internet. However, World Stage, a fashion company, simply copied the designs. They also got Miki, who had a modelling contract with them, to model the stolen designs. This action caused people to cast doubt on the originality of Beat's design, causing friction amongst the class. Beat, hurt by the lack of trust, decides to pull out of the fashion show. The class later learns that their school will be closing down after the school year ends due to the lack of funding. Meanwhile, Kirara's doctor said that she would not live beyond another six months. Beat was extremely upset by this, and this further affected his morale. However, in preparation for this, Beat made many beautiful pajamas for Kirara. During this trying time, Beat starts to become closer to his father, after his father shows him a beautiful wedding dress that was meant for his mother. Mei also manages to persuade him to return to designing. The class's enthusiasm level rose again, and they paraded on the streets to publicize their upcoming fashion show. Mei suddenly confessed her love to Beat one day while he was making his designs. Shocked, Beat tells her that he is not ready for a relationship yet. Beat later finds out from his father's personal assistant the reason why his father abandoned his mother. His father refused to leave the fashion show because Beat's mother told him that if the show was successful, she would also find the strength to overcome her illness. It was then that his respect for his father increased. Before the show, the group was suddenly informed that World Stage had already booked the new event venue that they were planning to use. Miki was also told that by participating in the fashion show, she will break her contract and her future in modelling will be limited. In spite of this, however, Miki decides to continue participating in the show. The class also decided to revert to their original location, their school. It was also decided to hold the fashion show on March 20, the last day of school. With the townspeople help, they managed to prepare the stage in time for the event. Just before the event started, Beat was told that Kirara had suffered a serious infection and would have to undergo an operation. In the end, the fashion show took place more or less smoothly, with only minor problems. Beat also invited Mei to put on the wedding dress intended for his mother and walk with him on the runway. The crowd roared their approval, and the participants finally realized that they have the potential to excel, if given the chance. Kirara's operation was also a huge success.

Along the way, Buchan deals with personal difficulties of his own including a heart attack suffered in 2009. It includes real-life footage of Buchan leading one such Conference. The story then shifts to three interwoven stories, based on real characters and real events. These include Lucky Nzimande , a criminal who unwittingly attempts to hijack what turns out to be two policemen on their way to the Mighty Men's Conference. After his gun fails to fire on Lucky, one of the policemen takes this as a sign from God that he is meant to take the man to the conference with them. André Cloete  is an alcoholic young adult who is self-destructing quickly due in part to his emotionally absent but strictly religious father, and John Peters , is a middle-aged panel beater and biker whose life is falling apart around him due to his heavy drinking after the death of his son and to his deep debts after having stood surety for a biker friend, Danny Boy . These three men and their friends and associates all make their way to a Mighty Men's Conference where their lives are changed forever after hearing Angus Buchan's preaching.{{cite web}}

They stop in Kiev, Ukraine, to visit Chris's brother, Paul , before heading on to Moscow where Chris intends to propose to Natalie. After a night on the town, Paul suggests that they go on an ""extreme tour"" of the abandoned town of Prypiat which sits in the shadow of Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, site of the infamous disaster, since the city is only 100 km from Kiev. They are joined by a backpacking couple, Norwegian Zoe  and Australian Michael ([[Nathan Phillips . The group arrives at the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone checkpoint, in which they are banned by the Ukrainian military but their tour guide, Yuri , takes them in through an unmanned, forested checkpoint, entering the Zone. On the way they stop at a river where they discover a large, mutated fish with large teeth dead at the side of the river. As the group returns to the van, a number of similar fish are seen below the murky water attacking a piece of beef jerky Yuri threw earlier on. They spend a few hours exploring the abandoned city, which was home to Chernobyl workers and their families before they were forced to evacuate overnight. When Yuri takes them into an apartment building they see a dead dog at the entrance. Yuri takes them to the upper floors and shows them the Chernobyl arc reactor no.4. While the group takes pictures, Yuri goes to the adjacent room where he finds something on the floor which he hides from the group. Just as they are about to leave, Yuri hears a noise. When he slowly goes to investigate, a bear comes out from an adjacent room and runs away. Frightened, the group leaves the building. Yuri comments on the incident, telling the group he has been coming to Chernobyl for five years and has always seen a dog or wolves but never a bear. As the group prepares to leave, Yuri finds the wires in his van have been chewed through and tries to radio for help to no avail. As night falls, the group begins arguing and affixing blame. Noises are heard outside and Yuri goes out with a flashlight and a gun, accompanied by Chris. Shots are heard and Paul runs out to investigate, only to return with Chris whose leg has been severely mauled, seemingly by dogs. The dogs proceed to attack the van after which the light in the van goes out. The group is forced to tend to Chris's leg with only the illumination of a cell phone light. The next morning, Paul, Michael, and Amanda go out looking for Yuri who, according to Chris, was taken by ""them"". They follow a trail of blood to find Yuri's mutilated body in an underground complex. They take his gun and Geiger counter and barely escape a pack of mutant creatures. They return to the van, planning to hike to the nearest checkpoint. While the group argues about who stays behind with Chris, Amanda checks the camera. She finds a creature in the picture of an apartment building she took earlier in the day. After much arguing Chris and Natalie stay behind while the others go to get help. Paul gives Natalie the gun and a radio just in case they don't come back. The group starts walking along a road until they see a couple of dogs up ahead feeding on something and they make the decision to go through the woods. The group comes across abandoned vehicles in a parking lot and find a bus with bullet holes that appear to have been shot from the inside. In the bus they find broken guns, a bloody guard uniform, and a flash light. Michael finds replacement wires for the van and Paul contacts Chris and Natalie via radio. The dogs come to attack them again, but the group manages to lose them. While crossing a lake, Michael falls in and is attacked by fish in the water, with the attack severely damaging his leg. Night falls and the group is walking on a road with the help of a flashlight. Amanda tells the others about the picture from the camera, and then a figure is seen running behind them in the dark. They reach the van and find it ripped apart and flipped over. Natalie's video camera reveals she and Chris were taken by the mutants. They go in search of the two but end up being chased by more mutants. During their escape they find a traumatized Natalie and rescue her. When the group is out in the open, they begin to work out where another checkpoint nearby is by using a map Michael obtained during their previous escape. The group is distracted by a little girl in the distance. As they try to communicate with her, Natalie is once again taken by the mutants. Paul, Michael, Amanda, and Zoe attempt to find her, but in the process are swarmed by a horde of mutants. They retreat to a fallout shelter, but Michael is captured. The three continue on, finding Chris' engagement ring for Natalie but no sign of Chris himself. They are again attacked by mutants and, as they begin to climb a ladder leading to the way out, a gang of mutants pull Zoe back down, forcing Amanda and Paul to leave her as they escape. Paul and Amanda continue on through the fallout shelter which comes out in the Chernobyl power plant itself. As they navigate the reactor, Paul finds radiation levels are very high and their skin begins to blister. They continue on and find Natalie's body. They manage to find their way out of the reactor, only to be confronted by Ukrainian military personnel. Blinded from radiation poisoning, Paul is shot dead when he approaches the soldiers. Amanda passes out and awakens on a gurney where several doctors, clad in protective hazmat suits, inform her that she is in a hospital. The doctors talk amongst themselves and reveal that the ""creatures"" were escaped patients that have been recaptured and, since the other Americans are dead, they decide Amanda, having seen the escapees, must not be allowed to leave. She is later thrown into a dark isolated room. Amanda is immediately alerted as she begins to hear noises. She calls out and a group of mutants attack her."

As she is on the road, Skye receives a call from her estranged sister, Alex Bell, who Skye has not spoken to since the past two years. Alex is surprised that Skye wasn't going to tell her that she was leaving. She begs Skye to come see her at her grandparent's country house to say goodbye before she leaves. Initially, Skye refuses, but is convinced by Sienna to tie up all loose ends before moving on with her life. Upon arriving back in Mill Basin, Skye and Sienna are greeted by a 20-something year old Nathan , who shows them the way to Alex's after getting lost. At the house, Nathan is asked to immediately leave the estate by two of Alex's guests: Leo, Alex's love interest, and Nico, who is ready to have fun no matter what. Sienna leaves Skye to make sure Nathan is okay. Skye goes inside to find Alex. After they greet Alex reveals that today is actually her ""Sweet 16"". Stunned and confused at Alex's actions, Skye almost leaves the party but decides to stay for a while longer when Alex becomes worried when she hears Nathan came along with them and unknowingly reveals her location to him. She then meets Ami, Alex's friend who tells Skye to lose the drama. Alex tells Skye in private that she wanted her over because it is a special day for her, and Skye is the only one who could ever understand what it is like to live with the stigma from being Charlie Rotter's daughter. Brynn, a spoiled girl and Nico's girlfriend walks in on the two and is annoyed. As day turns into night, Alex tells Skye of how she met Nathan at Zoe's funeral. He later became obsessed with her, and is willing to do anything for her love and admiration. Nico, Leo, Ami and Brynn tell their perspective of Nathan as ""South Basin trash"". Sienna comes in to tell Skye that Nathan must have ditched the place. After trying talking to Skye, she is forced to wait outside on the top of her car so that Alex can get more bonding time with Skye before they leave. Brynn is outside in the back trying to make a call. When Nathan startles her, Brynn tells him that Alex will never love a freak like him. Nathan, with a knife, chases her. He then strikes a lamp post to her skull. Then her body lands in the pool. At this time, Nico looks around one of the rooms in the house. Nathan threatens Nico with the use of speakers installed in the room and has the doors electronically locked on him. Nico shoots the door with a shotgun causing everyone to worry. He unlocks the door only to find a bloody piece of clothing of Brynn's and shows it to the others. Brynn, who crawled out the pool with her brain severely damaged, walks around the house aimlessly till she crashes on a pool table, and throws up blood on Ami then dies from her wound. Everyone goes inside the room only to have all the doors and windows locked by Nathan, who has complete control over the house as he watches them from one of many cameras installed in the house. A door near Ami opens and she runs for escape but before Skye and the others could get out, the door locks behind Ami. As she calls the cops, the police think she is making a prank call. She trips and her phone falls underneath a table. While trying to reach it the police knock on the front door. When she opens the door the cop is revealed to be Nathan. He shoots her with a nail gun. In shock she runs off but is locked out of the living room where Skye, Alex, Nico and Leo are. Nathan then continues to shoot her with nails, pinning her against the door. Meanwhile, Leo has unlocked another door upstairs. Alex and him run off for escape, leaving Skye and Nico to hunt them down. Skye gets separated from Nico when she heads into the theater room where she finds a mask resembling the one her father used. Nathan walks in and has a film playing of all the events from Skye and Alex's life. He reveals that he has known about Charlie for a long time and admires his doings. Skye calls her father sick for the things he has done. But Nathan says to her that her father was genius for murdering spoiled teenagers. She is sickened and is stalled as Nathan locks her in. Meanwhile Alex and Leo reunite and find themselves being stalked by someone in the dark. Leo points a gun in that direction and before he shoots Alex pulls a knife out and slits his throat. Alex holds the knife close in defense as she sees a man in a mask walking out from the darkness to her, who we know is Nathan. He pulls off the mask to her. Then he pulls her in and begins to romantically make out with her. As their lips part, Alex smiles. It is now revealed that Skye's little sister is the mastermind behind the horrors. Later Nico, who is upstairs, jumps out of an opened window with a knife in hand. When he falls he is wounded by his own knife as Nathan comes out and has him murdered. Sienna, who is now frustrated from waiting waiting to long, finds Nathan hiding Nico's body. She gets help from him to start her car up, which has died out on her. As he has her checking under the hood, he continually slams the roof on her till she isn't moving any more than says this has nothing to do with her. Skye, who has managed to escape, has found a scythe in another room. She hears Alex scream and sees her crying over Leo's dead body. Skye tries to comfort her, but Alex whose face is hidden from her, turns from sad to disgust at the mere touch of her sister. Nathan shows up and becomes unconscious as Alex from behind gags her. Skye, who is tied to a chair, wakes up to the view of a dinner table. The other seats are occupied with the bloody corpses of Brynn, Ami, Leo and Nico. Alex is on the lap of Nathan, kissing him. Skye asks what she is doing. Alex happily replies that she is celebrating her birthday. Alex then changes drastically and admits she is hurting on the inside, suffering from the death of her parents and blames her for leading Charlie to their demise. She then claims that no one would believe Alex as the killer as she just lost her parents and has great recommendations from her therapist, whom Alex had been playing the whole time. Alex and Nathan go back to making out until Skye starts talking and plays on Nathan's emotions. She tells him that he should feel proud for succeeding in the event of getting both of the Rotter daughters in one room. She also tells him that Charlie never knew Alex had existed and would always want Skye to be protected. Unable to deny the facts he unties her. After doing so, Alex grabs the scythe and slits his chest open and charges for Skye. They duke it out and run outside.

As she is on the road, Skye receives a call from her estranged sister, Alex Bell, who Skye has not spoken to since the past two years. Alex is surprised that Skye wasn't going to tell her that she was leaving. She begs Skye to come see her at her grandparent's country house to say goodbye before she leaves. Initially, Skye refuses, but is convinced by Sienna to tie up all loose ends before moving on with her life. Upon arriving back in Mill Basin, Skye and Sienna are greeted by a 20-something year old Nathan , who shows them the way to Alex's after getting lost. At the house, Nathan is asked to immediately leave the estate by two of Alex's guests: Leo, Alex's love interest, and Nico, who is ready to have fun no matter what. Sienna leaves Skye to make sure Nathan is okay. Skye goes inside to find Alex. After they greet Alex reveals that today is actually her ""Sweet 16"". Stunned and confused at Alex's actions, Skye almost leaves the party but decides to stay for a while longer when Alex becomes worried when she hears Nathan came along with them and unknowingly reveals her location to him. She then meets Ami, Alex's friend who tells Skye to lose the drama. Alex tells Skye in private that she wanted her over because it is a special day for her, and Skye is the only one who could ever understand what it is like to live with the stigma from being Charlie Rotter's daughter. Brynn, a spoiled girl and Nico's girlfriend walks in on the two and is annoyed. As day turns into night, Alex tells Skye of how she met Nathan at Zoe's funeral. He later became obsessed with her, and is willing to do anything for her love and admiration. Nico, Leo, Ami and Brynn tell their perspective of Nathan as ""South Basin trash"". Sienna comes in to tell Skye that Nathan must have ditched the place. After trying talking to Skye, she is forced to wait outside on the top of her car so that Alex can get more bonding time with Skye before they leave. Brynn is outside in the back trying to make a call. When Nathan startles her, Brynn tells him that Alex will never love a freak like him. Nathan, with a knife, chases her. He then strikes a lamp post to her skull. Then her body lands in the pool. At this time, Nico looks around one of the rooms in the house. Nathan threatens Nico with the use of speakers installed in the room and has the doors electronically locked on him. Nico shoots the door with a shotgun causing everyone to worry. He unlocks the door only to find a bloody piece of clothing of Brynn's and shows it to the others. Brynn, who crawled out the pool with her brain severely damaged, walks around the house aimlessly till she crashes on a pool table, and throws up blood on Ami then dies from her wound. Everyone goes inside the room only to have all the doors and windows locked by Nathan, who has complete control over the house as he watches them from one of many cameras installed in the house. A door near Ami opens and she runs for escape but before Skye and the others could get out, the door locks behind Ami. As she calls the cops, the police think she is making a prank call. She trips and her phone falls underneath a table. While trying to reach it the police knock on the front door. When she opens the door the cop is revealed to be Nathan. He shoots her with a nail gun. In shock she runs off but is locked out of the living room where Skye, Alex, Nico and Leo are. Nathan then continues to shoot her with nails, pinning her against the door. Meanwhile, Leo has unlocked another door upstairs. Alex and him run off for escape, leaving Skye and Nico to hunt them down. Skye gets separated from Nico when she heads into the theater room where she finds a mask resembling the one her father used. Nathan walks in and has a film playing of all the events from Skye and Alex's life. He reveals that he has known about Charlie for a long time and admires his doings. Skye calls her father sick for the things he has done. But Nathan says to her that her father was genius for murdering spoiled teenagers. She is sickened and is stalled as Nathan locks her in. Meanwhile Alex and Leo reunite and find themselves being stalked by someone in the dark. Leo points a gun in that direction and before he shoots Alex pulls a knife out and slits his throat. Alex holds the knife close in defense as she sees a man in a mask walking out from the darkness to her, who we know is Nathan. He pulls off the mask to her. Then he pulls her in and begins to romantically make out with her. As their lips part, Alex smiles. It is now revealed that Skye's little sister is the mastermind behind the horrors. Later Nico, who is upstairs, jumps out of an opened window with a knife in hand. When he falls he is wounded by his own knife as Nathan comes out and has him murdered. Sienna, who is now frustrated from waiting waiting to long, finds Nathan hiding Nico's body. She gets help from him to start her car up, which has died out on her. As he has her checking under the hood, he continually slams the roof on her till she isn't moving any more than says this has nothing to do with her. Skye, who has managed to escape, has found a scythe in another room. She hears Alex scream and sees her crying over Leo's dead body. Skye tries to comfort her, but Alex whose face is hidden from her, turns from sad to disgust at the mere touch of her sister. Nathan shows up and becomes unconscious as Alex from behind gags her. Skye, who is tied to a chair, wakes up to the view of a dinner table. The other seats are occupied with the bloody corpses of Brynn, Ami, Leo and Nico. Alex is on the lap of Nathan, kissing him. Skye asks what she is doing. Alex happily replies that she is celebrating her birthday. Alex then changes drastically and admits she is hurting on the inside, suffering from the death of her parents and blames her for leading Charlie to their demise. She then claims that no one would believe Alex as the killer as she just lost her parents and has great recommendations from her therapist, whom Alex had been playing the whole time. Alex and Nathan go back to making out until Skye starts talking and plays on Nathan's emotions. She tells him that he should feel proud for succeeding in the event of getting both of the Rotter daughters in one room. She also tells him that Charlie never knew Alex had existed and would always want Skye to be protected. Unable to deny the facts he unties her. After doing so, Alex grabs the scythe and slits his chest open and charges for Skye. They duke it out and run outside. After seeing an unconscious Sienna who has made it to the gates, Skye is chased by Alex in her brand new car, and they head into a wooded area. They fight it out till Skye uses pepper spray on Alex's face and gets up and grabs the scythe Alex carried with her. Alex taunts Skye to kill her, telling her she's just like their father.

Skye finds that Sienna stumbling around, and is in desperate need for hospital attention. Skye sees that a police car has actually reacted to the call made earlier and drives around to check if things are well at the Bell estate. Skye is unable to get their attention in the foggy rain. Skye finds a flare in the trunk of Alex's nearby car and uses it. That still doesn't get their attention. So she then slams the stick where the gas goes and runs for cover and shields Sienna. Skye walks off, victoriously as the police have stopped to rescue them. Time has passed since the party and Skye is now looking through a window where she sees Alex at a mental institution.

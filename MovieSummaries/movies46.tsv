It takes place 17 years after Bilbo Baggins's 111th birthday party and just before Frodo Baggins leaves the Shire for Rivendell . The wizard Gandalf fears that Gollum may reveal information about the One Ring to the Dark Lord Sauron, and sends the Ranger Aragorn, heir of Isildur, on a quest to find him. The story opens with a brief prologue about the ring's disappearance before cutting to Aragorn  and Gandalf  at an inn  in Bree. Gandalf explains his concerns about Gollum's knowledge of the Ring falling into enemy hands, and asks Aragorn to find the creature with his tracking skills. After initially having little luck, Aragorn crosses paths with a fellow ranger and distant kinsman named Arithir , a Ranger of the North, who reports hearing rumours about a creature that has been stealing fish from open windows in local villages; the movie cuts to a scene of Gollum doing just that, and eating his ill-gotten gain atop the roof. Aragorn and Arithir part ways, and Aragorn encounters and kills a pair of Orc scouts in the forest. He soon locates Gollum by a fish pond afterwards and captures the creature in a snare trap. Having secured the whining and protesting Gollum inside a sack, Aragorn sets out for Mirkwood. He briefly spots a Nazgûl in the woods, but avoids it. Later that same day, he is attacked by an Orc squad and defeats them, but is hit by a poison dart which takes effect after he dispatches his last attacker. He collapses beside a patch of Athelas flowers and has a vision of Arwen  in Rivendell. Aragorn regains consciousness at dusk and discovers that Gollum has escaped from the sack. He seeks the creature well into the night, but finally finds him hiding up in a tree. Gollum fearfully explains that a Nazgûl is coming&nbsp;— seconds later, a Ringwraith attacks Aragorn. After a short duel, the Nazgûl flees from a bright light created by the Elves of Mirkwood, who recapture Gollum and guide Aragorn back to their fortress. The scene cuts to Gandalf emerging from Mirkwood's dungeons after interrogating Gollum. Gandalf tells Aragorn that Gollum knows of Bilbo Baggins and The Shire, and explains that he must now go there to warn Frodo. Aragorn suggests sending Frodo to meet him in Bree, and Gandalf readily agrees. The film ends with Gollum speaking to himself in the dungeon, where he vows to kill ""Bagginses"" and reclaim his ""Precious""."

Seven years later, Gekko is promoting his new book Is Greed Good?, while his estranged daughter, Winnie , runs a small news website and is dating Jacob Moore , a top proprietary trader at Keller Zabel Investments . Jacob is a protégé of managing director Louis Zabel , and is trying to raise money for a fusion research project. After Keller Zabel's stock loses more than 30% of its value, Zabel tries to arrange a bailout for KZI from other Wall Street banks but is blocked by Bretton James , head of rival firm Churchill Schwartz, which Zabel had refused to bail out eight years earlier. The next morning Zabel kills himself by jumping in front of a subway train. Distraught, Moore proposes marriage to Winnie, who accepts. Later, he approaches Gekko after a lecture. Gekko tells Jacob that his daughter refuses to speak to him and that Keller Zabel's collapse started when rumours of the company having toxic debt started to spread. Jacob and Gekko arrange a trade: Jacob will reconcile Winnie and Gekko, while Gekko will gather information to destroy Bretton. Aided by Gekko, Moore learns that Bretton James profited from the Keller Zabel collapse. In revenge, he spreads rumors about the nationalization of an African oil field owned by Churchill Schwartz. The company loses $120 million, and Bretton offers Moore a job, which he accepts determined to avenge Zabel. At his new job, Moore convinces Chinese investors to fund the fusion research he has been supporting. Bretton is impressed by Jacob's initiative and is also glad for the new investment. As the economy starts to crumble, Winnie announces to Moore she is pregnant, and Bretton reveals to Moore that the Chinese investment is going into bunk solar panels and fossil fuels instead of fusion research, which upsets Moore. Gekko proposes a solution, using a $100 million trust fund account in Switzerland, which Gekko set up for Winnie in the 1980s, to fund the research and save the company. She signs the money over to Moore who then entrusts it to Gekko to legitimize the funds for investment in the fusion research company. However, the money never arrives, and Gekko leaves the country with the money. Jacob realizes that Gekko has been using him to get the money in the account for his own gain. Distraught, Jacob confesses to Winnie that he had been secretly meeting with Gekko. Winnie then asks Jacob to leave as she neither trusts him nor feels safe around him. Moore tracks Gekko to London where he is running a start-up financial company with the $100 million. Jacob proposes one last trade: Winnie gets her money back, and Gekko gets a grandson, but Gekko refuses. Moore pieces together everything from Keller Zabel's collapse to the economic bailout of Bretton's company and gives the information to Winnie telling her that revealing it will bring her website publicity and credibility. Winnie runs the story, and Bretton James is exposed. The investors leave Bretton and go to Gekko on the back of his $1.1 billion return as Bretton finds himself under intense legal scrutiny by the government. As Jacob finds Winnie in New York, Gekko appears and tells them that he deposited $100 million into the fusion research's account anonymously. He apologizes to Jacob and Winnie, who then reconcile. One year later, Gekko is seen at his grandson's first birthday.

Activist filmmaker Philippe Diaz examines the history and impact of economic inequality in the third world in The End of Poverty?, and makes the compelling argument that it's not an accident or simple bad luck that has created a growing underclass around the world. Diaz traces the growth of global poverty back to colonization in the 15th century, and features interviews with a number of economists, sociologists, and historians who explain how poverty is the clear consequence of free-market economic policies that allow powerful nations to exploit poorer countries for their assets and keep money in the hands of the wealthy rather than distributing it more equitably to the people who have helped them gain their fortunes. Diaz also explores how wealthy nations  seize a disproportionate share of the world's natural resources, and how this imbalance is having a dire impact on the environment as well as the economy."

Samson sniffs petrol every morning. He lives in a run-down shelter with his brother's band playing reggae music, all day, right outside his bedroom. Samson is interested in Delilah, who lives with her grandmother. He throws a rock at her outside the local convenience store. In spite of mocking encouragement from her grandmother Delilah is initially not interested in him. Samson spends a day following Delilah around. He attempts to move in with Delilah, even though she is clearly uninterested in him. Delilah's grandmother passes away. Samson in a fit of rage, beats his brother with a stick, in order to shut him and his band up. His brother retaliates. The same thing is happening to Delilah; the other old women in the community blame her 'neglect' for her grandmother's death and beat her with sticks. Samson steals a car and takes Delilah with him as she sleeps. When they arrive in Alice Springs, they find a homeless man, Gonzo, living under a bridge. Samson continues to rely on petrol sniffing, and his habit progressively worsens. At one point, he gets so high from the fumes that he does not notice when Delilah is taken by a group of white teenagers in a car. She is raped and bashed, but she eventually comes back to Samson, who is unconscious on the floor due to the petrol sniffing. She also begins sniffing petrol with Samson. Under the same circumstances as her abduction, they are both walking along the street and Delilah is hit by a car.

Carmen  is a fatally attractive coquette living in the poor quarters, and working in a cigarette factory. One day, she plays a practical joke on one of her co-workers. The girl can't appreciate this and starts a fight; to which Carmen responds by stabbing her with a knife. Stationed in the factory, Jozef is ordered to hold Carmen. While being guarded, Carmen successfully seduces Jozef and convinces him to undo her from her handcuffs: ""For Carmen's heart was fickle. Her passions wild and bold. Proud of every conquest. And fond of foolish gold."" She gratefully thanks him and then escapes through the window. While she joins her confederates - a group of bandits - Jozef feels guilty not for having released her, but for having fallen in love with her. He is arrested for having helped a fugitive, and is imprisoned. One day, Jozef receives a letter from Carmen: ""Come to me Jozef, and I shall show you the way to freedom, where none shall be afraid of their past – no loss or trouble to either of us again."" He is able to distract his guards and flees to the bar where Carmen is staying. He feels guilty for kissing her, but then starts a fight with another man who seduces her. Afterward, the guards arrive at the bar to search for Jozef, and he is convinced by Carmen to join her as a fugitive. They become part of an organised crime, which includes Carmen entertaining a group of soldiers, while the other men, among them Jozef, get the stuff over the border. Meanwhile, Mareike has left her home to search for Jozef on the cold streets. She is satisfied to find him, but Jozef orders her to leave. He then returns to Carmen, and demands that she will never love another man. Carmen, aware that she can't live up to Jozef's expectations, finds refuge in a bar. Jozef follows her and blames her for having ruined his life. He then leaves, as he realizes that his love for Carmen is gone. The same night, Carmen falls for Dalboni , a celebrated baritone. She seduces him, and he in turn is impressed with her. Several nights later, Dalboni reads from The Bohemian Girl. Carmen, realizing that she has fallen in love with Dalboni, writes to Jozef that she no longer can see him. A year later, she is a happily married woman living in extreme wealth, while Jozef wanders through the streets. At the premiere of an opera, Dalboni is praised by the audience, and he calls Carmen his inspiration. ""But the shadow returned again. The man forsaken came out of her past."" Jozef finds Carmen backstage and confronts her with all that she has caused in his life. When he asks her if she still loves him, she responds by describing her love for Dalboni: ""He is everything to me. Now, at last, I know what real love is. I shall live for him alone."" In a rage, Jozef condemns Carmen and stabs her to death."

Carmen  is a fatally attractive coquette living in the poor quarters, and working in a cigarette factory. One day, she plays a practical joke on one of her co-workers. The girl can't appreciate this and starts a fight; to which Carmen responds by stabbing her with a knife. Stationed in the factory, Jozef is ordered to hold Carmen.

Starting to believe it to be true, he wakes up his employer, a bear named Oliver. When Oliver tries to convince Yost that dragons do not exist. Yost tries to convince Oliver otherwise by showing him a book he'd been reading during the storm. Oliver takes the book and reads a Dragon Calling spell from it and the wind blows the curtains in their faces, and they do not notice as a dragon walks by the window. After the storm dies down, they see dragon tracks on the ground, and Yost goes searching for more evidence, Visiting Oliver's Next Door Neighbor Kit Cat. He tells Kit Cat about what had happened with her determining that if she were a dragon after having laid an Egg, she'd leave on the back path behind the gardens. In the middle of the forest, Yost insisted they look around to find something to convince Oliver that Dragons are real and find a spherical object. Not knowing what it is, they take it back to Oliver, who assumes that it is a beach ball. Meanwhile in a local bar, some gangsters are plotting a heist at a banquet to be held in Oliver's mansion. One of the gangsters has been hired as a doorman. The next morning, while Oliver is cleaning up for his party, the ""beach ball"" follows him, eventually carrying him outside to the fountain in front of his home. At this point, a dragon hatches out of the ""beach ball"" and he starts acting affectionate with Oliver, proving that Yost and Kit cat were right, as Kit Cat points out that the little Dragon believes Oliver to be his father, since oliver was the first thing the little dragon saw. Oliver names the dragon Dexter, after his great Grandfather. A rumor quickly spreads through town that Oliver laid an egg, after the Local Grocer bringing an order to the Marquee explained he was late because he'd witnessed Oliver hatching an egg with a creature in it. The size and shape kept changing each time that the story gets retold from the Mayor's office to the newspaper making its way to the entire town. Later that day, Yost and a duck he had hired to be waiter for Oliver's Party attempt to give Dexter a bath, but as Kit Cat had read earlier, that dragons hated Baths; Dexter reacts by growing very large and becoming aggressive. When Yost tries to explain this to Oliver, he goes upstairs to investigate himself. By the time that he reaches the bathroom, Dexter has returned to normal size, Oliver interprets it to mean that Yost and the duck overreacted, leading Oliver to still believe that Dexter is still a harmless child. Before the banquet starts, Oliver puts Dexter to bed, but Dexter doesn't immediately go to sleep and starts gathering up toys and anything else he could fit in his pillow case presumably starting a hoard. During the banquet, the gangsters are surreptitiously stealing the guests' belongings, While Dexter is slowly making his way towards the party attracted by the music and food. Meanwhile Kit Cat is reading that dragons can be set off by sweet-tasting foods and Shiny objects, and she realizes that Dexter might try to get into the party. She goes to the party and tries to get Oliver's attention, but he ignores her and opens the curtain to the dining room, revealing the monstrous Dexter, who assaults the guests collecting and shaking out what the gangsters couldn't steal. Kit Cat tells Oliver he needed to be firm with Dexter, and Oliver not believing the monstrous dragon was Dexter, until he scolded him and Dexter returns to normal size. Oliver in obvious denial of Dexter obviously being a Dragon, he tries convincing his guests that Dexter's still a child but very different and special in his own right and that he was only going through growing. One of Oliver's guests the Local physician tells Oliver to bring Dexter in for a checkup to help deal with the ""growing Pains"". Before he leaves for the hospital the Police chief is there to make sure Dexter and Oliver goes, and Kit Cat insists that she go with them to make sure nothing happens, with Oliver scolding her and insisting it was still nothing to worry over. When Oliver brings Dexter into the hospital the next morning, the gangsters kidnap Dexter and have him rob the bank for them. When Oliver arrives to stop Dexter, the giant Dexter grabs him and runs into the hills with him. Oliver wakes up the next morning, alone in a cave, finding himself to be alone until Kit Cat comes to try to convince Oliver to send Dexter back to his own Kind, over the Misty Mountains but Oliver continuing to be stubborn, motivated Dexter to chasing Kit Cat away. Dexter is scolded for it afterward by Oliver who suggests to have breakfast. Dexter opens his bag and dumps out some turnips he'd dug up, but oliver not liking the idea of eating them, Dexter leaves. After wandering through the hills for a few minutes trying to find Dexter, he starts remembering how good he had it back home and eventually comes across the police, who arrest him for his presumed role in the bank robbery. Dexter returns apparently after having raided the Grocer's store for food he knew Oliver liked, but finds Oliver gone and starts crying. After The Mayor makes a deal with Oliver to capture Dexter and hand him over to the Circus, under the premise that it's for Dexter's own good, Oliver cooperates. As Dexter Breaks into the jail trying to save Oliver, Oliver tells Dexter he can't be the little dragon's father anymore which saddens Dexter causing him to shrink down to the size he was when he hatched, leaving the jail crying. Oliver gets out of jail and is returned home commended for helping to ""Capture the vicious Dragon"" and watches as a Commercial for the circus with the Gangsters hosting comes on TV. Yost leaves for the opening premier of the Circus leaving Kit Cat to watch it over the TV and her shouting at Oliver to be quiet. Only to later see Oliver unpacking a Blunderbuss that he brings with him going to the Circus. At the start of the show Kit Cat can be seen sneaking to the back of the tent opening the cage Dexter was kept in trying to help him escape, only to find the Dragon was too sad and depressed to want to escape. Later One of the Gangsters and the Duck show up to get Dexter into the show pushing, shoving and pulling him into the Center ring with the Lead Gangster making himself the Ring Master trying to provoke him by whipping the ground in front of him. Oliver arrives at the circus and stops the act, Bringing up Dexter's Spirits after seeing him. Oliver stirs up some trouble by firing his Blunderbuss into the air scaring the crowd. This causes Dexter to grow and Become aggressive again. The resulting chaos destroys the Circus with the Gangsters trying to get away with all the money, but Dexter stops them first by picking them up, only to have Oliver tell him to put the Money box down. This causes some of the money they'd had to fly away on a breeze, Dexter sees it and Burns it leaving the gangsters with nothing, he Picks up Oliver and leaves for the hills again only unlike before Oliver gives a warmer farewell telling Dexter he was a Big boy and had to return to his Dragon kind over the mountains. Dexter hears a call from another Dragon and climbs the hills returning it, waving goodbye to Oliver. At the end of the Movie, Oliver admits his Faults, Misjudgments and stubbornness by admitting that dragons were in fact real and he'd learned this from a book Yost had that Yost claimed he lost. but instead we see Yost burning it with Oliver seeing him, With the Mayor, Newspaper editor and other friends at the Table, Oliver toasts to Dexter and the Dragons, after which we hear a Dragon Call scaring Yost, thinking another one was coming, but Oliver believed it was Dexter Saying another goodbye to them all from the mountain, Confident that he'd found his family. The movie ends with the Duck waddling up to the mountain with a Net and Cage, apparently hoping to catch a Dragon of his own."

Oliver wakes up the next morning, alone in a cave, finding himself to be alone until Kit Cat comes to try to convince Oliver to send Dexter back to his own Kind, over the Misty Mountains but Oliver continuing to be stubborn, motivated Dexter to chasing Kit Cat away. Dexter is scolded for it afterward by Oliver who suggests to have breakfast. Dexter opens his bag and dumps out some turnips he'd dug up, but oliver not liking the idea of eating them, Dexter leaves. After wandering through the hills for a few minutes trying to find Dexter, he starts remembering how good he had it back home and eventually comes across the police, who arrest him for his presumed role in the bank robbery. Dexter returns apparently after having raided the Grocer's store for food he knew Oliver liked, but finds Oliver gone and starts crying. After The Mayor makes a deal with Oliver to capture Dexter and hand him over to the Circus, under the premise that it's for Dexter's own good, Oliver cooperates. As Dexter Breaks into the jail trying to save Oliver, Oliver tells Dexter he can't be the little dragon's father anymore which saddens Dexter causing him to shrink down to the size he was when he hatched, leaving the jail crying. Oliver gets out of jail and is returned home commended for helping to ""Capture the vicious Dragon"" and watches as a Commercial for the circus with the Gangsters hosting comes on TV. Yost leaves for the opening premier of the Circus leaving Kit Cat to watch it over the TV and her shouting at Oliver to be quiet. Only to later see Oliver unpacking a Blunderbuss that he brings with him going to the Circus. At the start of the show Kit Cat can be seen sneaking to the back of the tent opening the cage Dexter was kept in trying to help him escape, only to find the Dragon was too sad and depressed to want to escape. Later One of the Gangsters and the Duck show up to get Dexter into the show pushing, shoving and pulling him into the Center ring with the Lead Gangster making himself the Ring Master trying to provoke him by whipping the ground in front of him. Oliver arrives at the circus and stops the act, Bringing up Dexter's Spirits after seeing him. Oliver stirs up some trouble by firing his Blunderbuss into the air scaring the crowd. This causes Dexter to grow and Become aggressive again. The resulting chaos destroys the Circus with the Gangsters trying to get away with all the money, but Dexter stops them first by picking them up, only to have Oliver tell him to put the Money box down. This causes some of the money they'd had to fly away on a breeze, Dexter sees it and Burns it leaving the gangsters with nothing, he Picks up Oliver and leaves for the hills again only unlike before Oliver gives a warmer farewell telling Dexter he was a Big boy and had to return to his Dragon kind over the mountains. Dexter hears a call from another Dragon and climbs the hills returning it, waving goodbye to Oliver. At the end of the Movie, Oliver admits his Faults, Misjudgments and stubbornness by admitting that dragons were in fact real and he'd learned this from a book Yost had that Yost claimed he lost. but instead we see Yost burning it with Oliver seeing him, With the Mayor, Newspaper editor and other friends at the Table, Oliver toasts to Dexter and the Dragons, after which we hear a Dragon Call scaring Yost, thinking another one was coming, but Oliver believed it was Dexter Saying another goodbye to them all from the mountain, Confident that he'd found his family. The movie ends with the Duck waddling up to the mountain with a Net and Cage, apparently hoping to catch a Dragon of his own."

Starting to believe it to be true, he wakes up his employer, a bear named Oliver. When Oliver tries to convince Yost that dragons do not exist. Yost tries to convince Oliver otherwise by showing him a book he'd been reading during the storm. Oliver takes the book and reads a Dragon Calling spell from it and the wind blows the curtains in their faces, and they do not notice as a dragon walks by the window. After the storm dies down, they see dragon tracks on the ground, and Yost goes searching for more evidence, Visiting Oliver's Next Door Neighbor Kit Cat. He tells Kit Cat about what had happened with her determining that if she were a dragon after having laid an Egg, she'd leave on the back path behind the gardens. In the middle of the forest, Yost insisted they look around to find something to convince Oliver that Dragons are real and find a spherical object. Not knowing what it is, they take it back to Oliver, who assumes that it is a beach ball. Meanwhile in a local bar, some gangsters are plotting a heist at a banquet to be held in Oliver's mansion. One of the gangsters has been hired as a doorman. The next morning, while Oliver is cleaning up for his party, the ""beach ball"" follows him, eventually carrying him outside to the fountain in front of his home. At this point, a dragon hatches out of the ""beach ball"" and he starts acting affectionate with Oliver, proving that Yost and Kit cat were right, as Kit Cat points out that the little Dragon believes Oliver to be his father, since oliver was the first thing the little dragon saw. Oliver names the dragon Dexter, after his great Grandfather. A rumor quickly spreads through town that Oliver laid an egg, after the Local Grocer bringing an order to the Marquee explained he was late because he'd witnessed Oliver hatching an egg with a creature in it. The size and shape kept changing each time that the story gets retold from the Mayor's office to the newspaper making its way to the entire town. Later that day, Yost and a duck he had hired to be waiter for Oliver's Party attempt to give Dexter a bath, but as Kit Cat had read earlier, that dragons hated Baths; Dexter reacts by growing very large and becoming aggressive. When Yost tries to explain this to Oliver, he goes upstairs to investigate himself. By the time that he reaches the bathroom, Dexter has returned to normal size, Oliver interprets it to mean that Yost and the duck overreacted, leading Oliver to still believe that Dexter is still a harmless child. Before the banquet starts, Oliver puts Dexter to bed, but Dexter doesn't immediately go to sleep and starts gathering up toys and anything else he could fit in his pillow case presumably starting a hoard. During the banquet, the gangsters are surreptitiously stealing the guests' belongings, While Dexter is slowly making his way towards the party attracted by the music and food. Meanwhile Kit Cat is reading that dragons can be set off by sweet-tasting foods and Shiny objects, and she realizes that Dexter might try to get into the party. She goes to the party and tries to get Oliver's attention, but he ignores her and opens the curtain to the dining room, revealing the monstrous Dexter, who assaults the guests collecting and shaking out what the gangsters couldn't steal. Kit Cat tells Oliver he needed to be firm with Dexter, and Oliver not believing the monstrous dragon was Dexter, until he scolded him and Dexter returns to normal size. Oliver in obvious denial of Dexter obviously being a Dragon, he tries convincing his guests that Dexter's still a child but very different and special in his own right and that he was only going through growing. One of Oliver's guests the Local physician tells Oliver to bring Dexter in for a checkup to help deal with the ""growing Pains"".

Starting to believe it to be true, he wakes up his employer, a bear named Oliver. When Oliver tries to convince Yost that dragons do not exist. Yost tries to convince Oliver otherwise by showing him a book he'd been reading during the storm. Oliver takes the book and reads a Dragon Calling spell from it and the wind blows the curtains in their faces, and they do not notice as a dragon walks by the window. After the storm dies down, they see dragon tracks on the ground, and Yost goes searching for more evidence, Visiting Oliver's Next Door Neighbor Kit Cat. He tells Kit Cat about what had happened with her determining that if she were a dragon after having laid an Egg, she'd leave on the back path behind the gardens. In the middle of the forest, Yost insisted they look around to find something to convince Oliver that Dragons are real and find a spherical object. Not knowing what it is, they take it back to Oliver, who assumes that it is a beach ball. Meanwhile in a local bar, some gangsters are plotting a heist at a banquet to be held in Oliver's mansion. One of the gangsters has been hired as a doorman. The next morning, while Oliver is cleaning up for his party, the ""beach ball"" follows him, eventually carrying him outside to the fountain in front of his home. At this point, a dragon hatches out of the ""beach ball"" and he starts acting affectionate with Oliver, proving that Yost and Kit cat were right, as Kit Cat points out that the little Dragon believes Oliver to be his father, since oliver was the first thing the little dragon saw. Oliver names the dragon Dexter, after his great Grandfather. A rumor quickly spreads through town that Oliver laid an egg, after the Local Grocer bringing an order to the Marquee explained he was late because he'd witnessed Oliver hatching an egg with a creature in it. The size and shape kept changing each time that the story gets retold from the Mayor's office to the newspaper making its way to the entire town. Later that day, Yost and a duck he had hired to be waiter for Oliver's Party attempt to give Dexter a bath, but as Kit Cat had read earlier, that dragons hated Baths; Dexter reacts by growing very large and becoming aggressive. When Yost tries to explain this to Oliver, he goes upstairs to investigate himself. By the time that he reaches the bathroom, Dexter has returned to normal size, Oliver interprets it to mean that Yost and the duck overreacted, leading Oliver to still believe that Dexter is still a harmless child. Before the banquet starts, Oliver puts Dexter to bed, but Dexter doesn't immediately go to sleep and starts gathering up toys and anything else he could fit in his pillow case presumably starting a hoard. During the banquet, the gangsters are surreptitiously stealing the guests' belongings, While Dexter is slowly making his way towards the party attracted by the music and food. Meanwhile Kit Cat is reading that dragons can be set off by sweet-tasting foods and Shiny objects, and she realizes that Dexter might try to get into the party. She goes to the party and tries to get Oliver's attention, but he ignores her and opens the curtain to the dining room, revealing the monstrous Dexter, who assaults the guests collecting and shaking out what the gangsters couldn't steal. Kit Cat tells Oliver he needed to be firm with Dexter, and Oliver not believing the monstrous dragon was Dexter, until he scolded him and Dexter returns to normal size. Oliver in obvious denial of Dexter obviously being a Dragon, he tries convincing his guests that Dexter's still a child but very different and special in his own right and that he was only going through growing. One of Oliver's guests the Local physician tells Oliver to bring Dexter in for a checkup to help deal with the ""growing Pains"". Before he leaves for the hospital the Police chief is there to make sure Dexter and Oliver goes, and Kit Cat insists that she go with them to make sure nothing happens, with Oliver scolding her and insisting it was still nothing to worry over. When Oliver brings Dexter into the hospital the next morning, the gangsters kidnap Dexter and have him rob the bank for them. When Oliver arrives to stop Dexter, the giant Dexter grabs him and runs into the hills with him. Oliver wakes up the next morning, alone in a cave, finding himself to be alone until Kit Cat comes to try to convince Oliver to send Dexter back to his own Kind, over the Misty Mountains but Oliver continuing to be stubborn, motivated Dexter to chasing Kit Cat away. Dexter is scolded for it afterward by Oliver who suggests to have breakfast. Dexter opens his bag and dumps out some turnips he'd dug up, but oliver not liking the idea of eating them, Dexter leaves. After wandering through the hills for a few minutes trying to find Dexter, he starts remembering how good he had it back home and eventually comes across the police, who arrest him for his presumed role in the bank robbery. Dexter returns apparently after having raided the Grocer's store for food he knew Oliver liked, but finds Oliver gone and starts crying. After The Mayor makes a deal with Oliver to capture Dexter and hand him over to the Circus, under the premise that it's for Dexter's own good, Oliver cooperates. As Dexter Breaks into the jail trying to save Oliver, Oliver tells Dexter he can't be the little dragon's father anymore which saddens Dexter causing him to shrink down to the size he was when he hatched, leaving the jail crying. Oliver gets out of jail and is returned home commended for helping to ""Capture the vicious Dragon"" and watches as a Commercial for the circus with the Gangsters hosting comes on TV. Yost leaves for the opening premier of the Circus leaving Kit Cat to watch it over the TV and her shouting at Oliver to be quiet. Only to later see Oliver unpacking a Blunderbuss that he brings with him going to the Circus. At the start of the show Kit Cat can be seen sneaking to the back of the tent opening the cage Dexter was kept in trying to help him escape, only to find the Dragon was too sad and depressed to want to escape. Later One of the Gangsters and the Duck show up to get Dexter into the show pushing, shoving and pulling him into the Center ring with the Lead Gangster making himself the Ring Master trying to provoke him by whipping the ground in front of him. Oliver arrives at the circus and stops the act, Bringing up Dexter's Spirits after seeing him. Oliver stirs up some trouble by firing his Blunderbuss into the air scaring the crowd. This causes Dexter to grow and Become aggressive again. The resulting chaos destroys the Circus with the Gangsters trying to get away with all the money, but Dexter stops them first by picking them up, only to have Oliver tell him to put the Money box down. This causes some of the money they'd had to fly away on a breeze, Dexter sees it and Burns it leaving the gangsters with nothing, he Picks up Oliver and leaves for the hills again only unlike before Oliver gives a warmer farewell telling Dexter he was a Big boy and had to return to his Dragon kind over the mountains. Dexter hears a call from another Dragon and climbs the hills returning it, waving goodbye to Oliver.

Before the banquet starts, Oliver puts Dexter to bed, but Dexter doesn't immediately go to sleep and starts gathering up toys and anything else he could fit in his pillow case presumably starting a hoard. During the banquet, the gangsters are surreptitiously stealing the guests' belongings, While Dexter is slowly making his way towards the party attracted by the music and food. Meanwhile Kit Cat is reading that dragons can be set off by sweet-tasting foods and Shiny objects, and she realizes that Dexter might try to get into the party. She goes to the party and tries to get Oliver's attention, but he ignores her and opens the curtain to the dining room, revealing the monstrous Dexter, who assaults the guests collecting and shaking out what the gangsters couldn't steal. Kit Cat tells Oliver he needed to be firm with Dexter, and Oliver not believing the monstrous dragon was Dexter, until he scolded him and Dexter returns to normal size. Oliver in obvious denial of Dexter obviously being a Dragon, he tries convincing his guests that Dexter's still a child but very different and special in his own right and that he was only going through growing. One of Oliver's guests the Local physician tells Oliver to bring Dexter in for a checkup to help deal with the ""growing Pains"". Before he leaves for the hospital the Police chief is there to make sure Dexter and Oliver goes, and Kit Cat insists that she go with them to make sure nothing happens, with Oliver scolding her and insisting it was still nothing to worry over. When Oliver brings Dexter into the hospital the next morning, the gangsters kidnap Dexter and have him rob the bank for them. When Oliver arrives to stop Dexter, the giant Dexter grabs him and runs into the hills with him. Oliver wakes up the next morning, alone in a cave, finding himself to be alone until Kit Cat comes to try to convince Oliver to send Dexter back to his own Kind, over the Misty Mountains but Oliver continuing to be stubborn, motivated Dexter to chasing Kit Cat away. Dexter is scolded for it afterward by Oliver who suggests to have breakfast. Dexter opens his bag and dumps out some turnips he'd dug up, but oliver not liking the idea of eating them, Dexter leaves. After wandering through the hills for a few minutes trying to find Dexter, he starts remembering how good he had it back home and eventually comes across the police, who arrest him for his presumed role in the bank robbery. Dexter returns apparently after having raided the Grocer's store for food he knew Oliver liked, but finds Oliver gone and starts crying. After The Mayor makes a deal with Oliver to capture Dexter and hand him over to the Circus, under the premise that it's for Dexter's own good, Oliver cooperates. As Dexter Breaks into the jail trying to save Oliver, Oliver tells Dexter he can't be the little dragon's father anymore which saddens Dexter causing him to shrink down to the size he was when he hatched, leaving the jail crying. Oliver gets out of jail and is returned home commended for helping to ""Capture the vicious Dragon"" and watches as a Commercial for the circus with the Gangsters hosting comes on TV. Yost leaves for the opening premier of the Circus leaving Kit Cat to watch it over the TV and her shouting at Oliver to be quiet. Only to later see Oliver unpacking a Blunderbuss that he brings with him going to the Circus. At the start of the show Kit Cat can be seen sneaking to the back of the tent opening the cage Dexter was kept in trying to help him escape, only to find the Dragon was too sad and depressed to want to escape. Later One of the Gangsters and the Duck show up to get Dexter into the show pushing, shoving and pulling him into the Center ring with the Lead Gangster making himself the Ring Master trying to provoke him by whipping the ground in front of him. Oliver arrives at the circus and stops the act, Bringing up Dexter's Spirits after seeing him. Oliver stirs up some trouble by firing his Blunderbuss into the air scaring the crowd. This causes Dexter to grow and Become aggressive again. The resulting chaos destroys the Circus with the Gangsters trying to get away with all the money, but Dexter stops them first by picking them up, only to have Oliver tell him to put the Money box down. This causes some of the money they'd had to fly away on a breeze, Dexter sees it and Burns it leaving the gangsters with nothing, he Picks up Oliver and leaves for the hills again only unlike before Oliver gives a warmer farewell telling Dexter he was a Big boy and had to return to his Dragon kind over the mountains. Dexter hears a call from another Dragon and climbs the hills returning it, waving goodbye to Oliver. At the end of the Movie, Oliver admits his Faults, Misjudgments and stubbornness by admitting that dragons were in fact real and he'd learned this from a book Yost had that Yost claimed he lost. but instead we see Yost burning it with Oliver seeing him, With the Mayor, Newspaper editor and other friends at the Table, Oliver toasts to Dexter and the Dragons, after which we hear a Dragon Call scaring Yost, thinking another one was coming, but Oliver believed it was Dexter Saying another goodbye to them all from the mountain, Confident that he'd found his family. The movie ends with the Duck waddling up to the mountain with a Net and Cage, apparently hoping to catch a Dragon of his own."

Starting to believe it to be true, he wakes up his employer, a bear named Oliver. When Oliver tries to convince Yost that dragons do not exist. Yost tries to convince Oliver otherwise by showing him a book he'd been reading during the storm. Oliver takes the book and reads a Dragon Calling spell from it and the wind blows the curtains in their faces, and they do not notice as a dragon walks by the window. After the storm dies down, they see dragon tracks on the ground, and Yost goes searching for more evidence, Visiting Oliver's Next Door Neighbor Kit Cat. He tells Kit Cat about what had happened with her determining that if she were a dragon after having laid an Egg, she'd leave on the back path behind the gardens. In the middle of the forest, Yost insisted they look around to find something to convince Oliver that Dragons are real and find a spherical object. Not knowing what it is, they take it back to Oliver, who assumes that it is a beach ball. Meanwhile in a local bar, some gangsters are plotting a heist at a banquet to be held in Oliver's mansion. One of the gangsters has been hired as a doorman. The next morning, while Oliver is cleaning up for his party, the ""beach ball"" follows him, eventually carrying him outside to the fountain in front of his home. At this point, a dragon hatches out of the ""beach ball"" and he starts acting affectionate with Oliver, proving that Yost and Kit cat were right, as Kit Cat points out that the little Dragon believes Oliver to be his father, since oliver was the first thing the little dragon saw. Oliver names the dragon Dexter, after his great Grandfather. A rumor quickly spreads through town that Oliver laid an egg, after the Local Grocer bringing an order to the Marquee explained he was late because he'd witnessed Oliver hatching an egg with a creature in it. The size and shape kept changing each time that the story gets retold from the Mayor's office to the newspaper making its way to the entire town. Later that day, Yost and a duck he had hired to be waiter for Oliver's Party attempt to give Dexter a bath, but as Kit Cat had read earlier, that dragons hated Baths; Dexter reacts by growing very large and becoming aggressive.

Starting to believe it to be true, he wakes up his employer, a bear named Oliver. When Oliver tries to convince Yost that dragons do not exist. Yost tries to convince Oliver otherwise by showing him a book he'd been reading during the storm. Oliver takes the book and reads a Dragon Calling spell from it and the wind blows the curtains in their faces, and they do not notice as a dragon walks by the window. After the storm dies down, they see dragon tracks on the ground, and Yost goes searching for more evidence, Visiting Oliver's Next Door Neighbor Kit Cat. He tells Kit Cat about what had happened with her determining that if she were a dragon after having laid an Egg, she'd leave on the back path behind the gardens. In the middle of the forest, Yost insisted they look around to find something to convince Oliver that Dragons are real and find a spherical object. Not knowing what it is, they take it back to Oliver, who assumes that it is a beach ball. Meanwhile in a local bar, some gangsters are plotting a heist at a banquet to be held in Oliver's mansion. One of the gangsters has been hired as a doorman. The next morning, while Oliver is cleaning up for his party, the ""beach ball"" follows him, eventually carrying him outside to the fountain in front of his home. At this point, a dragon hatches out of the ""beach ball"" and he starts acting affectionate with Oliver, proving that Yost and Kit cat were right, as Kit Cat points out that the little Dragon believes Oliver to be his father, since oliver was the first thing the little dragon saw. Oliver names the dragon Dexter, after his great Grandfather. A rumor quickly spreads through town that Oliver laid an egg, after the Local Grocer bringing an order to the Marquee explained he was late because he'd witnessed Oliver hatching an egg with a creature in it. The size and shape kept changing each time that the story gets retold from the Mayor's office to the newspaper making its way to the entire town. Later that day, Yost and a duck he had hired to be waiter for Oliver's Party attempt to give Dexter a bath, but as Kit Cat had read earlier, that dragons hated Baths; Dexter reacts by growing very large and becoming aggressive. When Yost tries to explain this to Oliver, he goes upstairs to investigate himself. By the time that he reaches the bathroom, Dexter has returned to normal size, Oliver interprets it to mean that Yost and the duck overreacted, leading Oliver to still believe that Dexter is still a harmless child. Before the banquet starts, Oliver puts Dexter to bed, but Dexter doesn't immediately go to sleep and starts gathering up toys and anything else he could fit in his pillow case presumably starting a hoard. During the banquet, the gangsters are surreptitiously stealing the guests' belongings, While Dexter is slowly making his way towards the party attracted by the music and food. Meanwhile Kit Cat is reading that dragons can be set off by sweet-tasting foods and Shiny objects, and she realizes that Dexter might try to get into the party. She goes to the party and tries to get Oliver's attention, but he ignores her and opens the curtain to the dining room, revealing the monstrous Dexter, who assaults the guests collecting and shaking out what the gangsters couldn't steal. Kit Cat tells Oliver he needed to be firm with Dexter, and Oliver not believing the monstrous dragon was Dexter, until he scolded him and Dexter returns to normal size. Oliver in obvious denial of Dexter obviously being a Dragon, he tries convincing his guests that Dexter's still a child but very different and special in his own right and that he was only going through growing. One of Oliver's guests the Local physician tells Oliver to bring Dexter in for a checkup to help deal with the ""growing Pains"". Before he leaves for the hospital the Police chief is there to make sure Dexter and Oliver goes, and Kit Cat insists that she go with them to make sure nothing happens, with Oliver scolding her and insisting it was still nothing to worry over. When Oliver brings Dexter into the hospital the next morning, the gangsters kidnap Dexter and have him rob the bank for them. When Oliver arrives to stop Dexter, the giant Dexter grabs him and runs into the hills with him. Oliver wakes up the next morning, alone in a cave, finding himself to be alone until Kit Cat comes to try to convince Oliver to send Dexter back to his own Kind, over the Misty Mountains but Oliver continuing to be stubborn, motivated Dexter to chasing Kit Cat away. Dexter is scolded for it afterward by Oliver who suggests to have breakfast. Dexter opens his bag and dumps out some turnips he'd dug up, but oliver not liking the idea of eating them, Dexter leaves. After wandering through the hills for a few minutes trying to find Dexter, he starts remembering how good he had it back home and eventually comes across the police, who arrest him for his presumed role in the bank robbery. Dexter returns apparently after having raided the Grocer's store for food he knew Oliver liked, but finds Oliver gone and starts crying. After The Mayor makes a deal with Oliver to capture Dexter and hand him over to the Circus, under the premise that it's for Dexter's own good, Oliver cooperates. As Dexter Breaks into the jail trying to save Oliver, Oliver tells Dexter he can't be the little dragon's father anymore which saddens Dexter causing him to shrink down to the size he was when he hatched, leaving the jail crying. Oliver gets out of jail and is returned home commended for helping to ""Capture the vicious Dragon"" and watches as a Commercial for the circus with the Gangsters hosting comes on TV.

Not knowing what it is, they take it back to Oliver, who assumes that it is a beach ball. Meanwhile in a local bar, some gangsters are plotting a heist at a banquet to be held in Oliver's mansion. One of the gangsters has been hired as a doorman. The next morning, while Oliver is cleaning up for his party, the ""beach ball"" follows him, eventually carrying him outside to the fountain in front of his home. At this point, a dragon hatches out of the ""beach ball"" and he starts acting affectionate with Oliver, proving that Yost and Kit cat were right, as Kit Cat points out that the little Dragon believes Oliver to be his father, since oliver was the first thing the little dragon saw. Oliver names the dragon Dexter, after his great Grandfather. A rumor quickly spreads through town that Oliver laid an egg, after the Local Grocer bringing an order to the Marquee explained he was late because he'd witnessed Oliver hatching an egg with a creature in it. The size and shape kept changing each time that the story gets retold from the Mayor's office to the newspaper making its way to the entire town. Later that day, Yost and a duck he had hired to be waiter for Oliver's Party attempt to give Dexter a bath, but as Kit Cat had read earlier, that dragons hated Baths; Dexter reacts by growing very large and becoming aggressive. When Yost tries to explain this to Oliver, he goes upstairs to investigate himself. By the time that he reaches the bathroom, Dexter has returned to normal size, Oliver interprets it to mean that Yost and the duck overreacted, leading Oliver to still believe that Dexter is still a harmless child. Before the banquet starts, Oliver puts Dexter to bed, but Dexter doesn't immediately go to sleep and starts gathering up toys and anything else he could fit in his pillow case presumably starting a hoard. During the banquet, the gangsters are surreptitiously stealing the guests' belongings, While Dexter is slowly making his way towards the party attracted by the music and food. Meanwhile Kit Cat is reading that dragons can be set off by sweet-tasting foods and Shiny objects, and she realizes that Dexter might try to get into the party. She goes to the party and tries to get Oliver's attention, but he ignores her and opens the curtain to the dining room, revealing the monstrous Dexter, who assaults the guests collecting and shaking out what the gangsters couldn't steal. Kit Cat tells Oliver he needed to be firm with Dexter, and Oliver not believing the monstrous dragon was Dexter, until he scolded him and Dexter returns to normal size. Oliver in obvious denial of Dexter obviously being a Dragon, he tries convincing his guests that Dexter's still a child but very different and special in his own right and that he was only going through growing. One of Oliver's guests the Local physician tells Oliver to bring Dexter in for a checkup to help deal with the ""growing Pains"". Before he leaves for the hospital the Police chief is there to make sure Dexter and Oliver goes, and Kit Cat insists that she go with them to make sure nothing happens, with Oliver scolding her and insisting it was still nothing to worry over. When Oliver brings Dexter into the hospital the next morning, the gangsters kidnap Dexter and have him rob the bank for them. When Oliver arrives to stop Dexter, the giant Dexter grabs him and runs into the hills with him. Oliver wakes up the next morning, alone in a cave, finding himself to be alone until Kit Cat comes to try to convince Oliver to send Dexter back to his own Kind, over the Misty Mountains but Oliver continuing to be stubborn, motivated Dexter to chasing Kit Cat away. Dexter is scolded for it afterward by Oliver who suggests to have breakfast. Dexter opens his bag and dumps out some turnips he'd dug up, but oliver not liking the idea of eating them, Dexter leaves. After wandering through the hills for a few minutes trying to find Dexter, he starts remembering how good he had it back home and eventually comes across the police, who arrest him for his presumed role in the bank robbery. Dexter returns apparently after having raided the Grocer's store for food he knew Oliver liked, but finds Oliver gone and starts crying. After The Mayor makes a deal with Oliver to capture Dexter and hand him over to the Circus, under the premise that it's for Dexter's own good, Oliver cooperates. As Dexter Breaks into the jail trying to save Oliver, Oliver tells Dexter he can't be the little dragon's father anymore which saddens Dexter causing him to shrink down to the size he was when he hatched, leaving the jail crying. Oliver gets out of jail and is returned home commended for helping to ""Capture the vicious Dragon"" and watches as a Commercial for the circus with the Gangsters hosting comes on TV. Yost leaves for the opening premier of the Circus leaving Kit Cat to watch it over the TV and her shouting at Oliver to be quiet. Only to later see Oliver unpacking a Blunderbuss that he brings with him going to the Circus. At the start of the show Kit Cat can be seen sneaking to the back of the tent opening the cage Dexter was kept in trying to help him escape, only to find the Dragon was too sad and depressed to want to escape. Later One of the Gangsters and the Duck show up to get Dexter into the show pushing, shoving and pulling him into the Center ring with the Lead Gangster making himself the Ring Master trying to provoke him by whipping the ground in front of him. Oliver arrives at the circus and stops the act, Bringing up Dexter's Spirits after seeing him. Oliver stirs up some trouble by firing his Blunderbuss into the air scaring the crowd. This causes Dexter to grow and Become aggressive again. The resulting chaos destroys the Circus with the Gangsters trying to get away with all the money, but Dexter stops them first by picking them up, only to have Oliver tell him to put the Money box down. This causes some of the money they'd had to fly away on a breeze, Dexter sees it and Burns it leaving the gangsters with nothing, he Picks up Oliver and leaves for the hills again only unlike before Oliver gives a warmer farewell telling Dexter he was a Big boy and had to return to his Dragon kind over the mountains. Dexter hears a call from another Dragon and climbs the hills returning it, waving goodbye to Oliver. At the end of the Movie, Oliver admits his Faults, Misjudgments and stubbornness by admitting that dragons were in fact real and he'd learned this from a book Yost had that Yost claimed he lost. but instead we see Yost burning it with Oliver seeing him, With the Mayor, Newspaper editor and other friends at the Table, Oliver toasts to Dexter and the Dragons, after which we hear a Dragon Call scaring Yost, thinking another one was coming, but Oliver believed it was Dexter Saying another goodbye to them all from the mountain, Confident that he'd found his family. The movie ends with the Duck waddling up to the mountain with a Net and Cage, apparently hoping to catch a Dragon of his own."

His offense: Introducing to his students the concept that man descended from the apes, a theory of the naturalist Charles Darwin, though vigorously renounced by town leaders such as the Rev. Jeremiah Brown. The town is excited because appearing on behalf of the prosecution will be the famous Matthew Harrison Brady, a noted statesman and failed presidential candidate. A staunch foe of Darwinism and a Biblical scholar, Brady will sit beside his hand-picked prosecuting attorney, Davenport, in the courtroom of Judge Coffey to teach the naive teacher Cates the error of his ways. A surprise is in store for Brady, however. The teacher's defense is to be handled by the equally well-known Henry Drummond, one of America's most controversial legal minds and a long-standing acquaintance and adversary of Brady. An influential newspaperman, E.K. Hornbeck of the Baltimore Herald, has personally seen to it that Drummond will come to town to represent the teacher in this case, and that his newspaper and a radio network will provide nationwide coverage of what began as a minor legal matter. Rev. Brown rails against the defendant publicly, rallying the townspeople against Cates and his godless attorney. The preacher's daughter Rachel is conflicted because Cates is the love of her life. The judge clearly admires Brady, even addressing him as ""Colonel"" in court. Drummond objects to this, so, as a compromise, the judge reluctantly makes him a ""temporary"" colonel just for these proceedings. But each time Drummond attempts to call a scientist or authority figure to discuss Darwin's theories, the judge sustains the prosecution's objections and forbids such opinions to be heard. His hands tied in every other way, Drummond has no other choice but to put Brady himself on the witness stand. Brady's confidence in his Biblical knowledge is so great that he welcomes this challenge, but he becomes flustered under Drummond's cross-examination, unable to explain certain apparent contradictions, until Drummond hammers home his point&nbsp;&ndash; that Cates, like any other man, demands the right to think for himself. Cates is ultimately found guilty, to the gallery's relief, but because Drummond has made his case so convincingly with the trial becoming a political embarrassment, the judge sees fit to do no more than make him pay a very small fine. Brady is furious at this and tries to enter a lengthy speech into the record, but Drummond persuades the Judge to disallow it since the trial has concluded. As the court is adjourned, Brady tries to give his speech but most ignore him outside of his wife and his court opponents who are concerned seeing him become hysterical. During this fit he suffers a ruptured stomach and dies in the court room. Later, after the crowd has cleared out, Hornbeck is talking with Drummond and wants to use the Bible quotation from a religious rally held by Rev Brown and in which Brady had quoted the ""inherit the wind"" verse because Brown was about to damn his own daughter, but cannot remember it. Drummond, without looking up, quotes the verse verbatim, which shocks Hornbeck. He and Drummond argue over Brady and Hornbeck walks out, leaving Drummond alone in the courtroom to pack. Drummond picks up a Bible and Darwin's book, balancing them in his hands as if he was a scale. Then he puts the two together and slides them into his briefcase. The final scene shows Drummond walking out of the court room alone with the song ""Give that Old Time Religion"" being sung as it was in the opening of the movie."

Rick and Donnie win the first five nine holes, with Ted and Cam getting frustrated. Near the end of the round, Cam tells Ted how he can't afford the $2500 they bet on the game, so ted tells Rick they want to press, so they would play another 18 holes for $5000.

The scenery is the Tuscan countryside, in 1984. As the train is late, the two decide to go for an alternative path and take a road through the fields. Shortly afterwards, the car gets stuck, and as the night approaches, it starts to rain. The two men manage to find shelter under a huge tree, but it is late, and there seems to be no hope the rain might stop before the night is over. While having a chat, they spot a light through the rain that turns out to be that of a small inn. Mario and Saverio decide to spend the night there and are hosted in a room along with a third man, who is already sleeping as they come in. The morning after, the two wake up to see the man urinate onto the street from the window. The laughters are stopped at once by the sound of a spear hitting him in the chest and killing him. They rush downstairs to see what happened, and find out, in astonishment, that they have travelled back in time to year 1492 and are now in the vicinity of a small town called Frittole. Forced to get in terms with the fact after a first refusal, they make friends with Vitellozzo, brother of the man killed in the inn. He explains them he is in a feud with a gang of men ruled by Giuliano De Capecchio, who are responsible for the death of Vitellozzo's brother and other members of his family. Once in Frittole, Mario and Saverio meet Vitellozzo's mother and try to definitely get used to the idea of being really in 1492. Saverio feels at ease while Mario simply cannot get along with what he is going through and aches to go back to his time. On the very next Sunday, they go to the church and Mario meets Pia, with whom he falls in love. After trying to help Vitellozzo, who has gotten into trouble for attempting an attack against De Capecchio's gang, they decide to finally leave the country, led by Saverio's adventurous spirit. They are now heading towards Spain, intentioned to stop Christopher Columbus and prevent him from discovering the Americas. One day they come across an amazon named Astriaha, who shoots them with her bow, missing the target and hitting their carriage instead. The following morning, after a night spent in another inn, the two encounter again the woman, who points her bow at them once more. Now the movie goes on following two different versions: In the edited version, the amazon faints before them and, although Saverio intends to help her, Mario convinces him they would better run. Thus they begin to travel and end up to meet Leonardo Da Vinci in a campsite. The three have a talk, during which Mario and Saverio try to explain to Leonardo concepts and inventions unknown to the people of the time , which he seems uncapable to understand. They then set off, and once back to the inn they meet again with Astriaha, who explains her duty is that of preventing them to reach Spain and stop Columbus. The two are stunned at the news the navigator might leave within moments and hurry up to the beach intentioned to stop him, but get there too late. While going back, they spot steam coming up from somewhere down a valley and are filled with excitement at the thought they might have come back to their century. In fact, it is just Leonardo Da Vinci, who has in the meantime treasured their teachings and invented the locomotive. The movie ends with the two men giving up to their fate. In the unedited version, the amazon says she has not slept for three days because of them, and that they must get back to their boss, Alonso. They explain the woman they do not know who this Alonso is, at which the woman faints. After having relieved her, Saverio falls in love with the amazon, who is instead caught making love with Mario some time after, at which the two men have an argument and fight, ending up to run after each other and reach the sea shore. Here, they call at the top of their voices the name of Cristopher Columbus, but find out he has already left. The scene on the beach is that in which the two versions finally join.

One day, Mrs. Simmons orders Jack to buy groceries with her last $50 bill she has in her savings, but Jack is distracted by a dirt bike race and uses the $50 to buy a dirt bike from a local bully named Max . When Jack has the bike, he learns it is alive, or possibly occupied by a friendly spirit, and does things to help out Jack. Mrs. Simmons is furious that Jack spent her money on a dirt bike, and promptly confiscates the bike and sells it to a local shop owner Mr. Zak  regaining her $50. However, the bike returns in the middle of the night to visit Jack. Jack tells this to Mr. Zak, who says Jack can work off his debt by having himself and the bike make deliveries for him. Jack also plays on a Little League team sponsored by the Doghouse, a hot dog joint owned by Mike , who was a lifetime friend of Jack's father and is trying to look out for Jack in the wake of his father's death. The Doghouse is experiencing serious financial problems and is being sought to be demolished by the town's banker Mr. Hodgkins  in order to make way for a second Hodgkins Bank. One of his tellers is Mazie Clavell  who is also a coach of the rival Little League team. She later quits when she sees Hodgkins as a ruthless businessman who advocates getting ahead at all costs, and begins dating Mike, whom she sees as an honest business owner who faces adversity squarely. Jack and his friend Pee Wee use the bike to help uncover why Hodgkins is after the Doghouse, especially after hacking into the bank's computer they learn that the Doghouse's land would not make a very good location for Hodgkins' bank and that Mr. Hodgkins' personal account is not as sizable as the community is led to believe. Hodgkins learns of Jack's attempt to save the Doghouse, and enlists the aid of Max  who brings in a biker named Big Slime . When Mr. Hodgkins converses on Jack's house, Mr. Hodgkins calls in Police Chief Salt  of the local force. Chief Salt orders his men to impound the dirt bike as he is overextended on his mortgage at Hodgkins' Bank, and whom Mr. Hodgkins' chooses not to foreclose on Chief Salt in exchange. Mr. Hodgkins states to Jack and his mom that if he wants the dirt bike back, the impoundment fee is $100.000. However, Mazie and Mike come to Jack's aid by paying the impoundment fee for Jack to get his dirt bike back. When the groundbreaking ceremony on the bank's construction is set to begin by having a bulldozer raze the Doghouse, Jack shows up with his Little League team, who disrupts the event by getting into a pie fight with Max, Hodgkins, and Big Slime's bikers. The dirt bike then takes away a shocked Hodgkins' while Jack is driving it. With Hodgkins in tow, Jack says that he is aware of the financial problems of both Hodgkins and Mike, and has an idea where all can benefit.

The enquiry is to determine which members were at fault for the failure of the expedition, meaning that the story is told in flashback as the men remember it. Initially, the soldiers are shown training while a voiceover by expedition leader Lt. Col. Robert Niell  tells us that there will be five British Army soldiers, two Territorial Army soldiers and three Hong Kong Chinese soldiers on the expedition. When the expedition starts, it becomes clear that the level of fitness among its members varies greatly. Lance Corporal Richard Mayfield , who is also the technical advisor on the expedition, expresses serious concern about the group's ability as a whole. Later that night, Niell feels that it is an appropriate time to ""discuss things"". Sergeant Bob Mann  suggests that the fitter members of the team continue on with the expedition as planned while the weaker members climb back down the mountain, drive to a village at the other end of the valley and work their way back up the river as a support group. Niell rejects the plan, leading to a confrontation between him and Mayfield. The next day, Corporal Hugh Brittan , Mayfield, Lance Corporal Steve Page  and Lance Corporal Peter Shearer  make a head start. Brittan, now the most senior of the four soldiers, says that Niell wanted to use the morning as a resting period for the others. By nightfall, only Mann has caught up with the advance party. He explains that the rear party, now consisting of the supposed leaders of the expedition and three inexperienced Chinese soldiers, have already set up camp further down the mountain. Once again, Mayfield expresses serious concern, saying that ""it's taken them fifteen hours to do a journey that took us three and they're still not here."" He also highlighted how the rations had been carefully planned and wouldn't last if there were any more delays. The next morning, Mayfield quickly climbs back down the mountain to where Niell, Major Ron Foster  and the three Chinese soldiers are camped in order to get permission from Niell to abseil into Low's Gully . Niell agrees, but tells him to wait at the bottom. Mayfield protests, saying that he can only wait for a limited time. Exactly what happened in this conversation is left unclear. When Mayfield gets back to the top, Shearer makes it clear that he feels the advance party should wait. As the senior NCO, Brittan decides that if Mayfield wishes to abseil without the rear party, then they shouldn't wait. After abseiling down, the advance party decide not to wait for their own safety and on the assumption that the rear party will not be able to abseil down. Shearer looks up at the cliff face with binoculars and finds the others but it isn't clear if they are moving up or down. Once again, he makes it clear that he wants them to wait but Mayfield claims that they must be going back up while Brittan says that ""if they are coming down, we waste at least two days waiting for them to catch up. If they're going up, we waste if for nothing. I don't think we can take the risk."" Neill and Foster manage to get the Chinese soldiers down and into the gully, but find that the others haven't waited. Brittan leaves them a note saying 'The advance party wishes you a pleasant jorney. Keep smiling!' This angers Neill and Foster. Tensions are also rising in the advance party, especially between Shearer and Brittan. During an abseil, the rope becomes loose, causing Shearer to fall and badly injure his head. Fortunately, his legs aren't broken, meaning he can still walk. Nonetheless, the accident affects his strength and ability to continue. Mann also has an accident; when struggling through the undergrowth, he slips and badly cuts his hand on his machete. The cut becomes infected and starts to smell like ""rotting meat"".

However, Lance Corporal Yiu Keung 'Kevin' Cheung had been secretly conserving food in case of an emergency and gave some to Neill and Fostor.

After Page leaves, Brittan explains to them that Neill had led his party into the gully after all and was now trapped in there. Nobody had raised the alarm however, as nobody knew they missing. Neill hadn't even given a finishing date to the authorities. Brittan remembered that Neill had planned to stay close to the river throughout the expedition and advised the search and rescue teams of this.

Back in the present, Neill openly accuses Brittan and Mayfeild of condemning him to a ""slow death by starvation"". Mayfeild counters this by saying Neill shouldn't have brought along the Chinese soldiers. Brittan stated that he made the right decision but for the wrong reasons: had he waited for them they'd all have become trapped and no one would have looked for them, resulting in all their deaths. However, he didn't know this when he made the decision. The film concludes by stating that Neill and Foster were severely criticised and that their leadership had been ""flawed and over-ambitious"". Meanwhile, Corporal Brittan, Lance Corporal Mayfeild and Lance Corporal Yiu Keung 'Kevin' Cheung all received commendations for their actions during the ordeal."

The enquiry is to determine which members were at fault for the failure of the expedition, meaning that the story is told in flashback as the men remember it. Initially, the soldiers are shown training while a voiceover by expedition leader Lt. Col. Robert Niell  tells us that there will be five British Army soldiers, two Territorial Army soldiers and three Hong Kong Chinese soldiers on the expedition. When the expedition starts, it becomes clear that the level of fitness among its members varies greatly. Lance Corporal Richard Mayfield , who is also the technical advisor on the expedition, expresses serious concern about the group's ability as a whole. Later that night, Niell feels that it is an appropriate time to ""discuss things"". Sergeant Bob Mann  suggests that the fitter members of the team continue on with the expedition as planned while the weaker members climb back down the mountain, drive to a village at the other end of the valley and work their way back up the river as a support group. Niell rejects the plan, leading to a confrontation between him and Mayfield. The next day, Corporal Hugh Brittan , Mayfield, Lance Corporal Steve Page  and Lance Corporal Peter Shearer  make a head start. Brittan, now the most senior of the four soldiers, says that Niell wanted to use the morning as a resting period for the others. By nightfall, only Mann has caught up with the advance party. He explains that the rear party, now consisting of the supposed leaders of the expedition and three inexperienced Chinese soldiers, have already set up camp further down the mountain. Once again, Mayfield expresses serious concern, saying that ""it's taken them fifteen hours to do a journey that took us three and they're still not here."" He also highlighted how the rations had been carefully planned and wouldn't last if there were any more delays. The next morning, Mayfield quickly climbs back down the mountain to where Niell, Major Ron Foster  and the three Chinese soldiers are camped in order to get permission from Niell to abseil into Low's Gully . Niell agrees, but tells him to wait at the bottom. Mayfield protests, saying that he can only wait for a limited time. Exactly what happened in this conversation is left unclear. When Mayfield gets back to the top, Shearer makes it clear that he feels the advance party should wait. As the senior NCO, Brittan decides that if Mayfield wishes to abseil without the rear party, then they shouldn't wait. After abseiling down, the advance party decide not to wait for their own safety and on the assumption that the rear party will not be able to abseil down. Shearer looks up at the cliff face with binoculars and finds the others but it isn't clear if they are moving up or down. Once again, he makes it clear that he wants them to wait but Mayfield claims that they must be going back up while Brittan says that ""if they are coming down, we waste at least two days waiting for them to catch up. If they're going up, we waste if for nothing. I don't think we can take the risk."" Neill and Foster manage to get the Chinese soldiers down and into the gully, but find that the others haven't waited. Brittan leaves them a note saying 'The advance party wishes you a pleasant jorney. Keep smiling!' This angers Neill and Foster. Tensions are also rising in the advance party, especially between Shearer and Brittan. During an abseil, the rope becomes loose, causing Shearer to fall and badly injure his head. Fortunately, his legs aren't broken, meaning he can still walk. Nonetheless, the accident affects his strength and ability to continue. Mann also has an accident; when struggling through the undergrowth, he slips and badly cuts his hand on his machete. The cut becomes infected and starts to smell like ""rotting meat"". All members are becoming psychologically affected by the ordeal, something that isn't aided by the shortage of food. By this point, Neill and his party have realised that they are trapped in the gully without Mayfeild's technical expertise. They cannot continue without him, nor can they climb back up.

Though she repulses his first advance, she does spend an idyllic day with him in the countryside. Karl is called away to duty, however. Colonel Eric von Raden , his uncle and the chief of the secret police, gives him secret plans to deliver to Berlin. He also warns his nephew that the woman is Tania Fedorova, a Russian spy. Tania comes to him aboard the train, professing to love him, but he tells her he knows who she is. Dejected, she leaves. The next morning, when Karl wakes up, he finds the plans have been stolen. As a result, he is sentenced to military degradation and imprisonment for treason. However, Colonel von Raden visits him in prison and arranges for his release. He sends his nephew to Warsaw, posing as a Serbian pianist, to seek out the identity of the real traitor and thus exonerate himself. In Warsaw, by chance, Karl is asked to play at a private party where he once again crosses paths with Tania. She is being escorted by General Boris Alexandroff , the infatuated head of the Russian Military Intelligence Department. Foolhardily, Karl plays a tune from the opera they attended together. She recognizes it, but does not betray him. As the party goers are leaving, she slips away for a few stolen moments with her love. The jealous Alexandroff suspects their feelings for each other. He hires Karl to play the next day at a ball he is giving at his mansion for Tania's birthday. While Alexandroff and Tania are alone in his home office, he receives a parcel containing the latest secrets stolen by the traitor, whom he casually identifies as Max Heinrich. Later, Tania steals the documents, gives them to Karl, and sends him out via a secret passage. However, it is all a trap. Alexandroff comes in and tells Tania that what she stole was mere blank paper; he shows her the real documents. He pulls out a gun and announces that he intends to use it on Karl, who has been captured outside. She struggles with Alexandroff and manages to fatally shoot him; the sound goes unheard amidst the merriment of the party. When the guards bring the prisoner, she pretends the general is still alive and wants to see him alone. She and Karl escape with the incriminating documents and get married.

She bore Mussolini a son, Benito Albino, before the outbreak of World War I. The two lost touch during the war years and, upon discovering him again in a hospital during the war, she also discovered Rachele Guidi, who had married Mussolini in 1915, and a daughter born in 1910 when Guidi and Mussolini were living together. Historically, following his political ascendency, Mussolini suppressed the information about his first marriage and he  persecuted both his first wife and oldest son and committed them forcibly to asylums. Dalser died in an asylum in Venice in 1937 at the age of 57 of brain haemorrhages and Benito Albino died in 1942 at the age of 26 in an asylum near Milan after repeated coma-inducing injections.{{Cite news}}

The light reflected from the stars is the only cure for his fear of the dark. One night this fear leads him to the orphanage rooftop, where he discovers that his favourite star has disappeared. Unfortunately it's not going to be the last one. Tim also discovers a peculiar character that goes by the name of the Cat Shepherd together with his faithful cat Tobermory, the latter to become Tim's personal guardian. The Shepherd is in charge of making children sleep peacefully, but Tim is not about to go to bed. He needs his star more than anything in the world, and will do what it takes to see it shine in the night sky once again. Tim convinces the Shepherd to take him to see Moka, the guardian of the night within the Night World, and pleads for him to return the stars to the night sky. Moka pays scarce attention to the boys pleas, so Tim asks the Cat Shepherd to take him to the Lighthouse of the Stars, where he thinks he may find the answer to the strange phenomena. Tim, the Shepherd, and Tobermory race against the clock through the streets of Nocturna, a world in which hundreds of the most diverse creatures work to create the night as we all know it.

However, his bedroom is too small and his fiancee Betty Dorrick  wants him to settle down. Accordingly, Brose seeks a job in DICE's boiler-room, a suitable environment to grow his mushrooms. The plot describes his attempts to get the job, and the conflicts with middle-management, including the personnel manager, Mrs Murray . Having obtained it, Brose is more interested in his mushrooms than tending the boiler, with unforeseen results including a major power cut. The boiler room contains a computer , which towards the end of the film is also breaking down. Brose eventually marries Betty, but is more interested in having her sweep up the boiler room so he can concentrate on his first love, the mushrooms. Eventually he goes haywire and the film ends with Brose and Betty loading up a pram with mushrooms and escaping.

El , a crew member, walks through the corridors of the ship when he discovers the eponymous magic portal, a rectangular arch flashing with various colors. Entering the portal, he is transported into a world of passageways. Some LEGO creatures appear and build a small car for him to drive through the world of passages. He then has a close encounter with a two-headed monster who chases him through the various paths of the mysterious world. After El's car has a bump from a crossing train, the car falls apart. El finds another portal, and nearly gets eaten by the monster, who ends up in the real world while chasing a leftover tyre from the devoured car and attacks Lindsay Fleay. El reports his experiences to Captain Paranoia, but neither him nor his shipmate Pee believes him. However, Captain Paranoia finds another Portal, which takes him to a ""white expanse"" world, where a plasticine creature messes around with him, making him very annoyed and then flushs him out of the white coloured world. The plasticine creature then goes back through the portal Captain Paranoia came through. The Captain then finds his way back to the ship, and tells El and Pee about what happened in the Portal. El, Pee, Captain Paranoia and the Plasticine creature, go through the Portal, and find themselves in the real world, and get chased by liquid paper daleks. The four escape the liquid paper daleks, which are scared off by the two-headed monster that El had an encounter with earlier, in a shoe car. The monster is in pursuit of the shoe car, causing the car to destroy the set Lindsay Fleay was filming, and the monster knocks over the camera. As the set is rebuilt, El walks through the ship corridors again. The film ends as the screen goes through the Portal."

22727026	/m/05zys3j	The Salt Prince				{}	{}	"{""/m/0hqxf"": ""Family Film"", ""/m/01hmnh"": ""Fantasy""}"	"The film features a narrative set in an alternate reality in which there is no such thing as lying and everything said is the absolute truth. In this world people make blunt, often cruel statements, including those that in our world people would normally keep to themselves. Naturally, there is a lack of religious belief. The absence of fiction results in a movie industry limited to lecture-style historical readings, and advertisements as bluntly truthful as the people are. Mark Bellison  is an unsuccessful lecture-film writer who is assigned to write about the 1300s, a ""very boring"" era. One night he goes out on a date with the beautiful, charming and wealthy Anna McDoogles . She tells Mark she is not attracted to him, due to his looks and unsuccessful financial situation, but is going out with him to satisfy her extremely prejudicial mother and as a favour to Mark's friend Greg Kleinschmidt . The next day Mark is fired from his job due to lack of interest in his films, and his landlord evicts him for not paying his rent. Depressed, he goes to the bank to close his account. The teller informs him that the computers are down, and asks him how much money he has in his account. Mark is about to tell her when a strange reaction occurs in his brain, as he remembers how much money his landlord said he owed . As such, he has an epiphany that enables him to tell the world's first lie, that he has $800 in his account. The computer comes back online and shows his balance is $300 but the teller gives him the full $800 anyway, assuming that the computer made a mistake. Mark then lies in a variety of other circumstances, including telling an attractive woman that the world will end unless they have sex, preventing a police officer  from arresting his friend Greg for DUI, getting money from a casino, and stopping his neighbour Frank Fawcett  from committing suicide. He then writes a screenplay about the world being invaded by aliens in the 14th century and that the memories of all humans were erased. He becomes wealthy from the success of the film which he named ""The Black Plague."" Mark convinces Anna to go out with him again hoping she will see past his looks and weight now that he is financially secure. On their date Anna congratulates Mark for his success and admits that he would be a good husband and father. She is still not attracted to him because if they ever have children Mark would contribute half of the heredity to their children, making them ""fat kids with snub noses"" and Anna does not want that. Mark then gets a call that his mother had a heart attack and rushes to the hospital. There, the doctor  tells him that his mother is going to die. She is terrified of death, believing that death will bring an eternity of nothingness. Mark, through tears, tells her that death instead brings a joyful afterlife, introducing the concept of a Heaven to her, and she dies happy while the doctors and nurses appear awed by what he says. Mark soon receives worldwide attention for his supposed new information about death. Under pressure from Anna, he tells them, through ""ten rules"", he talks to a ""Man In The Sky"" who controls everything and promises great rewards in the good place after you die so long as you do no more than three ""bad things."" Some time later Anna and Mark are hanging out together in a park and Anna asks him if they marry would being rich and famous make their children not fat with snub noses. Mark wants to lie but does not because of his feelings for Anna. Meanwhile Mark's rival Brad Kessler  pursues Anna romantically, motivated because of Mark's success. However Brad's blunt, rude manner makes Anna uncomfortable though she continues dating him; they become engaged. Anna invites Mark to the wedding. Mark tries to convince her to not marry Brad but fails. Anna goes to the park she first went to with Mark and sees a slightly overweight child with an ice cream when some thinner boys come and mush his ice cream into his shirt. She yells at them and then they run away. She runs up to the boy and wipes away his tears while asking his name. He replies 'Short Fat Brian' to which she tells him: 'you are so much more than just that.' Before the wedding Mark's friend Greg shows up and tells him that he did not lose her yet and Mark reluctantly attends Anna and Brad's wedding. There, he objects to the marriage, but the officiant informs him that only the Man in the Sky can stop the wedding. Brad and Anna both ask Mark to ask the Man in the Sky what Anna should do but Mark refuses to say anything and leaves, wanting Anna to choose for herself. Anna walks out and Mark confesses his ability to lie and that the Man In The Sky he told everyone about was made up. Anna struggles to comprehend the concept and asks why he did not lie to convince her to marry him; Mark states that it ""wouldn't count."" Anna confesses that she loves him. Some time later, the now-pregnant Anna and Mark are shown married with a son, who is implied to have his father's ability to lie."

Every time he is placed in a new home, he runs away. His friend's father, whose couch Mike had been sleeping on, asks Burt Cotton ([[Ray McKinnon , the coach of Wingate Christian school, to help enroll his son and Mike. Impressed by Mike's size and athleticism, Cotton gets him admitted despite his abysmal academic record. At his new school, Michael is befriended by a boy named Sean Jr. ""SJ"" . SJ's mother Leigh Anne Tuohy  is a strong-minded interior designer and the wife of wealthy businessman Sean Tuohy . Leigh Anne notices Michael walking on the road, shivering in the cold; when she learns he intends to spend the night huddled outside the school gym, she offers him a place to sleep at her house. The next morning, when she sees Michael leaving, she asks him to spend the Thanksgiving holiday with her family. Slowly, Michael becomes a member of the Tuohy family, even as Leigh Anne's rich friends wonder what she is doing. One even suggests that her teenage daughter Collins  is not safe around him, much to Leigh Anne's disgust. When Leigh Anne seeks to become Michael's legal guardian, she learns he was separated from his drug-addict mother when he was seven and that no one knows her whereabouts. She is also told that even though he scored low in almost every category in a career aptitude test, he is in the 98th percentile in ""protective instincts"". After his grades improve, Michael is allowed to join the school football team. He has a shaky start due to his polite and gentle nature, yet after some encouragement by Leigh Anne to tap into his ""protective instincts"" and regard his teammates as he would members of his family, Michael dominates on the field. SJ sends out videos of the games to college coaches around the country. Leigh Anne discovers that to get a NCAA Division I scholarship, Michael needs a 2.5 GPA, so they hire a tutor, Miss Sue . Some of the teachers help out as well, and Michael ends up with a GPA of 2.52. When coaches come to recruit Michael, Leigh Anne makes it clear that she prefers the University of Mississippi  as both she and her husband are alumni. Miss Sue, another Ole Miss alumna, tells Michael  that the FBI buries body parts under the University of Tennessee's Neyland Stadium for research; Leigh Anne particularly loathes that school. Michael commits to Ole Miss. Subsequently, Michael and the Tuohys become the subject of an NCAA investigation. The investigator tells Michael that the Tuohys and Miss Sue are fervent Mississippi boosters, who are subject to special restrictions, and his high school coach got a job at Ole Miss after Michael chose the school. Michael confronts Leigh Anne, asking her if she only took him in so he would play football for her alma mater. Michael then goes to his birth mother's apartment in the projects. His old friends welcome him, but their leader makes crude remarks about Leigh Anne and Collins. Michael becomes angry and in the ensuing fight subdues his former friends and then flees. Leigh Anne searches for Michael. He finally calls her, and they meet. Leigh Anne tells him she will support any decision he makes. Michael satisfies the investigator by explaining that he chose Ole Miss because his whole family has gone there. Later, Leigh Anne and her family take Michael to the Ole Miss campus to begin college. The film ends with an emotional goodbye between Leigh Anne and Michael. The closing credits show the 2009 NFL Draft with the real Michael Oher being drafted by the Baltimore Ravens in the first round. Photographs of Oher and the real Tuohys follow, with Oher's success in the NFL detailed. The credits include a dedication to director John Lee Hancock's father, a football player and coach who died in 2009."

Since the increasing population of the Hebrews threatened the Egyptians, the pharaoh handed down an edict sentencing all newborn Hebrew sons to death. The baby Moses, born of Yokebed and Amram, was set adrift on the Nile in a basket, so that his life might be saved. He was found by the daughter of Seti, the childless Princess Bithia, who believed Moses was sent to her by the gods. The Royal Palace: Moses was adopted by Seti and raised in the pharaoh’s court as a brother to the young prince, Ramses. When the brothers grew to young men, Seti announced that Ramses would become the next pharaoh. Moses would be his second in command, the architect of his cities, and his lifetime chief counselor. Both brothers fervently wished to marry the young princess, Nefertari. Ramses’ position as pharaoh forced Nefertari to take him and give up her secret hope of being with Moses, the only man she ever loved. Outside the Palace Walls & Across the Desert: As time passed, Moses began to question the enslavement of the Hebrews. After witnessing an Egyptian guard abusing a Hebrew, Moses became enraged at the injustices the slaves were suffering, and impulsively killed the guard. During his murder trial, Moses’ real sister Miriam revealed to Moses that he was actually the son of Yokebed, a Hebrew slave. Moses was banished to the desert and fled to Midian, where he met and married Zipporah, the daughter of the Midianite priest. On the Mountain of Horeb: One day in the wilderness, Moses saw a bush that was burning but was not consumed by the flames. From it came the voice of God, instructing him to return to Egypt and demand that Ramses free the Hebrew slaves. Moses, armed only with his shepherd’s staff but inspired by the power of God, undertook the mission to lead the Hebrews to “a promised land, a land overflowing with milk and honey.” Moses returned to Egypt to confront the pharaoh. The Treasure Cities of Ramses: Back in Egypt, the brutality of Ramses’ treatment of the slaves only strengthened Moses' resolve. Ramses was overjoyed at the return of his brother until Moses told him that he must let the Hebrews go, explaining to him that no man has the right to enslave another man. Enraged by Moses’ plea, Ramses threatened to kill the slaves. In response, Moses unleashed ten plagues on the Kingdom of the Pharaoh; the last one resulted in the death of Ramses’ own son. Devastated, Ramses finally freed the slaves.  The Treasure Cities of Ramses: The Hebrews hastily began their trek into the desert, where they wandered, fed by manna and guided by pillars of smoke and fire. At the Edge of the Red Sea: Driven by vengeance and Nefertari’s goading, Ramses sent his armies to overtake the escaped slaves. The Hebrews, trapped on high cliffs overlooking the Red Sea, began to panic, but Moses urged them to have faith. As he raised his staff, the sea parted, opening a pathway for their escape. The Egyptian soldiers tried to follow, but the sea closed, drowning them. At the Foot of Mount Sinai: Wandering in the desert, the Hebrews became discontented and afraid. Moses left the group at the base of Mt. Sinai while he ascended to the peak to seek God's help. There he received The Ten Commandments, a basic law of human conduct. He brought the commandments back to his people, only to find that they had descended into idolatry and sin. Enraged and disappointed, he broke the law tablets and threatened that God would punish the Hebrews. The people repented, accepted the new law, and thus prepared to enter The Promised Land.

U.N.C.L.E. then seeks out notorious safe cracker  Luther Sebastian to help them obtain the device from Dr. Kharmusi. Sebastian is on an island among a religious group called “The Third Way”, a mystical organization with disciples having – except for Sebastian – platinum white hair and all having a belief that when the “Old Man” in their group finally speaks after twenty years of silence The Third Way will have dominion over the world. Wanted in nearly two dozen countries Sebastian agrees to leave the island and help U.N.C.L.E. in return for world-wide immunity from prosecution. Solo makes his way to Dr. Kharmusi’s fortress but is initially delayed by Annie and her friend Aksoy. She feels that Sebastian can help free her fiancé and Aksoy’s brother, both of whom were unjustly imprisoned because of Sebastian. However, Dr. Kharmusi’s wife Azalea betrays her husband, kills Aksoy, abandons Annie, and helps Solo get into the fortress. Unfortunately for Solo, Annie follows him and, claiming to be his wife, gains access herself. Despite the setback Solo locates the safe and informs Kuryakin and Sebastian . Sebastian steals the prism - from a safe he himself designed - while Solo and Azalea are caught and tortured in a room slowly filling with sand. Kuryakin rescues them, but a brief fight results in Kharmusi’s death. His death automatically triggers a self-destruct device in his fortress, so the U.N.C.L.E. group flees the area immediately with the prism. Safely outside the blast radius, Sebastian reveals that he and Azalea  have been working together and the entire course of events has been his plan. They felt they could only steal the device with U.N.C.L.E.’s help and explain that by launching the thermal prism into orbit they can get countries to pay protection money of any amount. Sebastian then traps Solo, Kuryakin, and Annie on a boat placed on a collision course with the extraction ship. Escaping moments before the craft is destroyed by a defensively fired torpedo, the group is picked up and taken back to U.N.C.L.E. HQ in New York. Regrouping, Solo leaves to speak to Sebastian’s wife in Los Angeles. She denies knowing where Sebastian is, but as soon as Solo leaves she phones Sebastian at his launch facility. Sebastian orders Solo killed, but Solo instead kills his white-haired attackers. He adopts white coloring in his hair, takes the place of one of the men he killed, and reports in with other similar men for a briefing where Sebastian says their mission is to steal a U.S. rocket. Solo thereafter distinguishes himself by helping the group steal the rocket from a train. Kuryakin meanwhile follows up on a lead from Solo and investigates a suspicious connection between Sebastian and an abandoned theater in Los Angeles. Followed by Annie and an identical brother of Askoy, Kuryakin discovers that the theater is hosting a status briefing for followers of The Third Way. They are then all captured, but Askoy’s brother is killed by an ejector seat along the highway. Sebastian then remotely triggers a gas release that kills all the white-haired party goers except for Solo, who barely escapes and meets a third identical Askoy brother. Solo returns to Sebastian’s wife and tricks her into contacting Sebastian. Tracing the call, U.N.C.L.E. discovers the local building from which Sebastian’s launch facility is hidden. Askoy’s third brother and Solo infiltrate the building. After a battle in which the Askoy brother dies, Sebastian falls through an open hatch in the rocket and is launched along with it. U.N.C.L.E. reinforcements arrive, the rocket self-destructs, and the “old man” dies without having spoken. Back at U.N.C.L.E.

Alone and illiterate upon his arrival, he falls under the sway of Corsican mobsters, led by Cesar Luciani , who enforces a brutal rule. The prison is divided between two main factions: the Corsicans and the Muslims. Malik keeps to himself. When Luciani forces him to be the unwilling assassin of Reyeb, a Muslim witness, Malik gains the protection of the Corsicans in spite of his origin. Malik serves as a low-level servant to the Corsicans, who treat him with disdain. All the while, he is haunted by visions of the murdered Reyeb. When the bulk of the Corsicans are transferred or released, Luciani is forced to give Malik more responsibility. Having secretly learned Corsican, Malik acts as Luciani's eyes and ears in the prison. When Malik earns the privilege of day-long furloughs outside the prison, Luciani relies on him to conduct his business outside. Ryad, a Muslim friend, teaches Malik to read and write, and the two become close. Ryad exposes Malik to his own heritage, allowing him to meet two other Muslims, Tarik and Hassan, increasing his power within the prison. Malik also becomes involved with a prison drug dealer, Jordi. When Ryad gains an early release due to his testicular cancer, the three partners organize a drug-running enterprise. But when Ryad is kidnapped by the drug dealer Latif, Malik tracks down Latif's partner inside the prison, kidnaps his family, and forces Latif's gang to release Ryad. When Luciani discovers that Malik is using his furloughs for his own personal enterprise, he attacks him. Malik is sent to meet Brahim Lattrache in Marseille, another Muslim, who is involved in a deal between Luciani and the Lingherris, an Italian mafia group. Lattrache is bitter toward the Corsicans for the murder of Reyeb and holds Malik at gunpoint. When Malik spots a deer warning sign, he remembers a recent dream of deer running in the road. He tells his kidnappers that they are in danger of hitting a deer, which they promptly do. Lattrache is impressed by Malik, calling him a prophet and agreeing to do business with him instead of Luciani. Luciani believes there is a mole in his organization and decides to use Malik to assassinate Jacky Marcaggi, the Don of the Corsican mafia, for secretly dealing with the Lingherris. But Malik and Ryad have their own plan for Marcaggi: they kill his bodyguards and dump him in a van with his enemy Vettori, Luciani's henchman. Malik takes refuge at Ryad's house with his wife and young son. Ryad's cancer has returned; his decision against more chemotherapy leaves him just six months and he gets Malik's promise to take care of his family when he's gone. Upon Malik's return to the prison, he joins the Muslim side of the yard, having built a place of power within their faction. When Luciani tries to approach him, two Muslims intercept and beat him. The day of Malik's release he is met outside the prison by Ryad's wife and son. They walk off together, followed by a convoy of Malik's new gangster associates.

Alex attempts to turn Oscar's interest toward The Tibetan Book of the Dead, a Buddhist book about the afterlife. The first act follows Oscar's nightly routine through strict point-of-view shots, including momentary blackouts that represent blinking, and extended sequences of drug-induced hallucination. Oscar and Alex leave the apartment to deliver drugs to Oscar's friend Victor. On the way, Alex explains parts of The Tibetan Book of the Dead to Oscar: how the spirit of a dead person sometimes stays among the living until it begins to experience nightmares, after which it attempts to reincarnate. They arrive at a bar called The Void. Oscar enters alone and sits down with a distressed Victor, who mutters ""I'm sorry"" before they are swarmed by police officers. Oscar seals himself in a bathroom stall and attempts to flush his drugs. When the flush does not work, he yells through the door that he has a gun and will shoot. In response, a police officer fires and hits Oscar, who falls to the floor. Oscar's viewpoint rises and looks at his body from above, and then we begin to witness his life in a roughly chronological order. His loving parents were killed in a violent car crash; Oscar and Linda, devoted to each other, were sent to different foster homes; Oscar moved to Tokyo and earned money through drug dealing until he could afford to bring Linda to live with him; Linda found work as a stripper for the nightclub owner Mario, to Oscar's distress; Oscar increased the scope of his dealing operations and started using potent psychedelics—in particular, DMT—more frequently; Victor discovered that Oscar slept with Victor's mother; and finally, we again see Oscar meet Victor at The Void to sell him drugs, only to be shot in the bathroom. Next, a disembodied Oscar floats over Tokyo and witnesses the aftermath of his death. Linda becomes withdrawn and despondent, especially after getting an abortion; Oscar's dealer, Bruno, destroys his stash; Alex lives in hiding on the streets, and Linda wishes she would have been with Alex instead of Mario, as Oscar had wanted. On one occasion Linda wishes that Oscar would come back to life; Oscar then enters Linda's head, after which he wakes up at the morgue. Linda and Mario arrive and pick him up, but they are disgusted by him and he is unable to speak. Oscar is eventually convinced by Alex that he is dreaming, and returns to watch his friends from a floating perspective. Victor screams at his mother because she had sex with his friend and is thrown out of his parents' home. He shows up at Linda's apartment and apologises for having her brother killed, but says Linda is partially to blame since she hung around with creeps. This angers Linda, who repeatedly screams that Victor should kill himself. Oscar hovers high above Tokyo and enters an airplane, where he sees his mother, who breast-feeds a baby to whom she whispers Oscar's name. The view then drops to Linda and Alex, who take a taxi to a Tokyo love hotel and have sex. Oscar moves between hotel rooms and observes several other couples having sex in various positions. Each couple emanates a pulsating electric-like glow from their genitals. Oscar enters Alex's head and witnesses the sex with Linda from Alex's point of view. He then travels inside Linda's vagina to witness Alex's thrusting, then observes his ejaculation and follows the semen into the fertilisation of his sister's ovum. The final scene is shot from the perspective of a baby being born to Oscar's mother. According to the director, this is a flashback to Oscar's birth in the form of a false memory."

They decide to take a trip from Arizona to Malibu, and plan on staying with Michelle's Uncle Benny. The only problem is that they never told him they were coming. However, luck is on their side because he will be going out of town that afternoon. Uncle Benny forbids that there be any parties, saying that the last time he trusted a neighbor to house sit, they threw a wild party, and that he hates parties. Meanwhile, he is having an affair with a next door neighbor. When Michelle and Brian get there, they meet the not-so-preppy Gloria, who is filling in as maid because her mother is sick. She immediately clashes with Michelle and Brianne. Later, Michelle's nerdy cousin Denise flies out to Malibu. Although they don't get along all that well, Denise is happy to see her cousin Michelle. At this point, Michelle, Brianne, Denise and Gloria decide to team up and throw a party as a bet to see who could get more people to come. The teams are Brianne and Michelle against Denise and Gloria. Randy and Jeff, two workers at a local hotel, get word of this. Randy is perceived as a ""man whore"", while Jeff is more of a sensitive guy. Jeff later meets Denise, and has an immediate attraction to her even though Randy refers to her as ""plain"" and an ""ugly duckling."" Word of the party spreads quickly, and it soon becomes out of control. Randy  goes after her again. She takes him upstairs, but leave him there naked, where he is later found masturbating by Denise and Jeff. Before the party, while the girls were getting ready and giving Denise a makeover to make her less frumpy, they missed a call from Uncle Benny, saying he will be home early. He comes home in the midst of the party, but has to sneak in because he refuses to pay the bouncer for his entry. He clears everyone out, and finds Michelle passed out with a hangover in his bed. He discovers that his neighbor, whom he was dating, knew about the party. She convinces him that the girls are just kids, and it is okay. With the money they raised at the door, the girls pay for all the damages. In return, Uncle Benny buys all four of them tickets to Hawaii for next spring break, to ensure that they won't be back for more parties."

Richard Garriott is billed as 'The Gunfight Participant' – a satirical nod to his official status as a 'Spaceflight Participant.' These six were all the crew aboard the International Space Station during Garriott's time aboard. After this preview, the film proper begins. A series of motion graphics under the credits leads us to a Soyuz spacecraft departing the International Space Station, bearing Garriott, Volkov, and Kononenko back to earth. Finke and Chamitoff wave goodbye but express their relief at Garriott's leaving as he was annoying them with his constant talk of computer games. Lonchakov insists that they all go back to work. One week later, Chamitoff and Fincke are both missing Garriott. Chamitoff could no longer juggle without Garriott, and Fincke knew Garriott was good at settling arguments about which of them was standing upside down. At this point Lonchakov points out that the oxygen use aboard the station is too high. Everyone theorizes wildly about the cause which universally involve interstellar aliens invading the station. A search of ridiculous locations on the station ensues during which the surprising nature of the alien is discovered. The completed film is just over eight minutes in length. It includes numerous references to classic science-fiction movies including The Day the Earth Stood Still, Forbidden Planet and Galaxy Quest.

He refuses to testify or plead guilty or not guilty to the charges. The film alternates between flashbacks and the courtroom, as witnesses give their testimony. Showgirl Ginger Martin  takes the stand against his protest. Ginger tells how she, broke and stranded, met O'Hearn and his friend, Marine Private First Class Davy White , in Shanghai two weeks before the attack on Pearl Harbor. With war looming, their Marine regiment is ordered home. White slips away to propose marriage so that Ginger can be evacuated from China  as his wife. O'Hearn tracks him down at the nightclub where Ginger works. When the club's manager objects to Ginger quitting, a brawl breaks out. The trio escape aboard a small motor boat. When the two men start fighting, Ginger tries to help White and accidentally disables the boat. They drift out to sea and are picked up by a passing junk. Once again, the Marines quarrel over White's future. This time, they accidentally set the sail on fire. They have to chop down the mast in order to save the ship. As a result, they are put ashore on the Vichy French island of Namou. To avoid being jailed, the Marines persuade pro-Axis Governor Pierre Marchand  that they are deserters. They are quartered in a hotel/brothel run by Lillie Duval and her three ""nieces"". O'Hearn is delighted to make their acquaintance, to Ginger's annoyance. When a supposedly Dutch yacht calls at the island, O'Hearn tries to book passage, but the captain, Van Dorck , refuses to take the risk. O'Hearn discovers that Van Dorck is actually a Nazi setting up radar stations on the islands around Guadalcanal, and plots to seize the ship with the help of expatriates like ex-U.S. Navy sailor ""Jimmylegs"" Donovan  and fugitive bank embezzler Smith, and Free French liberated from the prison. White refuses to join and says he is deserting and intends to remain on the island with Ginger. This causes Ginger to have second thoughts about their relationship. O'Hearn forces White on board the yacht at gunpoint. Back in the courtroom, O'Hearn breaks his silence in order to exonerate White. When Van Dorck and a search party find him, O'Hearn manages to kill them all. He and his men then overthrow the governor and load the island's armory on the ship, intending to join the fighting at Guadalcanal. Ginger slips aboard as a patriotic stowaway. They stumble upon a group of Japanese landing craft escorted by a destroyer. O'Hearn engages the Japanese in a fierce battle. When the destroyer tries to ram the yacht, White jumps aboard and climbs its smokestack. He throws in explosives, blowing up the destroyer at the cost of his own life. Only O'Hearn and Ginger survive; the rest of the crew die heroically. The court martial exonerates O'Hearn and recommends White for a posthumous Congressional Medal of Honor. O'Hearn and Ginger then admit they love each other."

As the detective and district attorney converse about Billy's case, the movie is told in flashback. Billy is shown running a severed pig's head and hoofs up and down the body of a prostitute , in a strangely sexual sequence, as the detective narrates. Billy's modus operandi of luring prostitutes to his sister's expensive home to drug and kill them is shown in a series of episodes. His first victim  is drowned in a bath tub, placed in a large wheeled trash can, taken to the family pig farm, and fed into a woodchipper. The remaining episodes follow a similar pattern. The next victim, played by Kate Hackett, is drugged and abused in one of the bedrooms of Billy's sister's house. The abuse is interrupted by a housekeeper , who quietly observes Billy move the drugged woman into a trash can and wheel her to the pig farm. There, he suffocates her and feeds her hand into a meat grinder. Billy forces alcohol down the throat of the next victim . He drags the incapacitated woman around the house, up the stairs, forcing her to swallow pills before killing her. She is later fed to the woodchipper. Throughout the film, the detective implies and then finally accuses Billy of mixing the remains of the victims with pork meat that was then sold to a national food market chain for public consumption. In flashback dinner scenes with his sister  and brother , Billy does not answer questions about why the pork products ""taste so good."" After the next victim  is strangled and buried alive, Billy is interrupted by three teenage hitch hikers, one of whom he treats for a spider bite before sending them on their way, unharmed. Billy narrates how his mother made an audio recording of his father's  death, which forever colored his view of women as ""evil whores."" There is a brief flashback of Billy dancing and frolicking with a prostitute , and attending church. Billy's next victim, Annie , is treated to a tour of the house attic, and their relationship starts to take a bizarre romantic tone. She reads an Edgar Allan Poe poem to Billy before he drugs her -- she wants him to kill her. However, he cannot bring himself to feed Annie to the woodchipper, because as the detective intones, ""She was the only woman he ever cared for."" In the pig farm basement, the brother discovers Billy and Annie's corpse, which leads to Billy's arrest. The movie ends with title cards that explain that Billy may have killed ""as many as 135 ... unfortunate women."""

When they enter the dig site, which is a large underground laboratory, they encounter a priest who has strange boils all over his body. The team's medic, Doc  sedates the priest. Click  uses the dig sites terminal to activate the elevator and notices something codenamed the Gehenna Project and asks Cardell if she knows what it is but she denies knowing about it. Mack orders Nickels  to stay and watch the priest while the rest of the team takes the elevator deeper into the dig site. When they exit the elevator they encounter a scientist named Duncan  who has strange boils like the priest. Duncan attacks Hammer  but is shot in the chest by Mack. While treating Duncan's wound, Doc has a hallucination of her sister angry at her for letting her die. Duncan and Doc disappear but the team uses Doc's tracking device to follow after them. The team splits up and Yoshi  follows a hallucination of her and Hicks's  unborn daughter. The team runs into Duncan who is trying to open the door to the safe room. Duncan yells at the team about their ignorance to salvation and Mack shoots him in the head, which strangely doesn't kill him but when the entire team shoots him he finally dies. The door to the safety room is opened from the inside revealing a priest named Fulton , who Cardell knows, tells them that Doc was likely taken to the temple and he agrees to take them there. The team notices that Yoshi is missing and when they find her, she tells the team of her hallucination and Fulton explains that the possessed use visions to tempt humans, Mack then duct tapes Fulton's mouth shut. Nickels hallucinates a nude woman and he is attacked by the priest, Nickels fights back with a knife but has his arm broken and the priest spits a dark fluid in his mouth, then drags him away. Click is separated from the team and encounters Doc locked in some room, when he tries to help her he is attacked by a possessed obese scientist, Hammer shows up and rescues him, when more possessed start to appear, Hammer decides to throws explosives at the group, causing the passage to collapse. Fulton and the team arrive at the temple where they learn from Fulton and Cardell that the scientists are possessed because they absorbed the spirit of a Nephilim, which is frozen in the temple, to prevent it from escaping. Fulton explains that the dig site is one of many tombs created by God to imprison Nephilim. Yoshi follows the hallucination to Doc, who is revealed to be possessed. She seduces Yoshi and allows her to lick strange, infectious boils on her shoulder; infecting her. Doc then cuts her back open. When the team notices that Yoshi is missing, Hicks and Hammer try to find her. During their search, a possessed Doc attacks Hammer who aims his gun at her after he notices that she has developed boils, Hicks points his gun at Hammer who tries to tell Hicks that Doc is possessed, Hicks doesn't believe him and shoots at Hammer who manages to run away. Hicks then chases Doc and then finds Yoshi, whose spine is exposed, he tries to help her but she attacks him and then Doc rips his throat out. Hammer arrives back at the temple to tell Mack about Doc and Hicks. Fulton realizes that Cardell activated the Gehenna Project with Click's unintentional help, which is a self-destruct device for the dig site, and runs for the elevator alone. The soldiers only have fifteen minutes to get to the elevator before the explosion. The door to the temple slowly starts closing. Mack, Cardell, and Click make it out of the temple but Hammer gets locked in the temple and surrounded by possessed scientists, he puts up a fight but is overwhelmed and sets off his grenades killing himself and the possessed scientists attacking him. Fulton is pushed into barbed wire by Doc who then slits his throat. Mack, Cardell, and Click arrive at the area where they encountered Duncan for the first time, and they meet up with Wesley who is possessed but doesn't have the boils. Doc and Nickel, who is now possessed, arrive and Mack and Click shoot him and a few other possessed until the possessed priest grabs Click, who drags him away and kills him. Mack has a hallucination of his old best friend Blakeley  who Mack was ordered to murder years ago. Mack resists and shoots an explosive barrel next to Wesley which burns him and kills Doc along with the hallucination of Blakeley. Cardell stands over Wesley and sets his soul free, when Mack tells her that they have to leave she refuses saying that her goal was to set her father's soul free. Mack makes it to the elevator alone and escapes the dig site seconds before the explosion. Mack is then picked up by the helicopter and realizes that he has a new purpose in the world, that he is a new soldier in an ancient war.

She notices that while the assassin stands emotionless in front of her, his eyes begin to shed tears. The assassin introduces himself to Emu as ""Yo"" . Days later, after Emu returns to her home in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, the Hakushin Society led by Shido Shimazaki ([[Mako  make their appearance at the local police precinct, announcing a war between his clan and the ""Sons of the Dragons"" - a Chinese Triad that ordered the assassination of Shimazaki's son in San Francisco. Interpol detective Netah  explains to the police that the Sons of the Dragons are descendants of 108 Buddhist monks who rebelled against the Manchu reign in China centuries ago, and that they have their bringer of death known in the underworld as the ""Freeman."" Shimazaki then tells everyone that Emu is the Freeman's next target, as she was the only witness to his son's assassination, and the assassin's code is that a person who is given Freeman's name becomes his next kill. However, shortly after their meeting is adjourned, Shimazaki and his bodyguards are ambushed outside the precinct by a masked Freeman and his assistant Koh  . After dispatching the bodyguards and disabling the nearby police officers, Freeman successfully kills Shimazaki before running off. During his escape, he passes by Emu, who recognizes his eyes through his mask. As Freeman and Koh flee the scene, Emu utters Yo's name to the surprise of Detective Forge , who is assigned to protect her. Later that night, Emu is interrogated by Netah and Forge over Freeman's identity. Due to a lack of evidence, she is shortly released and escorted back to her mansion. As Netah scouts the mansion's perimeters, he discovers that Forge is knocked unconscious and he encounters Ryuji Hanada  and wife Kimie Hanada , who are out to claim the Freeman's head and take over the Hakushin Society. Inside the mansion, Emu discovers that Yo is in her room and begins to accept her fate. Yo, however, decides not to kill her and instead, makes love with her. Minutes later, Hanada's men enter the mansion, prompting Yo to immediately kill them before Ryuji confronts him. Koh throws a knife at Ryuji's back and a gun towards Yo. As Yo guns Ryuji down, Ryuji fires his machine pistol out of control, severely wounding Emu. Despite his orders, Yo cannot bring himself to kill Emu; instead, he has Koh drive them to the nearest hospital. En route, Yo tells Emu his last name being Hinomura, and to find him in Hokkaidō, Japan. It is later on revealed that Ryuji survived the gunfight by wearing a bulletproof vest. With the help of members of the Sons of the Dragons , Emu escapes police security at the hospital and flies to Japan to reunite with Yo. Yo tells Emu about his past before becoming the Freeman. He was a renowned pottery artist who had an exhibition in New York. During the exhibit, someone was murdered by two unknown assailants. He realized that the murder victim placed a roll of film inside one of his vases several seconds prior to his death. Yo developed the photos in his hotel bathroom, revealing the torture and execution of a man wearing dragon tattoos similar to what he would eventually wear. Before leaving his hotel, he was drugged and abducted by the Sons of the Dragons, who implanted subliminal messages into his mind using acupuncture techniques. During his first mission, where he killed Mafia boss Antonio Rossi, he began to shed tears; hence his name Crying Freeman. Yo is notified by Koh that Ryuji and his men have attacked a soya factory in Shanghai, China, that was protected by the Sons of the Dragons. As retribution, Yo and Koh travel to Shimazaki's funeral outside Tokyo to kill Ryuji and wipe out the Shimazaki clan. During the funeral, while having sex inside a closet, Kimie reveals to Netah that the Shimazakis were set up by the Hanadas to be assassinated so they could take over the clan. Disguised as Yakuza members recently released from prison, Yo and Koh begin their killing spree on the Yakuza clan. After incapacitating Ryuji by impaling his hand on a wall, Koh tells Yo to make an escape route while he deals with Ryuji personally by dropping an explosive in his pants. While Yo makes his escape, Koh attempts to kill him, only to be gunned down by Ryuji before the explosive destroys him and the house. A dying Koh tells Yo that he was ordered by the Sons of the Dragons to kill him for treason. A vengeful Kimie shoots Koh to death following Freeman's escape. Yo returns to his home, where he prepares the area to self-destruct and arms himself to battle Netah and Kimie, along with her henchmen. Despite being wounded by Netah, Yo kills the henchmen and defeats Netah and Kimie - the latter by stabbing her near the heart. Yo then gives them an alibi that he killed Shimazaki on a personal feud and that he and Emu committed suicide. When Kimie refuses to accept the alibi on grounds of her husband's death, Yo pulls the knife off her chest, increasing her blood loss. Kimie then accepts the alibi and has her wound mended. While Yo and Emu leave the premises, Netah prepares to shoot them from behind, only to be killed by Kimie. Yo and Emu are last seen riding a speedboat into the sunset."

As Netah scouts the mansion's perimeters, he discovers that Forge is knocked unconscious and he encounters Ryuji Hanada  and wife Kimie Hanada , who are out to claim the Freeman's head and take over the Hakushin Society. Inside the mansion, Emu discovers that Yo is in her room and begins to accept her fate. Yo, however, decides not to kill her and instead, makes love with her. Minutes later, Hanada's men enter the mansion, prompting Yo to immediately kill them before Ryuji confronts him. Koh throws a knife at Ryuji's back and a gun towards Yo. As Yo guns Ryuji down, Ryuji fires his machine pistol out of control, severely wounding Emu. Despite his orders, Yo cannot bring himself to kill Emu; instead, he has Koh drive them to the nearest hospital. En route, Yo tells Emu his last name being Hinomura, and to find him in Hokkaidō, Japan. It is later on revealed that Ryuji survived the gunfight by wearing a bulletproof vest. With the help of members of the Sons of the Dragons , Emu escapes police security at the hospital and flies to Japan to reunite with Yo. Yo tells Emu about his past before becoming the Freeman. He was a renowned pottery artist who had an exhibition in New York. During the exhibit, someone was murdered by two unknown assailants. He realized that the murder victim placed a roll of film inside one of his vases several seconds prior to his death. Yo developed the photos in his hotel bathroom, revealing the torture and execution of a man wearing dragon tattoos similar to what he would eventually wear. Before leaving his hotel, he was drugged and abducted by the Sons of the Dragons, who implanted subliminal messages into his mind using acupuncture techniques. During his first mission, where he killed Mafia boss Antonio Rossi, he began to shed tears; hence his name Crying Freeman. Yo is notified by Koh that Ryuji and his men have attacked a soya factory in Shanghai, China, that was protected by the Sons of the Dragons. As retribution, Yo and Koh travel to Shimazaki's funeral outside Tokyo to kill Ryuji and wipe out the Shimazaki clan. During the funeral, while having sex inside a closet, Kimie reveals to Netah that the Shimazakis were set up by the Hanadas to be assassinated so they could take over the clan. Disguised as Yakuza members recently released from prison, Yo and Koh begin their killing spree on the Yakuza clan. After incapacitating Ryuji by impaling his hand on a wall, Koh tells Yo to make an escape route while he deals with Ryuji personally by dropping an explosive in his pants. While Yo makes his escape, Koh attempts to kill him, only to be gunned down by Ryuji before the explosive destroys him and the house. A dying Koh tells Yo that he was ordered by the Sons of the Dragons to kill him for treason. A vengeful Kimie shoots Koh to death following Freeman's escape. Yo returns to his home, where he prepares the area to self-destruct and arms himself to battle Netah and Kimie, along with her henchmen. Despite being wounded by Netah, Yo kills the henchmen and defeats Netah and Kimie - the latter by stabbing her near the heart. Yo then gives them an alibi that he killed Shimazaki on a personal feud and that he and Emu committed suicide. When Kimie refuses to accept the alibi on grounds of her husband's death, Yo pulls the knife off her chest, increasing her blood loss. Kimie then accepts the alibi and has her wound mended. While Yo and Emu leave the premises, Netah prepares to shoot them from behind, only to be killed by Kimie. Yo and Emu are last seen riding a speedboat into the sunset."

The movers walk Granny’s things past Sylvester as he is napping on top of the wall surrounding the house. Sylvester suddenly wakes up when the movers parade Tweety in his cage past him, and Tweety says: “I tawt I taw a puddytat!” Immediately, Sylvester starts to pursue Tweety atop the wall, but then crashes into a lamp post and falls off the wall.

Lucky considers it a strange offer, but he needs the money so he takes the job. What Downing doesn’t know is that Elinor’s three former fiancés have met horrible ends. The first, Johnny Eggleston, mysteriously drowned. The second, Paul Myron, was paralyzed when his car rolled over and has been confined to an iron lung ever since. The third, Alan Winters, died by snakebite while on the 18th floor of a Boston hotel. Given the fate of her former beaus, there are those who believe Elinor is the victim of the “Smiling Ghost,” and she has been dubbed the “Kiss of Death Girl” by the local newspapers. Lil Barstow, a reporter who has followed the case closely, has been in touch with Myron, who persuades her to talk Downing out of the engagement before he too becomes a victim of the ghost. Lil attempts to intercept Lucky at the train station where he and his nervous valet, Clarence, are to meet Elinor. Before Lil can warn Downing, however, Elinor smashes her camera and hustles Lucky and Clarence off to Bentley mansion. Downing is delighted to find Elinor so attractive and affectionate but has no idea what awaits him at the mansion. There he meets his prospective in-laws: a diabolical great-uncle Ames Bentley, who shows Lucky his collection of shrunken heads and mentions that he's only missing a good Negroid specimen; cousin Tennant Bentley, who has a drinking problem; and Uncle Hilton Fairchild and his wife Rose, who will lose part of their fortune should Elinor marry. That evening Tennant drunkenly objects to Lucky sleeping in what had been his room, so Lucky agrees to switch rooms with him. Later that night, a man who is presumably the Smiling Ghost emerges through a secret wall panel and attacks Tennant, no doubt believing him to be Downing. In the ensuing confusion, Downing encounters the reporter Lil Barstow outside, who tells him about the fate of the former fiancés and persuades him to leave. Lucky asks her, ""Couldn't all these have all been accidents?"" To which Lil reples, ""Listen, it's more than an accident when a cobra strikes a man on the 18th floor of a Boston hotel."" Convinced that the situation is perilous, Downing plans to sneak away with Clarence, who had found the semiconscious Tennant in a trunk in the cellar and is eager to depart; however, after Elinor confesses that she has fallen in love with him, he decides to stay and catch the ""ghost"" for her. To find the ghost or whoever it is, Downing turns to Lil for help. She takes him to visit the crippled Paul Myron. Paul relates his ghost story, saying that the ghost appeared when he was pinned under his wrecked car and adding that the ghost resembled John Eggleston, Elinor’s first fiancé. Paul says he believes Eggleston drowned himself after Elinor broke off their engagement and is now intent on making sure she never marries. Downing rejects the idea that Eggleston is a ghost but finds it plausible that he faked his death and is bent on revenge. Lil and Lucky then pay a visit to Eggleston’s crypt in the cemetery and discover it empty. While there, Downing is attacked by the “ghost” and entombed.

Seven years later, Chanel and Stravinsky meet again. Although her business has flourished, Chanel is mourning the death of her lover, Arthur ""Boy"" Capel. Stravinsky has chosen to flee to France following the Russian Revolution. An immediate sympathy and attraction occurs between the ‘couturiere’ and the composer.

His mother  sent Goemon away for safety, but she was killed moments after herself. Running away with his caretaker, they were attacked by bandits, but he was saved by the great Nobunaga Oda . Goemon followed Nobunaga and he was assigned to Hattori Hanzō , to train him in the ways of the shinobi  along with his martial brother, Saizō . After many years of training, Goemon was assigned to shadow Oda's niece, Princess Chacha . They developed feelings for each other, but they could not be together due to status differences, and eventually she departs. Before leaving, Chacha gave Goemon her favourite fan to remember her by. As a gift for his service in protecting Chacha, Oda gifted Goemon his double-bladed sword. Meanwhile, Oda's generals, Toyotomi Hideyoshi  and Akechi Mitsuhide , conspired to kill Nobunaga. The two made a secret written covenant, placing their signatures onto a black scroll. Mitsuhide, not trusting Hideyoshi, had his men hide the contract. After assassinating Nobunaga, Hideyoshi betrayed and killed Mitsuhide, took credit for slaying Nobunaga's killer and became the next ruler of Japan. With Nobunaga dead, the two young ninjas parted ways for different pursuits: Saizo hopes to be elevated to Samurai status and chose to remain in service to Nobunaga, but Goemon chose to leave and be free. As a parting gift, Goemon broke his double-bladed sword in two and gave one-half to Saizo. Years later, Goemon became a master thief and a Robin Hood. Sarutobi Sasuke , an inexperienced bounty hunter, tried to arrest Goemon, but failed and became his private servant instead. During a festival, Goemon infiltrated and robbed a treasure repository that contains a mysterious box with foreign writing on it. Ishida Mitsunari , a high-ranking samurai under Lord Hideyoshi, tried to retrieve this box to destroy it, but Goemon escaped with it, leaving behind only his calling card: a red sticker with the Japanese character ""Go"" on it. Goemon, unaware of the value of the box, threw it away and distributed the gold to the poor. A young pick-pocket, Koheita, picked up the mysterious box and kept it as a memento. The following day, Goemon learned of the box's value from Sasuke. Intrigued by the box, Goemon returned to the city to find it. Searching around the slums for the box, Goemon heard a scream and finds Koheita and his mother, who had just been callously murdered by cruel and petty local samurai. Goemon saved Koheita and retrieved the box, but also took Koheita under his wing. Saizo and his ninja squad, working for Mitsunari, appeared and confronted Goemon. Refusing to turn over the box, Goemon fled and was pursued by Saizo's ninjas. Goemon evaded all of his pursuers except Saizo, who remained close behind him. In a showdown between the former brothers, Saizo informed him that the box Goemon carried was referred to as a ""Pandora's Box"" by foreigners, and the two engaged in a duel. After being caught and about to be killed by Saizo, Hattori Hanzo appeared and intervened, causing Saizo to withdraw. After returning to the city, Goemon examined the ""empty box"" and discovered a map to a mysterious treasure. Following the map, Goemon and Sasuke were led to the destroyed Buddha statue where Akechi Mitsuhide had hidden his contract with Hideyoshi. Goemon became angry once he learned that Hideyoshi was involved with Nobunaga's death. Hattori Hanzo then reappeared, under the command of Tokugawa Ieyasu . Hanzo offered his old student a bag of gold for the contract, which Goemon readily agrees to. Seeking vengeance for his murdered lord, Goemon infiltrated Lord Hideyoshi's castle, where he killed Lord Hideyoshi and discovered Princess Chacha. Startled by another person entering, Goemon hid himself in the ceiling of Chacha's room, losing Chacha's fan as he did so. To Goemon's surprise, the real Hideyoshi entered the room. Goemon had only killed his fake double. Suddenly, one of Lord Hideyoshi's guards discovered Goemon and shot him in the chest, blowing him out of the castle and into the moat. Later, Goemon was secretly rescued and recovered by Saizo. Goemon was then contacted by Hanzo, who took him to a waterfall to meet Chacha. The princess had come to bid him farewell and returned the fan as she had reluctantly agreed to become Hideyoshi's concubine. Afterwards, Lord Tokugawa arrived to ask Goemon to assassinate Hideyoshi in order to save Chacha and country. Elsewhere, Lord Mitsunari offered Saizo samurai status in return for killing Lord Hideyoshi. Goemon and Lord Tokugawa crafted a plan to assassinate Lord Hideyoshi during a celebration on his royal boat, but upon receiving his secret signal, Goemon changed his mind and did not complete the plan. Moments later, all of Lord Hideyoshi's escort ships were destroyed by explosives set by Saizo and his team; they captured Lord Hideyoshi and tried to assassinate him by hanging him from the ship's mast with a steel chain. Lord Mitsunari, believing Lord Hideyoshi to be dead, then turned on Saizo and shot him. However, Lord Hideyoshi survived the assassination attempt, while Saizo survived the gunshot wound. Lord Hideyoshi, unaware of Lord Mitsunari's betrayal, interrogated Saizo and threatened to kill Saizo's family unless he revealed who hired him. Meanwhile, Goemon tried to rescue Chacha, but because Lord Hideyoshi was still alive, she refused to leave. Later, against Sasuske's warnings, Goemon rescued Saizo from prison. Unfortunately, this caused Lord Mitsunari to kill Saizo's wife and take his child as a hostage. Saizo was later recaptured and Lord Hideyoshi decreed Saizo be executed during an elaborate public execution. Saizo was to be boiled to death if he didn't reveal his identity and he falsely identified himself as Goemon. Goemon tried to stop the execution, but he could only watch in horror as Lord Hideyoshi kicked Saizo into the cauldron and then threw in the child. Sasuke, disillusioned and in shock over all of the carnage, abandoned Goemon. With the help of Saizo's surviving team, Goemon stormed through the palace and eventually reached Lord Hideyoshi. Goemon wanted to know why Lord Hideyoshi had betrayed Lord Nobunaga. Hideyoshi explained it was his insatiable hunger for power that had driven him and Goemon eventually killed him. With Hideyoshi dead, there was a power vacuum that the strongest fought for. Tokugawa and Mitsunari raised their own armies to decide who would be the next ruler of Japan; tired of all the deaths and suffering, Goemon decided to intervene. Goemon charged into the battle, wearing Lord Nobunaga's armor and carrying the repaired double-bladed sword. The armies were fearful and confused as they saw the crimson armor of Nobunaga. Goemon fought through the armies until he confronted and killed Mitsunari during a solar eclipse. Superstitious over the eclipse, Mitsunari's army fled in fear. Goemon then charged through Tokugawa's army, but Hattori Hanzo appeared and intercepted him mid-way. Goemon immobilized his former master by pinning Hanzo's foot to the ground with a broken sword blade. Approaching Tokugawa, Goemon closed the distance seemingly with the intent to kill, but was intercepted by Sasuke . Mortally wounded by Sasuke, Goemon staggered and it was revealed that he was only holding Chacha's fan; instead of trying to kill Tokugawa, Goemon only wanted him to promise that there would finally be peace and left. Goemon tried to stumble back to Chacha, but fell to the ground from his wounds. In his final moments, he admired the fireflies and stars while Chacha sadly cried as he never returned to her side."

After many years of training, Goemon was assigned to shadow Oda's niece, Princess Chacha . They developed feelings for each other, but they could not be together due to status differences, and eventually she departs. Before leaving, Chacha gave Goemon her favourite fan to remember her by. As a gift for his service in protecting Chacha, Oda gifted Goemon his double-bladed sword. Meanwhile, Oda's generals, Toyotomi Hideyoshi  and Akechi Mitsuhide , conspired to kill Nobunaga. The two made a secret written covenant, placing their signatures onto a black scroll. Mitsuhide, not trusting Hideyoshi, had his men hide the contract. After assassinating Nobunaga, Hideyoshi betrayed and killed Mitsuhide, took credit for slaying Nobunaga's killer and became the next ruler of Japan. With Nobunaga dead, the two young ninjas parted ways for different pursuits: Saizo hopes to be elevated to Samurai status and chose to remain in service to Nobunaga, but Goemon chose to leave and be free. As a parting gift, Goemon broke his double-bladed sword in two and gave one-half to Saizo. Years later, Goemon became a master thief and a Robin Hood. Sarutobi Sasuke , an inexperienced bounty hunter, tried to arrest Goemon, but failed and became his private servant instead. During a festival, Goemon infiltrated and robbed a treasure repository that contains a mysterious box with foreign writing on it. Ishida Mitsunari , a high-ranking samurai under Lord Hideyoshi, tried to retrieve this box to destroy it, but Goemon escaped with it, leaving behind only his calling card: a red sticker with the Japanese character ""Go"" on it. Goemon, unaware of the value of the box, threw it away and distributed the gold to the poor. A young pick-pocket, Koheita, picked up the mysterious box and kept it as a memento. The following day, Goemon learned of the box's value from Sasuke. Intrigued by the box, Goemon returned to the city to find it. Searching around the slums for the box, Goemon heard a scream and finds Koheita and his mother, who had just been callously murdered by cruel and petty local samurai. Goemon saved Koheita and retrieved the box, but also took Koheita under his wing. Saizo and his ninja squad, working for Mitsunari, appeared and confronted Goemon. Refusing to turn over the box, Goemon fled and was pursued by Saizo's ninjas. Goemon evaded all of his pursuers except Saizo, who remained close behind him. In a showdown between the former brothers, Saizo informed him that the box Goemon carried was referred to as a ""Pandora's Box"" by foreigners, and the two engaged in a duel. After being caught and about to be killed by Saizo, Hattori Hanzo appeared and intervened, causing Saizo to withdraw. After returning to the city, Goemon examined the ""empty box"" and discovered a map to a mysterious treasure. Following the map, Goemon and Sasuke were led to the destroyed Buddha statue where Akechi Mitsuhide had hidden his contract with Hideyoshi. Goemon became angry once he learned that Hideyoshi was involved with Nobunaga's death. Hattori Hanzo then reappeared, under the command of Tokugawa Ieyasu . Hanzo offered his old student a bag of gold for the contract, which Goemon readily agrees to. Seeking vengeance for his murdered lord, Goemon infiltrated Lord Hideyoshi's castle, where he killed Lord Hideyoshi and discovered Princess Chacha. Startled by another person entering, Goemon hid himself in the ceiling of Chacha's room, losing Chacha's fan as he did so. To Goemon's surprise, the real Hideyoshi entered the room. Goemon had only killed his fake double. Suddenly, one of Lord Hideyoshi's guards discovered Goemon and shot him in the chest, blowing him out of the castle and into the moat. Later, Goemon was secretly rescued and recovered by Saizo. Goemon was then contacted by Hanzo, who took him to a waterfall to meet Chacha. The princess had come to bid him farewell and returned the fan as she had reluctantly agreed to become Hideyoshi's concubine. Afterwards, Lord Tokugawa arrived to ask Goemon to assassinate Hideyoshi in order to save Chacha and country. Elsewhere, Lord Mitsunari offered Saizo samurai status in return for killing Lord Hideyoshi. Goemon and Lord Tokugawa crafted a plan to assassinate Lord Hideyoshi during a celebration on his royal boat, but upon receiving his secret signal, Goemon changed his mind and did not complete the plan. Moments later, all of Lord Hideyoshi's escort ships were destroyed by explosives set by Saizo and his team; they captured Lord Hideyoshi and tried to assassinate him by hanging him from the ship's mast with a steel chain. Lord Mitsunari, believing Lord Hideyoshi to be dead, then turned on Saizo and shot him. However, Lord Hideyoshi survived the assassination attempt, while Saizo survived the gunshot wound. Lord Hideyoshi, unaware of Lord Mitsunari's betrayal, interrogated Saizo and threatened to kill Saizo's family unless he revealed who hired him. Meanwhile, Goemon tried to rescue Chacha, but because Lord Hideyoshi was still alive, she refused to leave. Later, against Sasuske's warnings, Goemon rescued Saizo from prison. Unfortunately, this caused Lord Mitsunari to kill Saizo's wife and take his child as a hostage. Saizo was later recaptured and Lord Hideyoshi decreed Saizo be executed during an elaborate public execution. Saizo was to be boiled to death if he didn't reveal his identity and he falsely identified himself as Goemon. Goemon tried to stop the execution, but he could only watch in horror as Lord Hideyoshi kicked Saizo into the cauldron and then threw in the child. Sasuke, disillusioned and in shock over all of the carnage, abandoned Goemon. With the help of Saizo's surviving team, Goemon stormed through the palace and eventually reached Lord Hideyoshi. Goemon wanted to know why Lord Hideyoshi had betrayed Lord Nobunaga. Hideyoshi explained it was his insatiable hunger for power that had driven him and Goemon eventually killed him. With Hideyoshi dead, there was a power vacuum that the strongest fought for. Tokugawa and Mitsunari raised their own armies to decide who would be the next ruler of Japan; tired of all the deaths and suffering, Goemon decided to intervene. Goemon charged into the battle, wearing Lord Nobunaga's armor and carrying the repaired double-bladed sword. The armies were fearful and confused as they saw the crimson armor of Nobunaga. Goemon fought through the armies until he confronted and killed Mitsunari during a solar eclipse. Superstitious over the eclipse, Mitsunari's army fled in fear. Goemon then charged through Tokugawa's army, but Hattori Hanzo appeared and intercepted him mid-way. Goemon immobilized his former master by pinning Hanzo's foot to the ground with a broken sword blade. Approaching Tokugawa, Goemon closed the distance seemingly with the intent to kill, but was intercepted by Sasuke . Mortally wounded by Sasuke, Goemon staggered and it was revealed that he was only holding Chacha's fan; instead of trying to kill Tokugawa, Goemon only wanted him to promise that there would finally be peace and left. Goemon tried to stumble back to Chacha, but fell to the ground from his wounds. In his final moments, he admired the fireflies and stars while Chacha sadly cried as he never returned to her side."

If he does not find someone who loves him by the next spring he would remain in his ugly state forever. Kyle is taken to live in a private house with their maid Zola  and a blind tutor Will Fratalli . Both are a comfort to Kyle when his father begins to neglect him. As spring draws closer, Kyle finds himself infatuated with Lindy Taylor , a girl whom he had kept distance from in his former school. He sees her father, a druggie, engaged in an altercation with two drug dealers and shoots one dead while the other vows to kill Lindy. Kyle persuades Lindy’s father to allow her to move in with him. Lindy is furious about hiding and doesn't speak to Kyle, but eventually, Kyle reveals himself and they begin to warm up to each other. Kyle writes a letter professing his love for Lindy but does not give it for fear of rejection. He visits Kendra to plead for more time and she refuses but agrees to restore Will's vision and grant citizenship to Zola's three children in Jamaica if he gets Lindy to fall in love with him. The criminal who threatened Lindy’s life lands up in jail. Lindy’s father is overdosed and is in hospital. Kyle permits Lindy to leave and see her father and drives her to the station. He gives her the letter but regrets doing so as she tells him he’s a good friend. Lindy calls him after reading the letter but being heartbroken Kyle does not answer them. Persuaded by Will and Zola, Kyle goes to meet Lindy one last time before she leaves on a school trip to Machu Picchu. Lindy professes her love, and departs for Machu Picchu. Kyle’s normal self is restored but Lindy does not recognize him until she calls his phone and finds that it is the phone of the restored Kyle that rings. Will wakes up one morning and can see again and Zola finds three green cards for her children in the mail from the government. Kendra approaches Rob Kingson's office as a new intern, implying that Kendra will likely do the same thing to Rob as she did to Kyle. At the end credits, vacation photos show Lindy and Kyle passionately together after high school, living happily ever after.  In the alternative ending of the film that is seen on the DVD, Kyle receives a voice message from Lindy telling him she loves him. However she has left on the school trip and Kyle believes he has lost his chance with her. He then receives another call from Lindy, who is being abducted by Victor, a drug dealer. Kyle runs throughout the city to save her and, upon reaching her and finding her in Victor's hold, leaps forward to save her but is shot in the process. Lindy goes to get help, but Kyle asks her to stay and she tells him she loves him as he dies. Lindy's tears, however, bring him back to life and restore him to his former self. At first, Lindy refuses to believe it is him but soon realizes it is really him and the two kiss. Kyle and Lindy then go to Prom together and Kyle thanks Kendra for what she has done. Afterwards, like the original ending, Kendra is taking an internship at Rob Kingson's office.

A tall fence surrounds the property and the children have never been on the other side of it, for their parents have kept them unaware of the outside world, even of the existence of the telephone. They are taught different meanings for everyday words. For example, they are told that a ""zombie"" is ""a small yellow flower,"" and that ""sea"" is a chair. The parents promise that each child will be ready to venture outside the compound once she or he has lost a dogtooth. Although the children are told they have a brother just on the other side of the barrier, he never appears. The only non-family member to come into the house is Christina, a young woman who works as a security guard at the father's factory. She is driven by the father to the compound – travelling both ways blindfolded – where she performs sexual favors for the son. Dissatisfied with his preference for intercourse, Christina seeks oral sex from the elder daughter in exchange for a headband. The elder daughter obliges but does not recognize the significance of performing cunnilingus. Later, she gives the headband to her younger sister, in exchange for being licked on the shoulder, which is marked by an unexplained scar. The parents have tricked the children into believing that overhead planes are merely toys. They allow the children to search for toy planes that they have planted on the grounds, and the child that finds the toy owns it. One day the older daughter finds her brother playing with her plane; she retaliates by cutting his arm with a kitchen knife. The father visits a dog training facility and demands to have his dog returned. The trainer refuses because the dog has only reached the second stage of a five-stage training. He lectures the father on the merits of retaining a dog in training until its training is complete, and warns against the untimely cessation of training. He poses the question: ""Do we want an animal or a friend?"" The father is impatient to receive the dog, as he expresses to his wife. When the arrival of the dog is considered imminent, the parents tell the children that the mother will soon give birth to ""two children and a dog"", but promise that the birth of the children can be forgone if the son and daughters show improvement in their behavior. The siblings are terrified by the appearance of a stray cat in the garden. Considering it a threat, the son ambushes and kills it with a pair of pruning shears. The parents decide to take advantage of the incident. The father shreds his clothes, covers himself in fake blood, and comes home, where he tells his children that their unseen brother was mauled to death by a cat, the most fearsome creature. The children are taught to get down on all fours and bark maniacally as a precaution against cats. A memorial service is held for the brother, in which the family members lob flowers over the fence, in mourning. Christina is again brought to the compound to perform her services and she once more requests oral sex from the elder daughter. However, the daughter rejects Christina's offer of hair gel as a reward, choosing instead the two films in Christina's bag (Rocky IV and [[Jaws . Christina refuses to hand over the films, but eventually agrees under threat of blackmail. The elder daughter watches the films at night, and they have a significant influence on her. She recreates scenes from the films and quotes them in her free moments. The father finds the videotapes, fashions one into a weapon with packing tape, and uses it to beat his daughter's head. Then he goes to Christina's flat, removes her VCR player from the wall and knocks her off her chair with it. As he leaves, he curses her future children to be corrupted by ""bad influences."" In the middle of the night, the son's knee is injured with a hammer and he accuses his younger sister. She claims he was attacked by a cat with a hammer and the father accepts her story. The parents quickly decide that, with Christina no longer available, they should allow the son to choose one of the daughters as a replacement. After fondling both sisters simultaneously in the bath with his eyes closed, he chooses the elder, who is later dressed and prepared by the mother for the sexual encounter. The elder daughter is visibly uncomfortable during intercourse, and afterwards recites a threatening passage from Rocky IV to her brother. The elder daughter's agitation begins to show during the children's dance performance staged for the parents' wedding anniversary. She dances the choreography from Flashdance to exhaustion and then devours her dessert. Later, in the bathroom, she smashes her face with a dumbbell to knock out a dogtooth. Smiling and bloody, she runs undetected through the garden and to the car, where she lets herself into the trunk  and closes it over her. The father discovers her blood and tooth fragments in the sink that night. He runs outside the compound and searches in the tall grass while the other three remain just inside the grounds, barking like dogs on all fours. In the morning, the son and younger daughter hold each other and kiss, while the father drives to work, unwittingly carrying the elder daughter in her hiding place. The father goes inside. The car sits outside, unattended, but the daughter remains in the trunk."

Her job on one film takes her to a small town not far from where her younger sister Bonnie Cusack  lives. Because of the close proximity, Laurie invites Bonnie to come visit her on the set, as she likely won't have time to visit her on her own. Bonnie readily agrees, and during a night of partying, she's picked up by a man in a bar who then tries to rape her at gunpoint. Having been taught some self-defense moves by her sister, Bonnie manages to overpower her attacker and kills him with his own gun. Though the case seems like a sure open-to-shut one of self-defense, Bonnie is shocked when she's charged with murder, as she learns that her attacker was the son of an influential local politician. Because Bonnie is from out of town, she's seen as the troublemaker and convicted on her charges. The judge sentencing her states that while she may have seemed justified by her actions, she cannot take the law into her own hands, and is sentenced to a term in the state prison. Bonnie learns the realities of prison life when she draws the sexual interest of Kay , an influential trustee inmate who soon shows herself to be capable of making life miserable for the youngster. One night Bonnie is touched inappropriately by Kay, and fights back. Bonnie's victory is short-lived, however, as Kay and her gang assault her and inject her with heroin before dumping her over a railing several floors up and to the floor below, resulting in her death. The next day, Laurie is called to claim and identify her sister's body. She sees on the report that her sister had died of a drug overdose, but when she sees her sister's dead and visibly bruised body in the morgue, Laurie concludes that a cover-up is being engineered by the authorities, and is determined to find out the truth. Laurie decides to get arrested and inside the prison herself by intentionally driving drunk. Her efforts succeed, and she gets the same sentencing judge her sister had. However, she is shocked when the judge gives her a suspended sentence because she is a first-time offender. Outraged, Laurie proceeds to insult the judge and attempts to attack him. She is dragged off to jail as the judge revokes her suspension. It doesn't take long for Laurie to realize who's behind her sister's death once on the inside. However, Kay doesn't make the same sexual advances on her as she had her sister. Laurie finally gets Kay's attention by killing Bobo, the first inmate who's part of Kay's gang. Throughout all of this is a subplot involving Miss Dice , a firm but benevolent guard at the prison who is aware of the corrupt circumstances at the prison and in the judicial system, but has little power to do anything about it. When Star, another one of Kay's henchwomen is killed after Laurie cracks her head open in a prison shower, Dice takes an interest in the pattern and asks Kay what's going on. An anguished Kay, who is unaware of Laurie's relationship to Bonnie, claims not to know. Later on, two more of her people die at Laurie's hands, ultimately leaving Kay to face Laurie in a showdown of hand-to-hand combat. Kay is stunned to discover Laurie is the one responsible for the killings and even more so when she reveals that Bonnie was her sister. Kay tells Laurie that Bonnie's death was merely an accident and that she and her cohorts just roughed her up a little. Enraged, Laurie attacks Kay and proceeds to beat her into submission. While the older and heavier Kay is physically stronger and has considerable endurance for her age, she proves to be no match for Laurie's stuntwoman training. Laurie quickly gains the upper hand and proceeds to try and choke Kay to death. But then, Laurie suddenly has an attack of conscience and can't bring herself to kill her. She leaves Kay on the floor and walks away, but Kay recovers and proceeds to chase Laurie through the prison. Kay taunts her the entire time, daring her to stand and fight. This proves to be a mistake as Laurie finally stops running and once again, Kay is soundly thrashed. Just as Laurie defeats Kay, leaving her battered and bloody on the floor, Miss Dice appears, armed with a shotgun and orders them both to stand down. Laurie does so, but then Kay rises up off the floor with a knife, posed to kill Laurie. Miss Dice quickly fires on Kay, gunning her down and saving Laurie. Laurie stares in shock at Kay's body and then back at Miss Dice, who looks back at her with sympathy. ""Did it bring Bonnie back?"" Miss Dice asks Laurie rhetorically, revealing she knew about what Kay and her people had done to her and the reason Laurie had gotten herself imprisoned.

Her job on one film takes her to a small town not far from where her younger sister Bonnie Cusack  lives. Because of the close proximity, Laurie invites Bonnie to come visit her on the set, as she likely won't have time to visit her on her own. Bonnie readily agrees, and during a night of partying, she's picked up by a man in a bar who then tries to rape her at gunpoint. Having been taught some self-defense moves by her sister, Bonnie manages to overpower her attacker and kills him with his own gun. Though the case seems like a sure open-to-shut one of self-defense, Bonnie is shocked when she's charged with murder, as she learns that her attacker was the son of an influential local politician. Because Bonnie is from out of town, she's seen as the troublemaker and convicted on her charges. The judge sentencing her states that while she may have seemed justified by her actions, she cannot take the law into her own hands, and is sentenced to a term in the state prison. Bonnie learns the realities of prison life when she draws the sexual interest of Kay , an influential trustee inmate who soon shows herself to be capable of making life miserable for the youngster. One night Bonnie is touched inappropriately by Kay, and fights back. Bonnie's victory is short-lived, however, as Kay and her gang assault her and inject her with heroin before dumping her over a railing several floors up and to the floor below, resulting in her death. The next day, Laurie is called to claim and identify her sister's body. She sees on the report that her sister had died of a drug overdose, but when she sees her sister's dead and visibly bruised body in the morgue, Laurie concludes that a cover-up is being engineered by the authorities, and is determined to find out the truth. Laurie decides to get arrested and inside the prison herself by intentionally driving drunk. Her efforts succeed, and she gets the same sentencing judge her sister had. However, she is shocked when the judge gives her a suspended sentence because she is a first-time offender. Outraged, Laurie proceeds to insult the judge and attempts to attack him. She is dragged off to jail as the judge revokes her suspension. It doesn't take long for Laurie to realize who's behind her sister's death once on the inside. However, Kay doesn't make the same sexual advances on her as she had her sister. Laurie finally gets Kay's attention by killing Bobo, the first inmate who's part of Kay's gang. Throughout all of this is a subplot involving Miss Dice , a firm but benevolent guard at the prison who is aware of the corrupt circumstances at the prison and in the judicial system, but has little power to do anything about it. When Star, another one of Kay's henchwomen is killed after Laurie cracks her head open in a prison shower, Dice takes an interest in the pattern and asks Kay what's going on. An anguished Kay, who is unaware of Laurie's relationship to Bonnie, claims not to know. Later on, two more of her people die at Laurie's hands, ultimately leaving Kay to face Laurie in a showdown of hand-to-hand combat. Kay is stunned to discover Laurie is the one responsible for the killings and even more so when she reveals that Bonnie was her sister. Kay tells Laurie that Bonnie's death was merely an accident and that she and her cohorts just roughed her up a little. Enraged, Laurie attacks Kay and proceeds to beat her into submission. While the older and heavier Kay is physically stronger and has considerable endurance for her age, she proves to be no match for Laurie's stuntwoman training. Laurie quickly gains the upper hand and proceeds to try and choke Kay to death. But then, Laurie suddenly has an attack of conscience and can't bring herself to kill her. She leaves Kay on the floor and walks away, but Kay recovers and proceeds to chase Laurie through the prison. Kay taunts her the entire time, daring her to stand and fight. This proves to be a mistake as Laurie finally stops running and once again, Kay is soundly thrashed. Just as Laurie defeats Kay, leaving her battered and bloody on the floor, Miss Dice appears, armed with a shotgun and orders them both to stand down. Laurie does so, but then Kay rises up off the floor with a knife, posed to kill Laurie. Miss Dice quickly fires on Kay, gunning her down and saving Laurie. Laurie stares in shock at Kay's body and then back at Miss Dice, who looks back at her with sympathy. ""Did it bring Bonnie back?"" Miss Dice asks Laurie rhetorically, revealing she knew about what Kay and her people had done to her and the reason Laurie had gotten herself imprisoned. ""You have the rest of your life to think about that."" The scene then cuts to the movie's final shot, showing Laurie being picked up from prison by her boyfriend and now living life as a free woman."

Further along the way, something happened to the papers when they stopped at an inn to rest. When Vasyl and Andriy arrive in St. Petersburg they handed over the hramota to the baroness von Likhtenberg who passed them to the empress. The documents did not carry any information and Vasyl had to leave without results. On the way home, both of them decided to shoot each other. As they were saying in unison the Nicene Creed  they heard a voice that identified itself as Kudz coming from a nearby rock saying he was the same chort and the witch turned him into a rock after he helped Vasyl. Kudz asked them to throw him in a nearby marsh so as not to cause any further harm to random travelers on the road. As Vasyl arrived with his friend near their village, Dykanka, they met a little boy who asked them to let him go to see the cossack, Vasyl who had supposedly returned from having seen the empress. Then they arrived and were met by the rest of the village population. Moments later, everybody awaits Vasyl again by his house to tell the story of his rendezvous with the empress. In the last scene, he wishes the little boy to have a loyal horse, an open field, and always be at people's service.

When he goes to pick up some photographs at the local pharmacy, he is taken away and questioned by Michel Beghin  of French naval intelligence. When his negatives had been developed, some of them turned out to be of French military installations. It is discovered that while the camera is the same make as Peter's, the serial number is different. Peter is released on condition that he find out which other hotel guests have cameras like his. Peter does some snooping and eavesdrops on a suspicious conversation between Paul Heimberger  and the hotel's proprietor, Madame Suzanne Koch . He searches Heimberger's room and finds several passports, all with different names and nationalities. Heimberger catches him in the act, but eventually matters are straightened out. Heimberger explains that he was originally a Social Democratic newspaper publisher who was anti-Nazi and been sent to a concentration camp for two years. After he was released, he joined an underground movement against the German regime. Peter spots his camera in the pocket of a dressing-gown belonging to Odette Roux  and Andre , a couple on their honeymoon. Andre first tries to bribe Peter into giving him the negative and, when that fails, threatens him with a pistol. The police arrive at that moment and arrest Peter for espionage. The Rouxs leave the hotel, but find Heimberger trying to disable the hotel's car. Andre shoots him dead and the couple speed off to Toulon, unaware that they are being tracked by the police. Beghin had known the identity of the spies all along and merely used Peter to further his true goal; to find out who the Rouxs are reporting to. The spy ring is captured. Andre gets away, but is caught on a roof by Peter. Andre slips and falls to his death.

Under his leadership, the economy begins to thrive and he assembles a force of government-employed superheroes consisting of Captain Atom, Starfire, Katana, Black Lightning, Power Girl, and Major Force. Meanwhile, Superman and Batman maintain their distrust toward Luthor. The United States government discovers that a massive Kryptonite meteor is hurtling toward Earth. Instead of asking superheroes for aid and wanting to take credit for himself, Lex decides to destroy it with nuclear missiles. Lex arranges a meeting with Superman in Gotham City under the pretense of forming a pact. This results in a battle between the hired Metallo and Superman and Batman. Following the heroes' escape, Metallo is killed by an unknown assailant. Later that night, Lex pins Metallo's murder on Superman, using footage of their battle to implicate him. Lex claims that the radiation being emitted by the meteor affects Superman's judgment, and he places a one-billion-dollar bounty on the Man of Steel's head. While breaking into S.T.A.R. Labs, seeking information on the meteor, Batman and Superman find Metallo's remains and realize that intense radiation has killed him. They are then attacked by an army of villains looking to collect on the bounty. The army includes: Silver Banshee, Captain Cold, Icicle, Killer Frost, Mr. Freeze, Gorilla Grodd, Bane, Black Manta, Black Spider, Brimstone, Catman, Cheetah, Copperhead, Deadshot, Kestrel, King Shark, Brutale, Despero, Giganta, Girder, Lady Shiva, Mongul, Captain Boomerang II, Nightshade, Parasite, Solomon Grundy, and Shrike. After some effort, most of the villains are defeated. The remaining villains are defeated by Captain Atom, who has arrived with Lex's superhero team to arrest Superman. All but Power Girl, whose loyalties are divided, attempt to capture the heroic duo. Superman creates a hurricane using his superspeed, and the two heroes escape with Power Girl. In Metropolis, Power Girl admits that she feels threatened by Lex, and doesn't believe Superman killed Metallo. Lex's superheroes catch up and the fight begins again, this time with Power Girl aiding Superman and Batman. The Dark Knight realizes that Major Force killed Metallo under Luthor's orders and goads him into admitting it in front of everyone. In anger, Power Girl punches him in the stomach with so much force that it ruptures his containment suit. Captain Atom, ashamed at his complicity in Lex's misdeeds, absorbs the energy, disintegrating Major Force and injuring himself in the process. Meanwhile, Lex's missiles fail to stop the meteor due to the sheer amount of radiation being emitted. Amanda Waller discovers that Lex has secretly been taking kryptonite steroids, making him lose whatever rationality he had left. Lex decides to let the meteor hit the Earth so that he may rule what remains behind. Batman and Superman break into Lex's lab to retrieve data on the meteor's radiation. They end up in battle with Captain Marvel and Hawkman, eventually emerging victorious with Power Girl's aid. Though Lex is unwilling to relinquish the data, going so far as to erase it from the lab computers, Waller gives them a copy. Batman and Superman fly off to Tokyo to submit the meteor's data to the Japanese Toyman. Waller tries to have Lex arrested, but he injects himself with more kryptonite steroids and dons a power suit. After escaping Waller and the military, Lex follows Superman and Batman. The Japanese Toyman has built a rocket-propelled spacecraft, intending to use it as a powerful missile to stop the meteor. The ship resembles a giant, robotic composite version of Superman and Batman. With the data, Toyman is able to calculate the necessary reinforcements needed for his own rocket so it won't explode before impact, as Luthor's missiles did. Lex arrives and disables the remote guidance systems. Batman volunteers to fly the ship himself, despite Superman's protests. Though initially faring poorly against Lex and his kryptonite power suit, Superman finally defeats Luthor in the streets of Metropolis in an aerial battle. Batman succeeds in destroying the meteor, and Superman finds him alive and well in an escape pod. With the truth of Metallo's death public knowledge, Superman is cleared of the murder charge and Luthor is arrested, all the while ranting that he, as President, cannot go to prison. Batman then returns to Gotham while the Daily Planets star journalist, Lois Lane, arrives and she and the Man of Steel happily embrace.

After his sister escorts her dad away from the grave, Carty, looking at his watch, starts to run off. Along his way he gets changed into casual clothing and carries on running until he catches a football special train. Aboard the train, he meets the leader of the football firm, John Godden ([[Stephen Graham , an ex-soldier who warns him he has no room for runners in his firm and he best stand his ground. When walking through the train, he meets Elvis , and Carty reminisces about how they met in a series of flashbacks. We learnt that Carty has always been fascinated by The Pack, observing them at Tranmere games when they fight and trying to dress like them, at which point Baby Millan ([[Oliver Lee , taunts Carty and threatens him but Elvis leads the other lads away and Carty stands his ground. Carty eventually meets Elvis at a club night and the pair realise they have many things in common from music taste to wanting out of Birkenhead. The pair fantasise about leaving for Berlin. Carty, over their next few meetings, begs Elvis to introduce him to The Pack but Elvis calls them a ""gang of pricks"" and says Carty does not want to be involved. Eventually, after Carty headbutts a rude sales assistant in a record shop to prove his fighting skills, Elvis gives in and tells him to meet him on the train at 12:00 on Saturday. It fastforwards to on the train again, and The Pack are led by Godden to meet a rival firm. Once there, the two groups scrap and Carty is taken over by a thrill as he is embroiled in the fight. Carty returns home and we discover that his sister knows about his fascination with The Pack. The next day, Carty promises to take her shopping for her birthday in Chester. However, after an argument with Elvis when Elvis tells him he is making a ""twat out of himself"", Carty leaves work to find Elvis there. The pair go for a drink and forget about their argument, and Carty forgets completely about his sister. He promises he will take her out another time the day after, as his mind is firmly on the meet The Pack has when they travel to Wrexham that day. Once there, police attempt to form a barrier between the firms but Carty breaks through and cuts a Wrexham fan with his Stanley - much to the delight of Godden, who finally accepts him as one of The Pack. Everyone toasts Carty on the train home, except Baby Millan and Elvis who are far from happy about his new status. That night at The Pelican, the HQ and chosen pub of The Pack, Carty is ""initiated"" with a girl who he takes outside to have sex with. Once out there, Godden warns Baby Millan to not deal heroin to the members of the firm, warning The Pack cannot have any ""smackheads"". Baby replies ""But its okay for Elvis to do it?"", much to the puzzlement of Godden and the rest of the firm. Outside, Carty does not perform well with the girl, and the lads all rib him for this. Carty and Elvis one night meet two women, Sonia  and Jackie on a bus and take them back to Elvis' bohemian-style flat, which has stars on the wall and a noose to remind him of the ""certainty of death"". Elvis' behaviour becomes erratic as he consumes heroin, and when Carty refuses, Elvis rejects Sonia's advances and plays the guitar instead. Carty, waking up, sees Sonia in the bathroom and the pair have sex. The next day, Elvis and Carty are on their way to another away day when the pair argue in front of Godden. Elvis, taunting Carty's choice of women, is obviously hurt when Carty taunts his performance in bed with the women in front of The Pack. Godden taunts Elvis for possibly being a homosexual. Carty tries to apologise to Elvis as the pair walk in front of The Pack, and Carty spots the opposition firm coming towards them. He yells at the firm and urges The Pack to join them - and Godden does, only briefly, before headbutting Carty and telling him he is the leader of The Pack. Carty's reign as a top boy in the firm is over and Elvis is back to his jovial self on the train home as Carty sulks in the corner. Carty forgets about the Pack for a while and we see him telling his boss, Uncle Bob, that he will go back to college to do his A-Levels. He spends more time with his sister and he urges her to go out one night. In a taxi, Carty meets a pretty girl, Natasha , whom he had previously met in a club. The pair are spending a romantic night in when Carty's sister enters, visibly shaken up. She has been roughed up by a gang of boys and Carty, attempting to sort them out, is beaten up by them too. He recruits the help of Elvis and The Pack . The Pack beat up the gang of lads who roughed up Carty's sister, and Carty finds Elvis crying on the waterfront. Carty thanks him and says he owes Elvis one, but Elvis replies Carty does not owe him anything, and tells Carty ""He always loved you, Carty"". At Godden's funeral, Carty is sitting in the church after everyone leaves when Elvis enters and asks Carty if he will hear his confession. Carty, confused, agrees. Elvis is seen through the confession booth inhaling what appears to be heroin, and he tells Carty to come away with him to Berlin. Carty, currently enjoying a healthy relationship with his family, tells him he cannot yet. Elvis is upset by this, and tells him ""He always loved you Carty"", meaning himself. Elvis asks Carty for one more away day, before leaving. At the final away day, Carty is stood on the station platform waiting for Elvis to meet him yet there is no sign of him. He catches the train just in time and as the train pulls away, Elvis is visible sat on top of a bridge overlooking the track, as the train crosses underneath it, the bridge is covered in smoke and once it clears, Elvis has gone, hinting at suicide. Carty is out of place in The Pack without Elvis and after a final meet with a local firm in which Carty does not get involved, he is cut with a knife by Baby Millan, who calls him a ""ponce"". Carty then turns away from The Pack and walks out of the street, saying ""How long had I waited for this day? Out of here. Out of this."""

She cannot afford the security deposit, but the landlady agrees to accept the first month's rent instead. Samantha needs the apartment because her roommate in her college dormitory is a slob who frequently has sex with her boyfriend all night long. When she sees a flyer advertising a babysitting job, Samantha calls the number and leaves a message on the answering machine. The pay phone rings after she has hung up, and Mr. Ulman  arranges to pick her up outside the Student Affairs office. However, he never shows up. Ulman leaves a message with Samantha's roommate, and when Samantha calls him back, he apologizes for standing her up and offers her $100 to babysit that night. Seeing the money as the only way to afford her first month's rent, Samantha agrees, and her friend Megan  drives her to the house which is in the country. Megan is very skeptical, and begs Samantha to let her stay with her. When they get to the house, Ulman is very evasive when Megan asks him basic questions about who he is. He mentions the evening's lunar eclipse and how the town is the best place on Earth to see it. Eventually, he confesses that there is no child to babysit, only his mother. He agrees to pay Samantha $400, stressing that it was very important to have a sitter for the night. Megan is furious with Samantha for agreeing to stay. She does not trust Ulman, especially once he admitted to lying. As she drives away, she is so flustered that she pulls over to light a cigarette. A man  appears out of nowhere to offer her a light, visibly frightening her. After she lights up, she asks where he came from. He asks, ""You're not the babysitter?"" When she admits that she is not, he unexpectedly kills her by shooting her in the head, then calmly picks the lit cigarette from her fingers to finish it. Back at the house, Ulman promises that his mother is independent enough that Samantha might never even see her, and he mentions twice that there is a phone number on the fridge for a pizza place. Ulman leaves with his wife . Alone, Samantha spends some time going through the many rooms of the house. She decides not to enter one of the rooms, which is shown to have three dead bodies inside. She orders a pizza and plays pool. Eventually, she finds old photographs of the house showing a different family posing in front of it. The discovery unsettles her so much that when the pizza arrives, she throws the money at the delivery man and slams the door. The delivery man is the same stranger who killed Megan. After a few bites of the pizza, she throws it out and tries to wash the taste out of her mouth. At the sink, she hears someone else running a tap somewhere in the house. She goes upstairs to investigate, ending up in the attic, where she becomes frightened by the sounds of someone behind a door. The pizza has been drugged, and Samantha passes out. When she wakes up, she is tied to a satanic altar in the basement. The Ulmans and the stranger are there as well as a deformed priestess, all of them in hooded cloaks. The priestess draws a pentagram on Samantha's belly with blood and then pours more blood down her mouth. Samantha manages to free herself, stabbing Mr. Ulman and poking the stranger in the eye. She runs upstairs and trips over Megan's body in the kitchen. The stranger chases her up to the second story of the house where he shoots her in the arm. As he prepares to finish her off, she slashes his throat and flees into the attic. Mrs. Ulman appears devastated by the death of the man, and enters the attic. She tells Samantha that it is too late to do anything, threatening ""it will work in spite of you"". Samantha stabs her in the back as she prays for help. Samantha dials 911, but when the operator answers, she has another, more powerful hallucination of the demonic looking priestess. Terrified, Samantha flees the house, followed by Mr. Ulman who is bleeding profusely. When he catches up to her, she points the gun at him, and he encourages her to shoot him. He explains that he is simply a messenger for someone else. He asks Samantha to listen to the voices in her head and realize that there is no way to fight them.

She cannot afford the security deposit, but the landlady agrees to accept the first month's rent instead. Samantha needs the apartment because her roommate in her college dormitory is a slob who frequently has sex with her boyfriend all night long. When she sees a flyer advertising a babysitting job, Samantha calls the number and leaves a message on the answering machine. The pay phone rings after she has hung up, and Mr. Ulman  arranges to pick her up outside the Student Affairs office. However, he never shows up. Ulman leaves a message with Samantha's roommate, and when Samantha calls him back, he apologizes for standing her up and offers her $100 to babysit that night. Seeing the money as the only way to afford her first month's rent, Samantha agrees, and her friend Megan  drives her to the house which is in the country. Megan is very skeptical, and begs Samantha to let her stay with her. When they get to the house, Ulman is very evasive when Megan asks him basic questions about who he is. He mentions the evening's lunar eclipse and how the town is the best place on Earth to see it. Eventually, he confesses that there is no child to babysit, only his mother. He agrees to pay Samantha $400, stressing that it was very important to have a sitter for the night. Megan is furious with Samantha for agreeing to stay. She does not trust Ulman, especially once he admitted to lying. As she drives away, she is so flustered that she pulls over to light a cigarette. A man  appears out of nowhere to offer her a light, visibly frightening her. After she lights up, she asks where he came from. He asks, ""You're not the babysitter?"" When she admits that she is not, he unexpectedly kills her by shooting her in the head, then calmly picks the lit cigarette from her fingers to finish it. Back at the house, Ulman promises that his mother is independent enough that Samantha might never even see her, and he mentions twice that there is a phone number on the fridge for a pizza place. Ulman leaves with his wife . Alone, Samantha spends some time going through the many rooms of the house. She decides not to enter one of the rooms, which is shown to have three dead bodies inside. She orders a pizza and plays pool. Eventually, she finds old photographs of the house showing a different family posing in front of it. The discovery unsettles her so much that when the pizza arrives, she throws the money at the delivery man and slams the door. The delivery man is the same stranger who killed Megan. After a few bites of the pizza, she throws it out and tries to wash the taste out of her mouth. At the sink, she hears someone else running a tap somewhere in the house. She goes upstairs to investigate, ending up in the attic, where she becomes frightened by the sounds of someone behind a door. The pizza has been drugged, and Samantha passes out. When she wakes up, she is tied to a satanic altar in the basement. The Ulmans and the stranger are there as well as a deformed priestess, all of them in hooded cloaks. The priestess draws a pentagram on Samantha's belly with blood and then pours more blood down her mouth. Samantha manages to free herself, stabbing Mr. Ulman and poking the stranger in the eye. She runs upstairs and trips over Megan's body in the kitchen. The stranger chases her up to the second story of the house where he shoots her in the arm. As he prepares to finish her off, she slashes his throat and flees into the attic. Mrs. Ulman appears devastated by the death of the man, and enters the attic. She tells Samantha that it is too late to do anything, threatening ""it will work in spite of you"". Samantha stabs her in the back as she prays for help. Samantha dials 911, but when the operator answers, she has another, more powerful hallucination of the demonic looking priestess. Terrified, Samantha flees the house, followed by Mr. Ulman who is bleeding profusely. When he catches up to her, she points the gun at him, and he encourages her to shoot him. He explains that he is simply a messenger for someone else. He asks Samantha to listen to the voices in her head and realize that there is no way to fight them.

A skilled ninja seeks to end the bloodshed these demons inflict upon humanity, but to do this he must fight against his undead former best friend and fellow ninja who was killed in battle and has been resurrected to serve the Yōma.  The first part begins after what appears to be a fierce battle, with several ninja from the Takeda clan retrieving weapons from their fallen comrades and enemies. Two of these ninjas, Hikage and Marou, are observing the process until Marou begins acting strangely. He almost attacks Hikage before returning to normal, seemingly shocked and frightened by what he has just done. The pair make their way back to the Takeda camp. That night, the clan leader, Shingen Takeda, is attacked and killed by a yōma. Shortly thereafter, Hikage learns from a Chunin that Marou has deserted the Takeda and is at risk of exposing Shingen's death to other countries. He is ordered to track down Marou and eliminate him before word can get out, the Chunin warning him to show no mercy towards his former friend. On his journey, Hikage is attacked by a pair of Iga ninja but quickly defeats them. Later while by a waterfall, Hikage reminisces about his childhood with Marou. He is brought out of his thoughts by an old man who is ""waiting to read his last rights"". At the old shrine that the priest takes him to, he explains on how people who have lost the will to live go to commit suicide by drowning themselves in the river and how he is there to appease their souls. Knowing nothing of Marou's whereabouts, the priest advises that Hikage go to the village near the temple, as the sun will be setting soon. He takes the advice and heads to the village, encountering a young woman with a large scar on her cheek along the way. The woman, who reveals her name to be Aya, takes Hikage to the village and introduces him to several of the villagers, most prominently Taichi; a cheerful man who enjoys drinking and partying, and Ito; a woman with a suspicious air about her. During one of the villagers' parties, Hikage spots Marou for a brief instant, but is unable to find him in the following days. He hears from Aya about how none of the people who live in the village, including herself, know where they came from or what they were doing before their arrival and how Hikage will soon be the same. Nevertheless, Hikage continues to look for Marou, all the while being stalked by what he believes to be hunter ninjas. On one of the nights, he meets with the hunters to elaborate on why he is staying in the village. They allow him to continue investigating the village, but remind him that he must show no mercy towards Marou. Another day passes and Hikage sees Aya suffering from a nightmare. He hugs her in order to comfort her, but immediately hears screaming coming from the forest. He rushes to find Taichi and one of the hunters dead, their chests having been ripped open and most of their entrails devoured. A spider yōma attacks, but Hikage uses shuriken to drive it away, whilst seeing a brief vision of Marou. Before dying, the other hunter reveals that Marou is a ""child born of the ground"" and how everyone in their village knew about it, but never discussed it. Left with this mystery, Hikage confronts Aya with Taichi's death, only for her to deny it. She explains to him that it is not unusual for a current resident of the village to vanish when a new person arrives. When she goes to her house to store some water, she hears Ito's voice asking her to do her a favor. Hikage goes down to the riverbank to find that the bodies of Taichi and the hunters, along with the bloodstains and weapons, have disappeared without explanation. At night, Hikage hears Aya singing unusually late and goes to investigate. He finds Aya being held in a different spider yōma's mandibles and attacks it. It drops Aya, but soon runs away with Hikage in pursuit. He arrives at the temple and finds the priest from before. He tells him that he is the spider yōma from the other night and how he is erasing the villager's memories in order to ripen them for Kikuga no Miko's, the demon lord of the land, revival. The two have a short battle during which Hikage kills him after being taunted into doing so. As Hikage walks up the temple's stairs, Aya wakes up and remembers how she got her scar, the priest's spell having worn off when he died. She throws herself into the river to drown. Hikage finds a seemingly uncontious Ito and rushes to her aide. This proves to be a mistake as Ito reveals herself to be a yōma as well. Restraining Hikage with wavy demonic hair, Ito elaborates on how Kikuga no Miko's resurrection is close at hand. Hikage uses some gunpowder bombs to get her to let go, briefly knocking her out. She soon regains consciousness and turns into the spider that kidnapped Aya. Hikage is able to take her down permanently and enters the shrine, demanding that Kikuga show himself. He destroys the buddha statue to reveal an egg that he quickly cuts open. The egg opens to reveal Marou feasting on Taichi's severed head. He growls as Hikage approaches, causing the entire building to crash down. Outside, a fully dressed Marou walks away, giving the broken building a final glance before departing. The next morning it is pouring rain. Reflecting on the night's events, Hikage suddenly remembers Aya and finds her body in the river. He crys silently upon realizing that she has died. Later when the storm lets up, Hikage returns to the village to find it wrecked and all of the inhabitants dead. An acquaintance of his, Kazami, arrives and tells Hikage that the Oda and Uesugi clans have found out about Shingen's death and that he does not need to pursue Marou anymore. Despite this, due to feeling guilt over not being able to save Aya and still seeking answers to why Marou betrayed their clan and became a yōma, Hikage leaves to continue his quest in search for his old friend.  Two years have passed since Hikage traveled to the west in pursuit of Marou, yet he has not had any leads on his whereabouts. While on a beach, a kunoichi spots him and identifies him as a ninja. A group of ninja from the Kōga clan, lead by Shiranui, attacks the girl, demanding to know why she killed their leader. She denies having anything to do with it, and soon Hikage ends up fighting them as well. They kill two of the Kōga and injure one of Shiranui's eyes. Shiranui stumbles into the ocean and is trampled to death by Majumi no Miko, the demon lord of the sea. Hikage asks for Marou's whereabouts, only for Majumi to tell him that he should realize who his childhood friend really is by now. Angered, Hikage attacks Majumi and barely manages to kill him while in the water. Meanwhile, Marou converses with Shiratsuyu, a snake yōma, on what to do about the war between the Oda and Takeda clans. Marou orders Shiratsuyu to kill Hikage while he turns Mikawa into a ""living hell"". The kunoichi travels with Hikage to a nearby village that has seemingly been untouched by the war. Revealing her name to be Aya, sharing the same name as the woman who Hikage failed to protect two years ago, she goes to one of the villager's huts to ask if they can spend the night there. She screams in horror when she sees that the baby has no head and soon the entire village reveals itself to be dead, yet still walking. Hikage says that it is a procession of the dead before the undead all vanish. The village is shown to be in ruins and the two spend the night in a wrecked hut. The next day, Hikage leaves Aya behind and continues his search. He runs into and battles Shiratsuyu, along with Mai, a female butterfly yōma, and a tree yōma, Yoki. Meanwhile, Aya, upset that Hikage left her behind, encounters Kotone, the spirit of a woman who says that she was killed by her lover. They talk briefly before Yoki grabs and holds them hostage in front of Hikage. With some difficulty, Hikage slays Mai and Yoki and Shiratsuyu is possessed by Kotone and vanishes. After traveling for a while, Hikage brings up how suspicious it is that no yōma have attacked them since the fight with Shiratsuyu. While they discuss the war, Kazami appears before Hikage and attacks him, saying that he was ordered by Katsuyori Takeda, the Takeda clan's new head, to borrow the power of the yōma and the only way that Kikuga will help them is if they kill Hikage. Kazami strikes at him, but hesitates and is mortally wounded by Hikage as a result. He uses his last words to tell Hikage that he does not wish to kill him and that Katsuyori is insane for asking the yōma for power. As it turns out, Marou only told the Takeda that he would help them in order to create more hatred and grudges when the final battle at Mount Nigashino. During which the entire Takeda clan was decimated by the Oda, leaving Hikage no home to return to."

A skilled ninja seeks to end the bloodshed these demons inflict upon humanity, but to do this he must fight against his undead former best friend and fellow ninja who was killed in battle and has been resurrected to serve the Yōma.  The first part begins after what appears to be a fierce battle, with several ninja from the Takeda clan retrieving weapons from their fallen comrades and enemies. Two of these ninjas, Hikage and Marou, are observing the process until Marou begins acting strangely.

That night, the clan leader, Shingen Takeda, is attacked and killed by a yōma. Shortly thereafter, Hikage learns from a Chunin that Marou has deserted the Takeda and is at risk of exposing Shingen's death to other countries. He is ordered to track down Marou and eliminate him before word can get out, the Chunin warning him to show no mercy towards his former friend. On his journey, Hikage is attacked by a pair of Iga ninja but quickly defeats them. Later while by a waterfall, Hikage reminisces about his childhood with Marou.

Across the yard is the neighboring men's prison, where General Jonathan Krantz  and Theodore ""T-Bag"" Bagwell  are being held. Receiving word of Sara's incarceration, Krantz puts out a $100,000 bounty on Sara's head. Sara is quickly poisoned with strychnine, but is given medical treatment in the infirmary that saves her life and pregnancy. The correctional physician informs her that she will have thirty minutes with her baby when she eventually gives birth before the baby is taken away from her. His advice is to consider herself to be a surrogate mother to her own fetus so as to avoid crippling depression due to the inevitable separation. Michael learns of the poisoning from Sara's lawyer. After learning about the bounty on her head, he decides that he must break her out. He once again enlists Lincoln Burrows  and Fernando Sucre's  help. Lincoln and Sucre stake out the prison, taking measurements and photographs of the cameras and creating a rough layout of the prison. Gretchen sees Lincoln and Sucre, and forces Sara to include her in any escape plan that may be developing. After meticulously analyzing the photographs and plans of the prison, Michael finds a fault in the security system. Alexander Mahone  then arrives and offers his aid, although his true intentions are unclear, as he had just been offered reinstatement with the FBI on the condition that he find and report any evidence incriminating Michael. Michael exploits the fault to come up with an escape plan, which he relays to Sara using a hidden message written in a letter. While he is out however, FBI Agent Todd Wheatley  breaks into Michael's apartment, and sees the plans laid out on table. When Michael arrives, he points out that the plans look very incriminating, but Michael claims that he was merely looking for any faults, so that he could describe them to the prison warden , in the hopes that she may grant him visitation rights. Visitation rights are eventually granted, so Michael visits Sara and, because the visit is supervised, subtly asks her if she understood the hidden message, which she implies that she does. However, just after leaving the prison, Michael finds out that Agent Wheatley also discovered the fault which Michael planned to exploit, and sees the camera system being adjusted, putting a halt to the escape plan. Meanwhile, Sara joins the ""family"" of the leader of the prisoners, an inmate who goes by the name of ""Daddy"" , in order to join the work detail and gain access to the yard. Michael soon comes up with a daring plan which Lincoln strongly recommends against, to somehow parachute right outside the Prison Yard and rescue Sara. Realizing the difficulty of such a task, Michael asks Lincoln to enlist the aid of T-Bag. Since T-Bag would clearly be holding a grudge against Michael, Michael tells Lincoln to offer him a reward of $5,000. During the meeting, T-Bag demands more money than the brothers can provide. But, since the General refused to provide any financial incentive for T-Bag's help, T-Bag tells Lincoln how he can rob the man  holding the General's $100,000, in exchange for his help. Lincoln agrees to steal the money, and tells T-Bag to start a fire in his cell at an exact time. Lincoln and Sucre then proceed to rob the money holder and set up the fund transfer to T-Bag. Wanting to get to Sara, Gretchen persuades one of the guards to search Daddy's room. The guards do so, and, finding drugs in the trash can, take Daddy to lockup. While waiting near the showers, Sara is attacked by a fellow family member  but Gretchen comes to her rescue, killing the attacker in the process. Gretchen then pleads with Sara to include her in the escape because she wishes to see her daughter, Emily, and give her a gift. When one of the guards tells Daddy of the death of her family member, and mentions that Sara and Gretchen are thought to be behind her killing, Daddy becomes infuriated. Following several phone calls with Agent Wheatley, in which Mahone divulged Michael's parachute plot, it appears that Mahone has betrayed Michael. But Michael continues to trust him, and gives him a piece of paper and a DVD which he says to give to Sara, in the event of his death. Michael then visits Sara once more, telling her that the previous escape plan was now impossible. But he cryptically tells her of a new plan, in which she must get to the chapel, which is linked to the outside via an underground connection to an administrative building. Daddy is eventually freed from lockup, and appears to be stalking Sara and Gretchen. Just before the escape begins, Gretchen distracts a guard, and Sara confronts Daddy. Following a short explanation, Sara picks a fight with Daddy and purposely pushes her into a powerful and frightening inmate , who then retaliates by attacking Daddy. At the same time, Gretchen punches the guard and knocks her to the ground, but gets stabbed in the leg during the altercation. Sara quickly grabs the guard's keys, and the two of them hide in the kitchen amidst the chaos. Michael then begins the escape. Knowing of the plan thanks to Mahone's information, agent Wheatley orders all lights to be shut off, and positions armed officers near Michael's landing site. When the parachute lands, it is riddled with bullets. However, Wheatley discovers the parachutist is revealed to be a dummy. Michael is then seen sneaking out from under Wheatley's car and running into the prison. With the escape underway, Gretchen admits to Sara that she cannot continue on without help due to her injuries. Gretchen then asks her to choose, either to leave her behind or help her. Sara chooses to help Gretchen because she rescued her during the attack. However, as they run to the chapel, Gretchen is spotted by guards. She is asked if she's alone but Gretchen refuses to divulge Sara's presence and stalls the guards by telling them she just wanted to be with her daughter. Though Sara is almost spotted by a guard, she manages to unlock the door and get into the chapel. At this point the guards are recalled and Gretchen is again taken into custody. Sara then sees the necklace that Gretchen made for her daughter on the ground, and knowing that she got away thanks to Gretchen, picks it up so that she may pass it on to her daughter. Michael finally meets with Sara, and they sit, waiting. Sucre is supposed to transfer the money to T-Bag's bank account, but sees that the bank is closed. When T-Bag finds out that the transfer did not take place as promised, he angrily reveals the plot to the warden, and tells her that he was instructed to pull the fire alarm. The warden responds by turning all fire alarms off. This however, turns out to be part of Michael's plan, as he figured that T-Bag would reveal the plan. With the alarms off, he then burns through a locked door with a blowtorch, managing to force it open. However, when they try to escape through the next door, which is electronically locked, they discover a roadblock. Knowing that this was a possibility from the beginning, Michael asks Sara to run as soon as the door opens and leave him behind, since the only way to open the door is to manually cause a power surge that will certainly kill him. Sara refuses to leave if Michael cannot go with her, but he emphasizes that there is no other way, touching her stomach and saying that he will be going with her. In one final act of sacrifice, Michael causes the surge, and sparks are shown coming from the fuse box. Sara then runs out, with Lincoln, Sucre, and Mahone waiting with a van just outside. Stunned, Sara is unable to describe to Lincoln what just happened. Mahone, who purposely misled the agents, revealed that he knew of Michael's plan from a previous discussion, and simply tells Lincoln, ""he's gone"". They get into the van and drive away, still shocked over Michael's fate. Back at the prison, T-Bag is put into solitary confinement for aiding Sara's escape since he told the warden to shut off the fire alarms. Mahone finally gives Sara the paper and the DVD which Michael left for her. The paper reveals a medical exam which Michael recently underwent, revealing that his brain tumor had returned, and that his condition was terminal. Finally, Lincoln and Sara sit in a boat, and view the DVD. It is a prerecorded message Michael made right before Sara's escape. In the video, he tells Sara and Lincoln that he wouldn't have had much time to live because of his tumor and that he doesn't regret his choice. He asks Lincoln to make a promise that he will always be there for his child  no matter what and asks Sara to watch out for Lincoln. He says that life is wasted on what people want to, but don't ever say and takes this moment to say what he wants which is that he loves them both. He tells them to make sure his son is told every day how much he is loved and how lucky he is to be free. The video, and the entire series, ends with Scofield's message that they are finally free: {{cquote}}"

Across the yard is the neighboring men's prison, where General Jonathan Krantz  and Theodore ""T-Bag"" Bagwell  are being held. Receiving word of Sara's incarceration, Krantz puts out a $100,000 bounty on Sara's head. Sara is quickly poisoned with strychnine, but is given medical treatment in the infirmary that saves her life and pregnancy. The correctional physician informs her that she will have thirty minutes with her baby when she eventually gives birth before the baby is taken away from her. His advice is to consider herself to be a surrogate mother to her own fetus so as to avoid crippling depression due to the inevitable separation. Michael learns of the poisoning from Sara's lawyer. After learning about the bounty on her head, he decides that he must break her out. He once again enlists Lincoln Burrows  and Fernando Sucre's  help. Lincoln and Sucre stake out the prison, taking measurements and photographs of the cameras and creating a rough layout of the prison. Gretchen sees Lincoln and Sucre, and forces Sara to include her in any escape plan that may be developing. After meticulously analyzing the photographs and plans of the prison, Michael finds a fault in the security system. Alexander Mahone  then arrives and offers his aid, although his true intentions are unclear, as he had just been offered reinstatement with the FBI on the condition that he find and report any evidence incriminating Michael. Michael exploits the fault to come up with an escape plan, which he relays to Sara using a hidden message written in a letter. While he is out however, FBI Agent Todd Wheatley  breaks into Michael's apartment, and sees the plans laid out on table. When Michael arrives, he points out that the plans look very incriminating, but Michael claims that he was merely looking for any faults, so that he could describe them to the prison warden , in the hopes that she may grant him visitation rights. Visitation rights are eventually granted, so Michael visits Sara and, because the visit is supervised, subtly asks her if she understood the hidden message, which she implies that she does. However, just after leaving the prison, Michael finds out that Agent Wheatley also discovered the fault which Michael planned to exploit, and sees the camera system being adjusted, putting a halt to the escape plan. Meanwhile, Sara joins the ""family"" of the leader of the prisoners, an inmate who goes by the name of ""Daddy"" , in order to join the work detail and gain access to the yard. Michael soon comes up with a daring plan which Lincoln strongly recommends against, to somehow parachute right outside the Prison Yard and rescue Sara. Realizing the difficulty of such a task, Michael asks Lincoln to enlist the aid of T-Bag. Since T-Bag would clearly be holding a grudge against Michael, Michael tells Lincoln to offer him a reward of $5,000. During the meeting, T-Bag demands more money than the brothers can provide. But, since the General refused to provide any financial incentive for T-Bag's help, T-Bag tells Lincoln how he can rob the man  holding the General's $100,000, in exchange for his help.

After being an absolute nuisance to all of the other engines by bossing them around, Thomas challenges Spencer to a contest of strength, taking heavy cargo around the island. Thomas's brakes fail after climbing a tall hill, and he runs out of control through an overgrown, abandoned line. There, Thomas finds Patchwork Hiro, an old abandoned engine from a faraway land . Hiro does not want to be found out by the Fat Controller, fearing he will be scrapped, so Thomas promises to keep him his secret and work to make Patchwork Hiro ""Master of the Railway"" once again. Later, he's taken to the Sodor Steamworks for repairs, where he finds old parts for Hiro. He takes them with permission from Victor, the Steamworks engine, only to discover that Hiro's hiding place is dangerously close to the Duke and Duchess's new summer house. The following day, he tells Percy about Patchwork Hiro, and asks Percy to do his own job while he helps Hiro. Percy misplaces his own mail trucks and breaks down while doing Thomas's job, so Thomas brings him to the Steamworks. The Fat Controller finds out about this and scold Thomas by forcing him to do Percy's work. With nobody else to ask for help, Thomas tells the rest of his friends about Hiro. They all work together in bringing Hiro new parts, distracting Spencer, and keeping the operation a secret from the Fat Controller while Thomas and Percy try to find the missing mail trucks. Patchwork Hiro makes friends with all of the engines, but gradually grows homesick. On the day that the last necessary part for Hiro is to be delivered, Spencer discovers Percy's mail trucks, only to be cornered by Thomas, James and Toby. The Fat Controller accuses Spencer of stealing the trucks and demands him to return them to Percy. While Thomas and Hiro wait for Percy with the last part, they hear Spencer's whistle and run. Spencer finds them and gives chase, but without the last part, Hiro falls apart and is forced to a stop. Spencer is suddenly distracted by Gordon while Thomas moves Hiro to a new hiding place. The Duke and Duchess are furious with Spencer for abandoning his own work, and Thomas asks to assist him, in order to keep his eye on Spencer and to gain the trust of the Fat Controller. Meanwhile, the other engines visit Hiro to keep his spirits up. When Thomas finally decides to tell the Fat Controller about Hiro, Spencer tries to stop him, but he is foiled by a rickety bridge which collapses beneath him. When Thomas explains Hiro's situation to the Fat Controller, he reassures Thomas that he would never have scrapped the ""Master of the Railway"", and the following day, Thomas and Percy bring him to the Steamworks. There, Victor and his assistant, Kevin work together to restore Hiro. Once he's as good as new, Hiro rescues Spencer, and they work with Thomas on the summerhouse. Spencer apologizes to the two engines, saying they are ""both fine engines and fine friends."" Hiro misses his home island, so the Fat Controller arranges for Hiro to return home. A farewell party is held at the docks, and Thomas promises Hiro that Sodor will always be his home too."

Before landing, Barendos stops at moonbase and warns the two officials that, in case of his success, they will be both dismissed and killed. This situation explains why during the movie, Barendos doesn't receive support from Vega forces on moonbase. Barendos arrives on earth and captures Duke Fleed's closest ally, Koji Kabuto. While under a mind control in captivity, Koji reveals the history and location of both Mazinger Z and Great Mazinger. The Vega Empire seized the opportunity to capture the Great Mazinger and forcing Duke and his Grendizer to do battle against the formidable Great Mazinger. Grendizer and Great Mazinger clash in battle until Grendizer manages to deactivate Great Mazinger using a special shot, suggested by Koji. Also starring in this movie are three exclusive saucer beasts named Jinjin, Gubigubi, and Koakoa that also battle Grendizer only to be easily defeated. The Movie is based on several ideas featured in UFO Robo Grendizer Manga by Go Nagai, Especially from Chapter 5. Captain Barandos made an appearance and stole Great Mazinger from it's hangar, and used it to fight Grendizer with the help of 3 other saucer beasts, similar to the movie. Also, in the Chapter 4 of the manga Mazinger Z and Great Mazinger have been stolen to fight Grendizer together, which Grendizer had tough time fighting both. {{Expand section}}

During their celebration at a rented lake house, their coach, Buzzer  encourages them to live their lives in a similar way to how they played the game. Thirty years later, the five friends, who had remained close companions up until their graduation, have since separated. Lenny Feder  is a high-powered Hollywood talent agent who is married to Roxanne Chase , a fashion designer, and has three children. His two sons, Greg and Keithie  have become very spoiled much to his annoyance. Eric Lamonsoff ([[Kevin James  claims he is now a co-owner of a lawn furniture company, is married to Sally  and has two children, Donna and Bean . Much to Eric's chagrin, Bean continues to nurse on Sally. Kurt McKenzie  is a stay-at-home father who is married to Deanne , the primary breadwinner of the family, and has two kids, Andre and Charlotte . Deanne is pregnant with another child and her mother  also lives with the family. Rob Hilliard  has been divorced three times and has daughters Jasmine, Amber, and Bridget  from those marriages. His current wife, Gloria , is 30 years older than him. Marcus Higgins  is a lazy womanizer. All five friends regularly harass with each other in comedic fashion throughout the film: Lenny for being rich; Eric for being overweight; Kurt for being skinny and not being more useful; Rob for his way of saying ""Maize!"" and for having a much older wife; and Marcus for being a slacker. When the five friends soon find out that Buzzer has died, they all return to New England with their families to attend his private funeral. Lenny rents the lake house for the 4th of July weekend for his friends to stay at, but Lenny cannot stay for the whole weekend because Roxanne has a fashion show in Milan. While at the lake house, Lenny is annoyed that their kids would rather play video games than spend time outdoors, so he and the others force their kids to play outside during their stay. Eric has a small incident on a rope swing and injures a bird. At a local restaurant, Lenny runs into his old nemesis, Dickie Bailey , who is still upset at Lenny because he allegedly had his foot out of bounds when he made the long-ago game winning shot. Dickie challenges him and his friends to a rematch, but Lenny declines, noting that Dickie is decidedly out of shape. The next day, the five friends spread Buzzer's ashes. Rob becomes depressed during this event, lamenting his failed marriages, and later says his three daughters from the past marriages are coming. After having to deal with Jasmine, Rob goes and hangs out with his friends, who were fishing. After making some jokes on Rob, the others elect to cheer him up with a game of arrow roulette. Rob remains in the circle the longest, making him the winner. His thrill of victory is cut short as the falling arrow impales his foot. That evening, Lenny discovers the kids talking on cup phones and Roxanne accidentally tells Becky that she is the ""Tooth Fairy"". Happy that they are enjoying the same kind of fun he had as a child, Lenny installs an extensive cup-phone network in the house. Roxanne ultimately figures out that it is more important to stay at the lake house than going to Milan. The five friends later go to a water park. There, Bean learns to drink milk out of a carton, while Marcus flirts constantly with Jasmine and Amber, having bought them skimpy bikinis. Rob assaults a ride attendant who insults Bridget for being less attractive than her sisters. Eric ignores Donna's warning about a chemical in the kiddie pool that turns urine blue, and chaos results when he makes a sissy in the pool. Later, the other friends and Eric pee in the pool and the water turns blue. Later, Lenny and the group go to the zip line and meet Dickie again, this time with his own group of friends, including Wiley , who ends up in the hospital after an accident. Lenny teaches his son how to shoot a perfect shot and the guys end the night by sharing a dance with their wives. The next day, Roxanne picks up Lenny's phone, then confronts him on lying about canceling their flight trip before she agreed on staying for the family instead of going to Milan. Eventually, everyone starts to tell the truth about their feelings and lives. On their final day at the lake house, Lenny and his buddies are challenged again to a basketball rematch by Dickie. At the game-deciding shot, Lenny purposely misses in order to allow Dickie to finally win. Before the end of the film, Marcus plays another game of arrow roulette, this time with an entire crowd of people, and everyone takes off, with Wiley accidentally getting his foot impaled by the arrow."

Several years ago, Man-sik, a Haeundae local, lost Yeon-hee's father due to his mistake in the 2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake while deep-sea fishing together at the Indian Ocean. Because of this, for years, Man-sik wasn't able to become involved with Yeon-hee, who runs an unlicensed seafood restaurant, despite her attempts to start a relationship . Dong-choon, another Haeundae local and also a neighbor of Man-sik, teams up with Man-sik's son and gets involved with some 'illegal' activity to earn money, but the two end up getting caught by the police. Afterwards, Dong-choon's mother, concerned about her unemployed son, decides to prepare him for a job interview, but Dong-choon refuses. As time passes, Man-sik finally plans to propose to Yeon-hee on a night with fireworks. Geologist Kim Hwi somehow runs into his divorced wife, Yoo-jin, who is preparing for an expo in Busan. Although Yoo-jin has a daughter , they decide not to tell their daughter that he  is her real father, afraid that the child would be greatly shocked. A wealthy college student from Seoul, Hee-mi, accidentally falls into the ocean from a luxurious yacht. Hyeong-sik, Man-sik's younger brother and also a lifeguard, rescues Hee-mi rather 'violently'. Hee-mi becomes greatly angered by the 'violent' rescue and annoys him by following him around. But as time passes on, love starts to grow between them. During the fireworks, Man-sik proposes to Yeon-hee. Yeon-hee says that a ribbon hung outside her restaurant the day after would mean 'yes'. On the day after, Man-sik sees no ribbon, and he meets Dong-choon, who was nearby. Dong-choon tells Man-sik that he told Yeon-hee why her father died several years ago. Man-sik becomes very angry, for he thinks that what Dong-choon told Yeon-hee caused there to be no ribbon. Meanwhile, Hwi notices that the Sea of Japan  is displaying similar activity to the Indian Ocean at the time of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. The Disaster Prevention Agency assures him that Korea is at no risk, but a megatsunami soon forms near Japan and starts to travel at 500 miles per hour towards Haeundae. Hwi realizes that the citizens of Haeundae have only 10 minutes left to escape. There is a short earthquake in Haeundae; the elevator Yoo-jin is in stops perhaps due to the earthquake. The sea starts receding from the shore, causing mass hysteria on the beaches as people realize that a tsunami is coming.

Several years ago, Man-sik, a Haeundae local, lost Yeon-hee's father due to his mistake in the 2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake while deep-sea fishing together at the Indian Ocean. Because of this, for years, Man-sik wasn't able to become involved with Yeon-hee, who runs an unlicensed seafood restaurant, despite her attempts to start a relationship . Dong-choon, another Haeundae local and also a neighbor of Man-sik, teams up with Man-sik's son and gets involved with some 'illegal' activity to earn money, but the two end up getting caught by the police. Afterwards, Dong-choon's mother, concerned about her unemployed son, decides to prepare him for a job interview, but Dong-choon refuses. As time passes, Man-sik finally plans to propose to Yeon-hee on a night with fireworks. Geologist Kim Hwi somehow runs into his divorced wife, Yoo-jin, who is preparing for an expo in Busan. Although Yoo-jin has a daughter , they decide not to tell their daughter that he  is her real father, afraid that the child would be greatly shocked. A wealthy college student from Seoul, Hee-mi, accidentally falls into the ocean from a luxurious yacht. Hyeong-sik, Man-sik's younger brother and also a lifeguard, rescues Hee-mi rather 'violently'. Hee-mi becomes greatly angered by the 'violent' rescue and annoys him by following him around. But as time passes on, love starts to grow between them. During the fireworks, Man-sik proposes to Yeon-hee. Yeon-hee says that a ribbon hung outside her restaurant the day after would mean 'yes'. On the day after, Man-sik sees no ribbon, and he meets Dong-choon, who was nearby. Dong-choon tells Man-sik that he told Yeon-hee why her father died several years ago. Man-sik becomes very angry, for he thinks that what Dong-choon told Yeon-hee caused there to be no ribbon. Meanwhile, Hwi notices that the Sea of Japan  is displaying similar activity to the Indian Ocean at the time of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. The Disaster Prevention Agency assures him that Korea is at no risk, but a megatsunami soon forms near Japan and starts to travel at 500 miles per hour towards Haeundae. Hwi realizes that the citizens of Haeundae have only 10 minutes left to escape. There is a short earthquake in Haeundae; the elevator Yoo-jin is in stops perhaps due to the earthquake. The sea starts receding from the shore, causing mass hysteria on the beaches as people realize that a tsunami is coming. Thousands of people run for their lives, but the tsunami soon reaches Haeundae and the streets are quickly flooded and many buildings collapse.

13439264The film begins in medias res, with the suspects getting caught and being interrogated. Then it flashes back to three years earlier and the film continues forward from there, interspersed with occasional bits from the interrogation. Three years before getting caught, Bridget Cardigan  lived a comfortable upper middle class life until her husband Don Cardigan  was ""downsized"" from his position and sunk into debt. The paycheck for Selina, the housecleaner, bounces again. Selina confronts Bridget and suggests she take a job as a janitor at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. On her first day on the job, Bridget hatches a scheme to steal worn-out dollar bills slated for destruction. For her team she chooses Nina , who works the dollar bill shredder, and Jackie , who takes bill carts from the Secret Service room to the shredding room. It takes some work to persuade Nina to join, but Jackie joins them quickly. The plan is that in the Secret Service room Bridget will switch a cart's official Master-brand lock with a near identical lock she purchased at Home Depot. Bridget will tell Jackie the cart number and give Nina the official lock. When Jackie gets the chosen cart, she dumps some bills from the cart into a trash can before taking the cart to Nina, who then uses Bridget's key to open it and restores the official lock, and then proceeds to shred the remaining bills. Meanwhile, Bridget, in the course of her janitorial duties, retrieves the dumped bills from the trash and splits them among Nina and Jackie in the women's restroom. Their first robbery is a success though the take is not as big as they had hoped. However, they're emboldened to do it repeatedly. Once Don and Bridget pay off their debt, Don suggests they stop before they get caught. Bridget rejects this idea and persuades Nina and Jackie to keep going. They almost get caught but they end up cutting in Barry, one of the security guards, who is attracted to Nina. A Federal Bank Examiner shows up at a party at Bridget's house, and the next day Bridget sees him at work. The Examiner confronts Glover , who is unwilling to admit anyone has stolen a single bill out of his bank as a matter of professional pride. Tipped off, that night Bridget and her accomplices begin trying to get rid of all the loot stashed in their houses, but the cops move in before all the evidence is destroyed. Bridget escapes but the others get caught. Bridget hires a tax attorney to defend them. The lawyer gets Bridget and all her accomplices off the hook for their crimes, because neither the law enforcement, nor the examiner can prove that the large stash of cash in their homes came from the Federal Reserve Bank. Technically, it isn't illegal to have a couple hundred thousand dollars in cash lying around inside a private residence. However, they spent a large sum of that stolen cash to buy expensive objects and improvements on their houses, and did not pay the taxes for them because they couldn't justify the income. The IRS demands they pay their taxes, which turn out to be equal in amount to the money that still remains. Eight months later, Bridget reveals to Nina and Jackie that she had stashed away much of the stolen money in the basement of a friend's bar.

2266239Leon , a genius, summons five college students to his apartment and challenges them to participate in his latest game creation: The Great All-Nighter. He tells them about his game and instructs them to form teams. At first, the leaders refuse to play. However, rivalries between them lead all five to change their minds by the game's start time. The game works like this: # Teams are given an initial clue to solve. # When the clue is solved, it will lead to a location. # At that location they must find and solve another clue leading to another location and eventually the end. Leon, as ""game master,"" keeps track of the teams locations with a giant map, and various radio equipment. The teams are supposed to call and check in at each clue . Starting at sundown, the five teams meet and are given envelopes with the first clue. They travel around Los Angeles, deciphering new clues in various locations, including the Griffith Observatory, a piano museum, the Pabst Blue Ribbon brewery, a restaurant, a mini golf course, the Los Angeles International Airport, and a video arcade. The first team to reach the final destination, a room in the Westin Bonaventure Hotel, wins the game. The movie focuses mainly on the struggle between the yellow and blue teams. The adventures of the other three teams are subplots, as well as the situation at Leon's apartment . Here, along with his female assistants , Leon monitors the progress of the game. Already unpopular with his landlady, Mrs. Grimhaus, for the amount of noise he makes, Leon faces eviction if any of the other tenants complain. Several of them do show up to complain, but as Leon explains the mechanics of the game to them, they become fascinated with it and help run it, much to the annoyance of Grimhaus. The game culminates in a race-to-the-finish at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel, followed by a huge party.  Teams are made up of characters who are broad stereotypes. They wear matching sweatshirts, and ride in vehicles that also match their team color. *The members of the Yellow Team are all friendly, and kind; they play fair and are the main heroes of the film. The yellow team are led by the protagonist Adam . The Yellow team picks up an additional member, Adam's troubled younger brother Scott , partway through the game, who acts out to get Adam's attention. They also force the shy Flynch , whom Adam has been counseling, to play the game rather than allow him to go on a date with an ugly girl. Also on the team are Laura , Adam's love interest, and Marvin , another friend of Adam's. The team vehicle, owned by Marvin, is often referred to as a Jeep but it is actually a Toyota Land Cruiser. *The members of the Blue Team are all selfish, rude, and unattractive individuals who cheat at every opportunity. They are led by overweight snob Harold , who is intensely jealous of the popular Adam. Melio  purposely instigates fights between Harold and his girlfriend, Lucille, who puts Harold on a diet just before the game starts. ""Blade,"" a Mexican-American who is constantly brandishing his switchblade knife, never speaks. An additional member, Barf , is apparently mentally challenged. The team vehicle is a Chevy van equipped with a computer that can solve clues; however, this device is destroyed early on when Harold hides a stash of marshmallows in the circuitry. *The Green Team, also known as the ""Meat Machine,"" is made up of jocks from the school's football team. They are led by Lavitas ; Dirk Blocker is also on the team. Their antagonism leads both the Red and White teams into playing. The team vehicle is a Volkswagen Beetle named the ""Meat Wagon."" *The White Team is made up of debate team nerds, led by Wesley . The White Team rides matching Puch mopeds which they eventually share with the Red team after their vehicle is destroyed. *The Red Team is made up of four members of an unpopular sorority led by Donna, played by Maggie Roswell. Two of the members are a set of frequently giggling, overweight twins  and the other two are feminists. The Red team's vehicle is a Datsun pickup truck, which is eventually destroyed by the Green team.
1535983The 1919 Chicago White Sox are considered the greatest team in baseball and, in fact, one of the greatest ever assembled to that point. However, the team's owner, Charles Comiskey, is a skinflint with little inclination to reward his players for a spectacular season. When a gamblers gets wind of the players' discontent, it offers a select group of Sox &mdash; including star pitcher Eddie Cicotte &mdash; more money to play badly than they would have earned by winning the World Series against the Cincinnati Reds. A number of players, including Chick Gandil, Swede Risberg, and Lefty Williams, go along with the scheme. The team's greatest star, Shoeless Joe Jackson, is depicted as being not very bright and not entirely sure what is going on. Buck Weaver, meanwhile, is included with the seven others but insists that he wants nothing to do with the fix. When the best-of-nine series begins, Cicotte deliberately pitches poorly to lose the first game. Williams does likewise in Game 2, while Gandil and Hap Felsch make glaring mistakes on the field. Several of the players become upset, however, when the various gamblers involved fail to pay their promised money up front. Chicago journalists Ring Lardner and Hugh Fullerton grow increasingly suspicious. Meanwhile, the team's manager, Kid Gleason, continues to hear rumors of a fix, but he remains confident that his boys will come through in the end. A third pitcher not in on the scam, Dickey Kerr, wins Game 3 for the Sox, making both gamblers and teammates uncomfortable. Other teammates such as Ray Schalk continue to play hard, while Weaver and Jackson show no visible signs of taking a dive. Cicotte, who won 29 games during the season, loses again in Game 4. With the championship now in jeopardy, Gleason intends to bench him from his next start, but Cicotte begs for another chance. The manager reluctantly agrees and is rewarded with a victory in Game 7. Unpaid by the gamblers, Williams also intends to do his best, but when his wife's life is threatened, he purposely pitches badly to lose the final game. Cincinnati wins the World Series  to the shock of Sox fans. Even worse, sportswriter Fullerton exposes the strong possibility that this series was not on the level. His findings cause Comiskey and the other owners to appoint a new commissioner of baseball, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, and give him complete authority over the sport. Eight players are indicted and brought to trial. Cicotte, Williams, and Jackson even sign confessions. But in court, while Weaver maintains his innocence, the confessions are mysteriously found to be stolen, and the popular Chicago players are found not guilty. While they celebrate, however, Judge Landis bans all eight from professional baseball for life, citing their failure to reveal being approached by gambling interests in the first place. Weaver is among those exiled from the game. The final scene shows him in the bleachers of a New Jersey minor league ballpark, watching Jackson play under an assumed name.

1745296An equine farmer discovers dead bodies and is killed by one of the assailants himself. Meanwhile, attackers use special explosives to break into an NSA bunker beneath the equine farm. There, NSA Agent Augustus Gibbons fends off the attackers before barely escaping himself. Lieutenant Alabama ""Bama"" Cobb is later revealed to be responsible for the attack on the bunker. After escaping the attack, Gibbons tells his assistant, Agent Toby Shavers, that the new XXX must be more off the grid than Xander Cage was, in other words, more attitude. So he meets up with Lieutenant Darius Stone who was jailed for 20 years whilst serving in the navy for disobeying orders and breaking General George Deckert's jaw. Later, Gibbons poses as Stone's lawyer and makes a deal with him in prison. Stone, who had been in prison at Leavenworth for assaulting Deckert, makes a daring escape. Stone is later told to recover a hard drive from the NSA bunker, while trying to escape Agent Kyle Steele at the same time, and is rescued by Shavers. Some time later, Gibbons appears to be attacked in his home and murdered, with Deckert covering up the plot. Afterwards, Stone meets up with Gibbons' contact, a beautiful blonde named Charlie Mayweather, to get information and go to her safe house, but is framed so that it will appear that he murdered 3-Star General Jack Pettibone, whom Cobb and Charlie actually killed. The police arrive, and Steele enters the house and makes a deal with Stone, while Shavers later hacks into the NSA to retrieve Deckert's plans. Afterwards, Stone infiltrates Deckert's troops aboard the USS Independence and discovers Gibbons is not dead, but being held prisoner by Deckert. Apparently Deckert is setting them up. Stone is discovered by Charlie . Gibbons orders him to escape and leave him. After retrieving the blueprints of Deckert's plot, Stone gets into an M-2 Bradley Armored Fighting vehicle and fights his way out of the ship, destroying a tank commandeered by Cobb's men to kill him. He briefly converses with the lieutenant and realizes that Deckert is planning a coup. Stone makes contact with Steele and shows him the plans; stating his view that Deckert is plotting to attack the Capitol. Steele counters Stone by insisting that Deckert is guarding the Capitol, not invading it. Stone insists this is a cover, then leaves in frustration with Steele's disbelief. During a conversation with Deckert, Steele realizes Stone was right, because Deckert lets it slip that he knows that Gibbons is still alive. He finds Stone and tells him Deckert wants to kill the president and his successors so that he can take his place. Steele suggests they go off the grid. Stone, Steele, and Shavers enlist the aid of his former gang leader, Zeke, and his crew to fight Deckert's force. Together they rob an 18 wheeler, secretly hauling guns and equipment under the guise of a cheese truck. On the night of Deckert's plan, they make their move, driving though the backs of buildings and warehouses. They end up carjacking a tank , and Stone helps Steele infiltrate the Capitol building. After some gunfights , Deckert, with Cobb, abducts the President while he is making the State of the Union Address. They escape on a bullet train. Stone pursues the bullet train by car and makes it aboard; destroying the car in the process. He engages Cobb in hand-to-hand combat and finally kills him by causing an explosion. Stone fights Deckert while helping the president escape in an adjacent helicopter. Stone leaps from the fleeing train while Gibbons destroys it with a missile, obliterating Deckert. The flaming wreckage from the train lights Stone in a silhouette as he dives into the river below, narrowly avoiding the wreckage that plunges in after him. The President awards Agent Steele and the Unknown Soldier  the Medal of Honor, as Stone goes back to his thug-esque lifestyle. Deckert receives full honors at his funeral, somewhat to Stone's disgust. He and Lola part with her, leaving him the Mustang, and he drives off; the xXx tattoo can be seen on the back of his neck. In the now rebuilt NSA Headquarters, Gibbons, Steele and Shavers discuss what kind of person the next xXx agent should be; farther off the grid, a fresh face, a new model. Gibbons says that he has the perfect candidate.

16266637The great detective Sherlock Holmes and his trusted companion Dr. John Watson travel to New York City to investigate a recent threat made by Professor Moriarty. During their investigation, Holmes and Watson are reunited with their old acquaintance Irene Adler, now a popular music-hall singer, who reveals that Moriarty has kidnapped her son. Moriarty has also left a note for Holmes informing him that he will be approached by the police soon for aid in a crime, and should he not refuse- Moriarty also informing him that he should provide no reason for his refusal- the boy will die. Holmes is subsequently contacted by the NYPD regarding the recent apparent theft at the New York bank, with the entire vault of gold bars having vanished seemingly overnight. To protect the child, Holmes refuses the case, but he and Watson later manage to track down and rescue the boy, thus removing Moriarty's blackmail card. Investigating the vaults, and quickly ruling as impossible the actual removal of many tonnes of gold via a narrow tunnel in the time available, Holmes swiftly determines what has taken place; based on the speed of the lift's descent, it should take them 45 seconds to reach the vaults, but they stopped after only 42 seconds. From this, Holmes deduces that Moriarty had an empty, duplicate vault built a few metres above the real one, subsequently planting wooden boards to stop the lift reaching the real vault.

3473059At a government laboratory, a weaponized version of influenza is accidentally released, immediately wiping out everyone at the laboratory, save for security guard Charles Campion and his family, who flee the base. However, Campion unknowingly spreads the ""super flu"" to the outside world. One of the first sites of infection is at a gas station in East Texas where Stu Redman  and some friends have gathered. While others take sick, Stu remains mysteriously healthy and is kept in confinement at a CDC facility in order to study a possible cure. This proves futile and the superflu rages unchecked, killing over 99% of the population. After the infection runs its course a small group of immune survivors lies scattered across the country. These include rock star Larry Underwood , who has just had his big break but is now stranded in a dead New York City, Nick Andros  a deaf man in the midwest, Frannie Goldsmith  a teenager in Ogunquit, Maine, Lloyd Henreid  a criminal stuck in a prison cell, and ""Trashcan Man""  a mentally ill scavenger. The survivors soon begin having visions, either of Mother Abagail  a kindly old black woman, or of a demonic seeming man named Randall Flagg, . The two sets of visions call their recipients to travel either to Nebraska to meet Mother Abagail, or to Las Vegas to join Randall Flagg. As their journeys begin, Lloyd Henreid is freed from prison by Randall Flagg in exchange for becoming Flagg's second in command. Trashcan Man, who is a pyromaniac, destroys a set of fuel tanks outside of Des Moines, Iowa hoping to find acceptance with Randall Flagg. Larry Underwood escapes New York and meets a mysterious woman Nadine Cross . Despite their mutual attraction, Nadine is unable to consummate a relationship with Larry, because of her visions of Randall Flagg, who commands her to join him as his concubine. Eventually she leaves Larry to travel on her own. Stu escapes from the CDC facility and soon gathers a group around him including retired professor Glen Bateman , Frannie Goldsmith, and Harold Lauder  a hometown acquaintance of Frannie's who also survived the superflu. Harold grows increasingly frustrated at the way that Stu assumes a leadership role and at Stu's growing romance with Frannie, on whom Harold has a crush. Meanwhile, Nick Andros, makes his way across the midwest, eventually joined by Tom Cullen  a gentle mentally challenged man. Eventually, Stu's group reaches Mother Abagail's farm in Hemingford Home, Nebraska. She tells them of a great conflict that will soon be coming and that they must all travel on to Boulder, Colorado. There, the various survivors, including Nick Andros, Tom Cullen, and Larry Underwood, join with others to form a new community based around Mother Abagail's teachings. Meanwhile, Randall Flagg has set up his own society in Las Vegas, dedicated to violence and excess. For a while, everything seems good in Boulder as people settle down to a new life. However, Frannie discovers that she is pregnant with Jess Rider's child , something which causes her anxiety because she is not sure whether her child will be immune to the superflu. Meanwhile, Harold Lauder grows increasingly dissatisfied with his life in Boulder and begins experiencing visions from Randall Flagg. He is soon seduced by Nadine Cross, and decides to follow Flagg's dictates. Mother Abagail, now the spiritual center of the community, becomes convinced that she has fallen into the sin of pride, and leaves town to walk in the wilderness. Harold builds a bomb and hides it inside the building where Boulder's newly formed leadership council is meeting. Nick Andros notices the bomb and attempts to get it away from everyone else, dying in the process. Most survive, to learn that Mother Abagail has returned from exile and lies dying. Before she passes away she tells Stu, Larry, Glen, and fellow council member Ralph Brentner that they must travel to Las Vegas to confront Flagg. With Winter fast approaching the four men set out on their quest. While crossing a washed out road, Stu breaks his leg and stays behind while the others continue. Larry, Glen, and Ralph are soon captured by Flagg's forces and forced to endure a show trial before being executed. As they are being tortured, to the delight of Flagg's acolytes, Trashcan Man arrives, with a nuclear bomb on a cart. As Flagg transforms into a demonic visage, a spectral hand reaches out and detonates the bomb, destroying Las Vegas and apparently killing Flagg. Stu is rescued by Tom Cullen, who takes him to a nearby cabin to heal as winter sets in. Back in Boulder no one is sure what happened to their missing friends, until Tom and Stu show up in the midst of a blinding snow storm. Soon after being reunited with Stu, Frannie gives birth to a healthy baby; a daughter named in honor of Mother Abagail.
4503438The story begins with the end of winter, and the southern ocean showing the aurora australis. A flock of penguins, coming from the north, returns home. The females separate from their mates to go hunt as males build their nests from piles of pebbles. The females return to lay their eggs, only to eventually separate from the males again, whilst the males take care of the eggs. A flock of aggressive seagulls constantly threatens to steal the penguin eggs and raids the nesting grounds while the females are away. A father  of a couple saves the egg of another family, meanwhile one of their two eggs is stolen from their nest. When the mother  returns, the father says that one of the eggs is not theirs. They return one of the eggs and have one egg for themselves. When the eggs finally hatch, the egg that is kept hatches into a blue and white male penguin named Scamper . He meets a pink and white female penguin, and attends ""school"". The students are educated by a wise, old grandfather-figure penguin that is black and white. They have a physical fitness coach who is also blue and white. The teacher and the coach bear a resemblance to Scamper's  parents. The teacher educates them about an elephant seal. While the seal yawns, the teacher observes and describes its mouth. Once the seal finishes yawning, it chomps on the teacher's head, but he is released unharmed. The physical fitness coach teaches the young penguins how to slide. Much later, she will teach them how to swim. She must stay alert because the penguins cannot swim yet, as the water is too cold. Scamper , like any other young penguin, is over-inquisitive and very curious. His adventurous personality is encouraged by the teacher, whom Scamper  takes his advice literally. Furthermore, he wanders off often, and gets in trouble with his father. In one of his adventures, he meets a dog, a husky named Cowboy  and his human guardian, who are on a scientific expedition. Momentarily he decides to with his best friend Snowflake , escape again. Scamper  introduces Snowflake  to Cowboy , but Scamper  is attacked again by an seagull, which Cowboy  grabbed and assaulted. The scientist heals Scamper 's wounds. Later, the two penguins crash towards the water . They are stranded on the ice because they still cannot swim. Once they mature, they would grow more feathers to insulate from the water, but they are still too young. They are unable to call for help, and they cannot find any food to eat. They find a group of xenophobic Emperor Penguins, which ignore their cries for help. They are attacked by a leopard seal, who is attacked itself by an orca. The orca ignores the penguins, who are now on a much smaller block of ice. The two penguins are rescued by the crew of a ship. The penguins think that the crew is of gentle scientists, but are mistaken. The men are poachers and they throw the penguins into a cage. They have a neighbor, who is a male, black feathered, macaroni penguin. They also attempt to befriend another dog, a Saint Bernard. Once they escape, they eat a disc-shaped food. They are chased by the poachers. The Saint Bernard howls, and the crew of the ship take cover because they think there is a storm approaching. The Saint Bernard gives them a life saver which they float onto another block of ice. They have grown now, and can swim and eat. Once the penguins return home. The coach alerts the rest of the community that the teacher has been shot and the students have been captured in a net. The coach stays to care for the teacher, while Scamper's  father leads a rescue. The poachers end up caught in a tidal wave which was caused by their gunshots echoing. The story ends as the dark winter comes, and the penguins go northward again, now led by Scamper. The macaroni penguin later decides to find his own community.

Twenty years later, Victor Plaza  shows up for a date he made with Elena , a junkie with whom he had sex a week earlier. Waiting for her dealer to arrive, Elena is not interested in seeing Victor and tells him to leave. Finally she gets a gun and orders him out of the flat. Enraged, Victor wrestles the gun from her; in the process Elena gets knocked out, and the gun goes off. A neighbor hears the shot and calls the police; and two cops respond to the report. The older cop, Sancho , is an unstable alcoholic who suspects his wife Clara  of infidelity. The younger cop, David , more clean-cut and sober, prefers to do things by the book. Through the window they catch sight of Victor physically struggling with Elena, and Sancho is ready to storm in, while David wants to call for a back-up. When they enter, Victor holds Elena hostage with her gun. David tries to calm him down and get him to drop his gun, but Sancho sabotages his efforts by continually threatening Victor. Finally, David puts his gun to Sancho's head, gets him and Victor to put down their guns and orders Elena to flee. Sancho then lunges for Victor, they wrestle for the gun, and another shot rings out, hitting David. Two years later, Victor, in jail, watches a wheelchair basketball match: the now partially paralyzed David is a star player in the 1992 Summer Paralympics, with Elena, who is now his wife, cheering him on from the sidelines. Victor has made good use of his time, taking a correspondence course in education, working out, and enriching his mind with a variety of subjects, including the Bible. Before he is released, another four years later, his mother dies and leaves him some money and a house in the slums. One of his first stops after he gets out of jail is his mother's grave, where he encounters Elena at her father's funeral. While leaving the cemetery he meets Clara, Sancho's wife. Elena, now off drugs and operating an orphanage, tells David of her encounter with Victor. David stops by Victor's house and warns him not to go near his wife. Victor queries how he can do this, but David grabs his genitals and he doubles up. When David gets into his car to leave, he sees Clara arriving, and stay on to watch from a distance. Attracted by Victor's enthusiasm and good looks, Clara agrees to teach him how to make love, as well as pampering him with gifts and affection. She eventually falls in love with him. Victor begins to volunteer at the orphanage, which is happy to have him because he fixed the boiler, has a degree in education and is very good with the children. Elena objects, but can't find a compelling reason to throw Victor out. David continues to trail Victor and finds out that Victor works at Elena's orphanage. He confronts him again; Victor tells him that it was Sancho who made Victor squeeze the trigger. Afterwards, David tells his wife what Victor said, and the revealing context that Sancho shot David because he was having an affair with Clara. Elena is disgusted, but still plans to leave the orphanage to get away from Victor. Victor tells Elena that his original plan of revenge was to become the world's greatest lover, make love to Elena all night long, and then leave her hanging, but that he still loves her too much to do so. Victor tells Clara that they should stop meeting, and they break up. While Victor is on night-shift at the orphanage, Elena comes in to remove her belongings, and agrees to a night of passion with Victor, on condition that he never contacts her again. Elena tells David herself about her infidelity, and although she plans to stay with him, he plots his own revenge. Clara leaves Sancho, who was abusing her, shooting him in the process. David shows up at Sancho's place with photographic proof of Victor and Clara's affair. Sancho and David drive to Victor's house, where Sancho shoots and kills Clara, while Clara also wounds Sancho, and Sancho finally kills himself. At the end, David narrates a letter written to his wife from Miami, where he is spending Christmas with some friends, apologizing for the way everything turned out. While at the orphanage, a pregnant Elena goes into labor and on the way to the hospital, she and Victor get stuck in heavy traffic. Victor is reminded of the circumstances of his own birth, and tells his unborn child that the fears of the Spanish have passed.

Siu Lin is searching for her lost husband, during which she supports herself by playing on a sanxian that said husband gave to her as a gift. She finds him inside the pub as the new husband of the governor's niece. The niece starts a battle with Sui Lin where they both seem equal, but the husband hits Siu Lin on her head with a stool causing her to collapse.

Due to his arrogance, Tienbo declines and starts to fight Junbao thinking that he is still the inferior fighter. To Tienbo's surprise, however, Junbao is now fighting using the heretofore unseen style of Tai Chi Chuan. Because the style relies less on size, power, speed and strength, Junbao is able to fend off Tienbo with ease. Seeking an additional advantage in their fight, Tienbo kills the governor in order to gain complete control over the troops surrounding them. Siu Lin intervenes and convinces them not to listen to Tienbo as he just betrayed their leader. Seeing this , the troops back off and leave Tienbo's fate to Junbao.

28147804The film starts with a short introduction to the history of Portuguese exploration in the Age of Discovery to India, referring the legendary landing of explorer Vasco da Gama on 20 May 1498 in Calicut, the kingdom ruled by Zamorins of Calicut. The typical Primary School teachers narration  is initially accompanied with Google Image Search on ""Vasco da Gama"", followed by stills from his journey and moving images at the end. The meeting of Vasco da Gama  with Zamorin with traditional hospitality, and the failed interview to produce any concrete results is also depicted. Then the celebrations of the greatest discovery till in Lisbon is shown . In a party, da Gama is seen talking to his young son, Estêvão, who will later turn crucial character in the film. The scene changes to a club in present day Goa, where we see two young men, Krishna Das  and his friend, dancing. These two young men are running a music troupe and are completely unaware of the history or heritage of their land. From the agents of a multinational mining cooperation, Krishna Das knows that his ancestral property in Kerala leased out to a N. G. O. by his late mother is rich in minerals and is free to be sold as the lease period has lapsed. The company offers him a large of money as advance. Krishna Das is told that there some problems exist, that he has to convince the people running the N. G. O. for this transaction. When he reaches the plot, he is kidnapped by some tribal  men to cave deep in the forest, and where he meets their chief Thangachan . Thangachan explains to him that he is the descendant of Chirakkal Kelu Nayanar, and Thangachan resumes the narration. The narration continues with Portuguese activities in India, and effects of Colonization on the Malabar Coast. In 1502, Gama commanded the 4th Portuguese Armada to India, a fleet of fifteen ships and eight hundred men, with the object of enforcing Portuguese interests in the east. On reaching India in October 1502, Gama started capturing any Arab vessel he came across in Indian waters. On his way to Cannanore when he had reached the northern parts of the Indian Ocean, Gama waited for a ship to return from Mecca and seized all the merchandise on it. The Portuguese chases the pilgrim ship down, which surrenders rather quickly, probably imagining that its master and they had enough money to ransom it off. But Vasco da Gama shrugs off all the offers. The general of the king of Kolathunad, Chirakkal Kothuwal , sends a Brahmin negotiator and his own son, Kelu, to the Portuguese ship ""São Gabriel"" for negotiations on a Mecca Ship, ""Miri"". But, da Gama rejects all peace talks and barbarously cut off the Brahmin's ears and sews ears of his dog on the same spot. He then ordered the hundreds of passengers be locked in the hold and Mîrî, and which contained many wealthy Muslim merchants – to be set on fire. It took several days to finally go down completely, and general of the king of Kolathunad, Chirakkal Kothuwal storms ""São Gabriel"" to rescue his son, Kelu. But, on this charismatic attempt Chirakkal Kothuwal loses his life to the Portuguese, and only Kelu escapes devastated by his fathers loss. Vavvali, a Tamil Muslim boy, takes Kelu with him to his dwelling, and treats him as his own younger brother. Kelu forms an Urumi, specially made with the left over ornaments of the dead women and children of ""Miri"". He takes an oath that he will kill da Gama. Then it shows a foreshadowing of Kelu  and Vavvali  as adults hunting rabbits in a forest somewhere in Kolathunad. Where they are confronted by some strangers trying to abduct Bala , the princess of Kolathunad. Kelu and Vavvali save the princess, but they are subsequently captured by the soldiers of Kolathiri, accompanied by the heir apparent, Bhanu Vikraman  of Chirakkal. They are charged with attempted kidnap of the Princess and keeping foreign weapons such as pistol. Originally the pistol belonged to the real abductors, but the king's judgement was the execution by elephant. On the way, Princess Bala comes and reveals that these men are in fact saviours, not attempted abductors. Soon thereeafter they are told by the King to capture de Gama, however they instead capture de Gama's son. In the process, they come across Princess Ayesha of Arackel, a fiery warrior princess who fights any justice in her kingdom. However, as Vavvali and Kelu make their way through the kingdom having captured de Gama's son, they witness several men from the kingdom of Chirakkal gathering up the women who have been affected by the battle . Back in Chirakkal, the king bestow's Kelu with the honour of being the new general. Vavvali however is slightly unhappy as the king neglected to acknowledge his role in the capture of de Gama's son. Later, the women of Arackel are brought before the king. He immediately begins to ogle at them, especially Ayesha. She however, insists that she would be better suited for Bhanu than the king, to which the king agrees. Ayesha prepares for a night with Bhanu, however Bhanu  had initially had his eye on a young girl among the group. When he mentions that he wished that she too could join him, Ayesha strangles him. This had been her plan from the start, a plan foiled when palace guards arrive and take her away after Kelu restrains her. The king orders that she be 'spoiled' so that no one will dare to look at her ever again. As she is being taken away in a cage by guards, Kelu arrives and frees her. He tells her to leave and never return. Ayesha soon returns however to help the other women of Arackel still facing sexual and physical abuse at the hands of the king, Prince Bhanu and other men of the palace. At the same time, Kelu decides to help the women escape, as well as take de Gama's son from the king's custody – he feels that the king may not be the right person to seek in fighting against de Gama. Vavvali was supposed to bring de Gama, but in a mix-up de Gama is recaptured and Vavvali seen as the hero who caught him – he is given the honour of being co-general to the king with Kelu. Meanwhile, Kelu takes the women to safety in a nearby village; they are given medical attention. He then gives his urumi to Ayesha telling her to safeguard the women while he returns to Chirakkal to see what happened to Vavvali and de Gama's son. In Chirakkal he realises what has happened, and tells Vavvali that they must start their revolution against de Gama. They set out to all the nearby villages, with Ayesha joining their effort, destroying all hanging structures built by the Portuguese. As their support grew among all the peasants, members of the palace start to poison the king and the Prince Bhanu that Kelu and Vavvali are going to overthrow them. Meanwhile, de Gama is planning an attack to save his son. He sends in troops to Chirakkal, where they meet with Kelu, Vavvali, and Ayesha. A battle ensues, but they fall to the strength of Kelu and his fellow warriors. As the warriors take rest after the battle, Kelu and Ayesha finally admit their feelings to one another and embrace. Meanwhile, de Gama receives a box from India containing the severed fingers of his son, angering him again. Back in India, Bhanu seeks assistance from de Gama's son to obtain guns. He then meets with de Gama, and almost gets killed. In return for sparing his life, Bhanu helps de Gama's son escape. Bhanu also retrieves a deed giving  to . But when his father cannot accept his actions, Bhanu kills the king with the gun received from de Gama's son. News of the king's death reaches Kelu and his warriors. Kelu returns to discuss with Bhanu  what actions to take against de Gama, but Bhanu hesitantly states that the kingdom's army will not longer take orders from him. Kelu then confronts the member of the palace  who has poisoned the king's son's intentions. Meanwhile, de Gama's son returns to de Gama's fort. The princess of Chirakkal also asks Vavvali to take her with him, as she feels ashamed that her own brother killed their father. Vavvali agrees and takes her away with the help of some of the palace guards. Meanwhile, de Gama and his son return to Chirakkal to meet with Bhanu. Thinking it a friendly visit, Bhanu welcomes them only to be killed. Soon thereafter, de Gama comes with his troops in search of Kelu and his warriors. Initially it seems that de Gama's troops are retreating after losing heavily in the battle, but then de Gama's son shoots Vavvali.

The program is one wherein minor celebrity guests are employed to investigate haunted houses and similarly mysterious locales, in an attempt to determine the truth about such places, and their associated paranormal phenomena. The members of Momoiro Clover are asked to visit an abandoned school, where a shrine to the minor deity  known as ""Shirome"" is located. This shrine takes the form of a painting that is thought to be of a butterfly, but which may actually represent the being's face. According to local legends, if Shirome is asked to grant a wish, he will do so, but only if the person asking is completely sincere in both their request, and their belief in the existence and power of the Shirome entity. If any wish is asked of this being in a frivolous manner, or in a spirit of unbelief, Shirome will destroy that person, either through causing them to have a fatal accident, inducing them to commit suicide, or driving them hopelessly insane.

13439264The film begins in medias res, with the suspects getting caught and being interrogated. Then it flashes back to three years earlier and the film continues forward from there, interspersed with occasional bits from the interrogation. Three years before getting caught, Bridget Cardigan  lived a comfortable upper middle class life until her husband Don Cardigan  was ""downsized"" from his position and sunk into debt. The paycheck for Selina, the housecleaner, bounces again. Selina confronts Bridget and suggests she take a job as a janitor at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. On her first day on the job, Bridget hatches a scheme to steal worn-out dollar bills slated for destruction. For her team she chooses Nina , who works the dollar bill shredder, and Jackie , who takes bill carts from the Secret Service room to the shredding room. It takes some work to persuade Nina to join, but Jackie joins them quickly. The plan is that in the Secret Service room Bridget will switch a cart's official Master-brand lock with a near identical lock she purchased at Home Depot. Bridget will tell Jackie the cart number and give Nina the official lock. When Jackie gets the chosen cart, she dumps some bills from the cart into a trash can before taking the cart to Nina, who then uses Bridget's key to open it and restores the official lock, and then proceeds to shred the remaining bills. Meanwhile, Bridget, in the course of her janitorial duties, retrieves the dumped bills from the trash and splits them among Nina and Jackie in the women's restroom. Their first robbery is a success though the take is not as big as they had hoped. However, they're emboldened to do it repeatedly. Once Don and Bridget pay off their debt, Don suggests they stop before they get caught. Bridget rejects this idea and persuades Nina and Jackie to keep going. They almost get caught but they end up cutting in Barry, one of the security guards, who is attracted to Nina. A Federal Bank Examiner shows up at a party at Bridget's house, and the next day Bridget sees him at work. The Examiner confronts Glover , who is unwilling to admit anyone has stolen a single bill out of his bank as a matter of professional pride. Tipped off, that night Bridget and her accomplices begin trying to get rid of all the loot stashed in their houses, but the cops move in before all the evidence is destroyed. Bridget escapes but the others get caught. Bridget hires a tax attorney to defend them. The lawyer gets Bridget and all her accomplices off the hook for their crimes, because neither the law enforcement, nor the examiner can prove that the large stash of cash in their homes came from the Federal Reserve Bank. Technically, it isn't illegal to have a couple hundred thousand dollars in cash lying around inside a private residence. However, they spent a large sum of that stolen cash to buy expensive objects and improvements on their houses, and did not pay the taxes for them because they couldn't justify the income. The IRS demands they pay their taxes, which turn out to be equal in amount to the money that still remains. Eight months later, Bridget reveals to Nina and Jackie that she had stashed away much of the stolen money in the basement of a friend's bar.

2266239Leon , a genius, summons five college students to his apartment and challenges them to participate in his latest game creation: The Great All-Nighter. He tells them about his game and instructs them to form teams. At first, the leaders refuse to play. However, rivalries between them lead all five to change their minds by the game's start time. The game works like this: # Teams are given an initial clue to solve. # When the clue is solved, it will lead to a location. # At that location they must find and solve another clue leading to another location and eventually the end. Leon, as ""game master,"" keeps track of the teams locations with a giant map, and various radio equipment. The teams are supposed to call and check in at each clue . Starting at sundown, the five teams meet and are given envelopes with the first clue. They travel around Los Angeles, deciphering new clues in various locations, including the Griffith Observatory, a piano museum, the Pabst Blue Ribbon brewery, a restaurant, a mini golf course, the Los Angeles International Airport, and a video arcade. The first team to reach the final destination, a room in the Westin Bonaventure Hotel, wins the game. The movie focuses mainly on the struggle between the yellow and blue teams. The adventures of the other three teams are subplots, as well as the situation at Leon's apartment . Here, along with his female assistants , Leon monitors the progress of the game. Already unpopular with his landlady, Mrs. Grimhaus, for the amount of noise he makes, Leon faces eviction if any of the other tenants complain. Several of them do show up to complain, but as Leon explains the mechanics of the game to them, they become fascinated with it and help run it, much to the annoyance of Grimhaus. The game culminates in a race-to-the-finish at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel, followed by a huge party.  Teams are made up of characters who are broad stereotypes. They wear matching sweatshirts, and ride in vehicles that also match their team color. *The members of the Yellow Team are all friendly, and kind; they play fair and are the main heroes of the film. The yellow team are led by the protagonist Adam . The Yellow team picks up an additional member, Adam's troubled younger brother Scott , partway through the game, who acts out to get Adam's attention. They also force the shy Flynch , whom Adam has been counseling, to play the game rather than allow him to go on a date with an ugly girl. Also on the team are Laura , Adam's love interest, and Marvin , another friend of Adam's. The team vehicle, owned by Marvin, is often referred to as a Jeep but it is actually a Toyota Land Cruiser. *The members of the Blue Team are all selfish, rude, and unattractive individuals who cheat at every opportunity. They are led by overweight snob Harold , who is intensely jealous of the popular Adam. Melio  purposely instigates fights between Harold and his girlfriend, Lucille, who puts Harold on a diet just before the game starts. ""Blade,"" a Mexican-American who is constantly brandishing his switchblade knife, never speaks. An additional member, Barf , is apparently mentally challenged. The team vehicle is a Chevy van equipped with a computer that can solve clues; however, this device is destroyed early on when Harold hides a stash of marshmallows in the circuitry. *The Green Team, also known as the ""Meat Machine,"" is made up of jocks from the school's football team. They are led by Lavitas ; Dirk Blocker is also on the team. Their antagonism leads both the Red and White teams into playing. The team vehicle is a Volkswagen Beetle named the ""Meat Wagon."" *The White Team is made up of debate team nerds, led by Wesley . The White Team rides matching Puch mopeds which they eventually share with the Red team after their vehicle is destroyed. *The Red Team is made up of four members of an unpopular sorority led by Donna, played by Maggie Roswell. Two of the members are a set of frequently giggling, overweight twins  and the other two are feminists. The Red team's vehicle is a Datsun pickup truck, which is eventually destroyed by the Green team.
1535983The 1919 Chicago White Sox are considered the greatest team in baseball and, in fact, one of the greatest ever assembled to that point. However, the team's owner, Charles Comiskey, is a skinflint with little inclination to reward his players for a spectacular season. When a gamblers gets wind of the players' discontent, it offers a select group of Sox &mdash; including star pitcher Eddie Cicotte &mdash; more money to play badly than they would have earned by winning the World Series against the Cincinnati Reds. A number of players, including Chick Gandil, Swede Risberg, and Lefty Williams, go along with the scheme. The team's greatest star, Shoeless Joe Jackson, is depicted as being not very bright and not entirely sure what is going on. Buck Weaver, meanwhile, is included with the seven others but insists that he wants nothing to do with the fix. When the best-of-nine series begins, Cicotte deliberately pitches poorly to lose the first game. Williams does likewise in Game 2, while Gandil and Hap Felsch make glaring mistakes on the field. Several of the players become upset, however, when the various gamblers involved fail to pay their promised money up front. Chicago journalists Ring Lardner and Hugh Fullerton grow increasingly suspicious. Meanwhile, the team's manager, Kid Gleason, continues to hear rumors of a fix, but he remains confident that his boys will come through in the end. A third pitcher not in on the scam, Dickey Kerr, wins Game 3 for the Sox, making both gamblers and teammates uncomfortable. Other teammates such as Ray Schalk continue to play hard, while Weaver and Jackson show no visible signs of taking a dive. Cicotte, who won 29 games during the season, loses again in Game 4. With the championship now in jeopardy, Gleason intends to bench him from his next start, but Cicotte begs for another chance. The manager reluctantly agrees and is rewarded with a victory in Game 7. Unpaid by the gamblers, Williams also intends to do his best, but when his wife's life is threatened, he purposely pitches badly to lose the final game. Cincinnati wins the World Series  to the shock of Sox fans. Even worse, sportswriter Fullerton exposes the strong possibility that this series was not on the level. His findings cause Comiskey and the other owners to appoint a new commissioner of baseball, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, and give him complete authority over the sport. Eight players are indicted and brought to trial. Cicotte, Williams, and Jackson even sign confessions. But in court, while Weaver maintains his innocence, the confessions are mysteriously found to be stolen, and the popular Chicago players are found not guilty. While they celebrate, however, Judge Landis bans all eight from professional baseball for life, citing their failure to reveal being approached by gambling interests in the first place. Weaver is among those exiled from the game. The final scene shows him in the bleachers of a New Jersey minor league ballpark, watching Jackson play under an assumed name.

There, NSA Agent Augustus Gibbons fends off the attackers before barely escaping himself. Lieutenant Alabama ""Bama"" Cobb is later revealed to be responsible for the attack on the bunker. After escaping the attack, Gibbons tells his assistant, Agent Toby Shavers, that the new XXX must be more off the grid than Xander Cage was, in other words, more attitude. So he meets up with Lieutenant Darius Stone who was jailed for 20 years whilst serving in the navy for disobeying orders and breaking General George Deckert's jaw. Later, Gibbons poses as Stone's lawyer and makes a deal with him in prison. Stone, who had been in prison at Leavenworth for assaulting Deckert, makes a daring escape. Stone is later told to recover a hard drive from the NSA bunker, while trying to escape Agent Kyle Steele at the same time, and is rescued by Shavers. Some time later, Gibbons appears to be attacked in his home and murdered, with Deckert covering up the plot. Afterwards, Stone meets up with Gibbons' contact, a beautiful blonde named Charlie Mayweather, to get information and go to her safe house, but is framed so that it will appear that he murdered 3-Star General Jack Pettibone, whom Cobb and Charlie actually killed. The police arrive, and Steele enters the house and makes a deal with Stone, while Shavers later hacks into the NSA to retrieve Deckert's plans. Afterwards, Stone infiltrates Deckert's troops aboard the USS Independence and discovers Gibbons is not dead, but being held prisoner by Deckert. Apparently Deckert is setting them up. Stone is discovered by Charlie . Gibbons orders him to escape and leave him. After retrieving the blueprints of Deckert's plot, Stone gets into an M-2 Bradley Armored Fighting vehicle and fights his way out of the ship, destroying a tank commandeered by Cobb's men to kill him. He briefly converses with the lieutenant and realizes that Deckert is planning a coup. Stone makes contact with Steele and shows him the plans; stating his view that Deckert is plotting to attack the Capitol. Steele counters Stone by insisting that Deckert is guarding the Capitol, not invading it. Stone insists this is a cover, then leaves in frustration with Steele's disbelief. During a conversation with Deckert, Steele realizes Stone was right, because Deckert lets it slip that he knows that Gibbons is still alive. He finds Stone and tells him Deckert wants to kill the president and his successors so that he can take his place. Steele suggests they go off the grid. Stone, Steele, and Shavers enlist the aid of his former gang leader, Zeke, and his crew to fight Deckert's force. Together they rob an 18 wheeler, secretly hauling guns and equipment under the guise of a cheese truck. On the night of Deckert's plan, they make their move, driving though the backs of buildings and warehouses. They end up carjacking a tank , and Stone helps Steele infiltrate the Capitol building. After some gunfights , Deckert, with Cobb, abducts the President while he is making the State of the Union Address. They escape on a bullet train. Stone pursues the bullet train by car and makes it aboard; destroying the car in the process. He engages Cobb in hand-to-hand combat and finally kills him by causing an explosion. Stone fights Deckert while helping the president escape in an adjacent helicopter. Stone leaps from the fleeing train while Gibbons destroys it with a missile, obliterating Deckert. The flaming wreckage from the train lights Stone in a silhouette as he dives into the river below, narrowly avoiding the wreckage that plunges in after him. The President awards Agent Steele and the Unknown Soldier  the Medal of Honor, as Stone goes back to his thug-esque lifestyle. Deckert receives full honors at his funeral, somewhat to Stone's disgust. He and Lola part with her, leaving him the Mustang, and he drives off; the xXx tattoo can be seen on the back of his neck. In the now rebuilt NSA Headquarters, Gibbons, Steele and Shavers discuss what kind of person the next xXx agent should be; farther off the grid, a fresh face, a new model. Gibbons says that he has the perfect candidate.

16266637The great detective Sherlock Holmes and his trusted companion Dr. John Watson travel to New York City to investigate a recent threat made by Professor Moriarty. During their investigation, Holmes and Watson are reunited with their old acquaintance Irene Adler, now a popular music-hall singer, who reveals that Moriarty has kidnapped her son. Moriarty has also left a note for Holmes informing him that he will be approached by the police soon for aid in a crime, and should he not refuse- Moriarty also informing him that he should provide no reason for his refusal- the boy will die. Holmes is subsequently contacted by the NYPD regarding the recent apparent theft at the New York bank, with the entire vault of gold bars having vanished seemingly overnight. To protect the child, Holmes refuses the case, but he and Watson later manage to track down and rescue the boy, thus removing Moriarty's blackmail card. Investigating the vaults, and quickly ruling as impossible the actual removal of many tonnes of gold via a narrow tunnel in the time available, Holmes swiftly determines what has taken place; based on the speed of the lift's descent, it should take them 45 seconds to reach the vaults, but they stopped after only 42 seconds. From this, Holmes deduces that Moriarty had an empty, duplicate vault built a few metres above the real one, subsequently planting wooden boards to stop the lift reaching the real vault. While everyone puzzled over how the bars were stolen from the false vault, Moriarty would actually be stealing them from the real one below. The case is solved. As Holmes and Adler say their goodbyes, Adler comments that her son has a keen intellect and a certain knack for solving puzzles, implying that Holmes may be his father. The two nevertheless part ways with Adler giving Holmes a picture of her son to keep.

3473059At a government laboratory, a weaponized version of influenza is accidentally released, immediately wiping out everyone at the laboratory, save for security guard Charles Campion and his family, who flee the base. However, Campion unknowingly spreads the ""super flu"" to the outside world. One of the first sites of infection is at a gas station in East Texas where Stu Redman  and some friends have gathered. While others take sick, Stu remains mysteriously healthy and is kept in confinement at a CDC facility in order to study a possible cure. This proves futile and the superflu rages unchecked, killing over 99% of the population. After the infection runs its course a small group of immune survivors lies scattered across the country. These include rock star Larry Underwood , who has just had his big break but is now stranded in a dead New York City, Nick Andros  a deaf man in the midwest, Frannie Goldsmith  a teenager in Ogunquit, Maine, Lloyd Henreid  a criminal stuck in a prison cell, and ""Trashcan Man""  a mentally ill scavenger. The survivors soon begin having visions, either of Mother Abagail  a kindly old black woman, or of a demonic seeming man named Randall Flagg, . The two sets of visions call their recipients to travel either to Nebraska to meet Mother Abagail, or to Las Vegas to join Randall Flagg. As their journeys begin, Lloyd Henreid is freed from prison by Randall Flagg in exchange for becoming Flagg's second in command. Trashcan Man, who is a pyromaniac, destroys a set of fuel tanks outside of Des Moines, Iowa hoping to find acceptance with Randall Flagg. Larry Underwood escapes New York and meets a mysterious woman Nadine Cross . Despite their mutual attraction, Nadine is unable to consummate a relationship with Larry, because of her visions of Randall Flagg, who commands her to join him as his concubine. Eventually she leaves Larry to travel on her own. Stu escapes from the CDC facility and soon gathers a group around him including retired professor Glen Bateman , Frannie Goldsmith, and Harold Lauder  a hometown acquaintance of Frannie's who also survived the superflu. Harold grows increasingly frustrated at the way that Stu assumes a leadership role and at Stu's growing romance with Frannie, on whom Harold has a crush. Meanwhile, Nick Andros, makes his way across the midwest, eventually joined by Tom Cullen  a gentle mentally challenged man. Eventually, Stu's group reaches Mother Abagail's farm in Hemingford Home, Nebraska. She tells them of a great conflict that will soon be coming and that they must all travel on to Boulder, Colorado. There, the various survivors, including Nick Andros, Tom Cullen, and Larry Underwood, join with others to form a new community based around Mother Abagail's teachings. Meanwhile, Randall Flagg has set up his own society in Las Vegas, dedicated to violence and excess. For a while, everything seems good in Boulder as people settle down to a new life. However, Frannie discovers that she is pregnant with Jess Rider's child , something which causes her anxiety because she is not sure whether her child will be immune to the superflu. Meanwhile, Harold Lauder grows increasingly dissatisfied with his life in Boulder and begins experiencing visions from Randall Flagg. He is soon seduced by Nadine Cross, and decides to follow Flagg's dictates. Mother Abagail, now the spiritual center of the community, becomes convinced that she has fallen into the sin of pride, and leaves town to walk in the wilderness. Harold builds a bomb and hides it inside the building where Boulder's newly formed leadership council is meeting. Nick Andros notices the bomb and attempts to get it away from everyone else, dying in the process. Most survive, to learn that Mother Abagail has returned from exile and lies dying. Before she passes away she tells Stu, Larry, Glen, and fellow council member Ralph Brentner that they must travel to Las Vegas to confront Flagg. With Winter fast approaching the four men set out on their quest. While crossing a washed out road, Stu breaks his leg and stays behind while the others continue. Larry, Glen, and Ralph are soon captured by Flagg's forces and forced to endure a show trial before being executed. As they are being tortured, to the delight of Flagg's acolytes, Trashcan Man arrives, with a nuclear bomb on a cart. As Flagg transforms into a demonic visage, a spectral hand reaches out and detonates the bomb, destroying Las Vegas and apparently killing Flagg. Stu is rescued by Tom Cullen, who takes him to a nearby cabin to heal as winter sets in. Back in Boulder no one is sure what happened to their missing friends, until Tom and Stu show up in the midst of a blinding snow storm. Soon after being reunited with Stu, Frannie gives birth to a healthy baby; a daughter named in honor of Mother Abagail.
4503438The story begins with the end of winter, and the southern ocean showing the aurora australis. A flock of penguins, coming from the north, returns home. The females separate from their mates to go hunt as males build their nests from piles of pebbles. The females return to lay their eggs, only to eventually separate from the males again, whilst the males take care of the eggs. A flock of aggressive seagulls constantly threatens to steal the penguin eggs and raids the nesting grounds while the females are away. A father  of a couple saves the egg of another family, meanwhile one of their two eggs is stolen from their nest. When the mother  returns, the father says that one of the eggs is not theirs. They return one of the eggs and have one egg for themselves. When the eggs finally hatch, the egg that is kept hatches into a blue and white male penguin named Scamper . He meets a pink and white female penguin, and attends ""school"". The students are educated by a wise, old grandfather-figure penguin that is black and white. They have a physical fitness coach who is also blue and white. The teacher and the coach bear a resemblance to Scamper's  parents. The teacher educates them about an elephant seal. While the seal yawns, the teacher observes and describes its mouth. Once the seal finishes yawning, it chomps on the teacher's head, but he is released unharmed. The physical fitness coach teaches the young penguins how to slide. Much later, she will teach them how to swim. She must stay alert because the penguins cannot swim yet, as the water is too cold. Scamper , like any other young penguin, is over-inquisitive and very curious. His adventurous personality is encouraged by the teacher, whom Scamper  takes his advice literally. Furthermore, he wanders off often, and gets in trouble with his father. In one of his adventures, he meets a dog, a husky named Cowboy  and his human guardian, who are on a scientific expedition. Momentarily he decides to with his best friend Snowflake , escape again. Scamper  introduces Snowflake  to Cowboy , but Scamper  is attacked again by an seagull, which Cowboy  grabbed and assaulted. The scientist heals Scamper 's wounds. Later, the two penguins crash towards the water . They are stranded on the ice because they still cannot swim. Once they mature, they would grow more feathers to insulate from the water, but they are still too young. They are unable to call for help, and they cannot find any food to eat. They find a group of xenophobic Emperor Penguins, which ignore their cries for help. They are attacked by a leopard seal, who is attacked itself by an orca. The orca ignores the penguins, who are now on a much smaller block of ice. The two penguins are rescued by the crew of a ship. The penguins think that the crew is of gentle scientists, but are mistaken. The men are poachers and they throw the penguins into a cage. They have a neighbor, who is a male, black feathered, macaroni penguin. They also attempt to befriend another dog, a Saint Bernard. Once they escape, they eat a disc-shaped food. They are chased by the poachers. The Saint Bernard howls, and the crew of the ship take cover because they think there is a storm approaching. The Saint Bernard gives them a life saver which they float onto another block of ice. They have grown now, and can swim and eat. Once the penguins return home. The coach alerts the rest of the community that the teacher has been shot and the students have been captured in a net. The coach stays to care for the teacher, while Scamper's  father leads a rescue. The poachers end up caught in a tidal wave which was caused by their gunshots echoing. The story ends as the dark winter comes, and the penguins go northward again, now led by Scamper. The macaroni penguin later decides to find his own community.

3950291Madrid, Christmas 1970: with the nation under a state of emergency ordered by the Franco regime, a young prostitute, Isabel Plaza Caballero , gives birth on a bus to a son she names Victor. Twenty years later, Victor Plaza  shows up for a date he made with Elena , a junkie with whom he had sex a week earlier. Waiting for her dealer to arrive, Elena is not interested in seeing Victor and tells him to leave. Finally she gets a gun and orders him out of the flat. Enraged, Victor wrestles the gun from her; in the process Elena gets knocked out, and the gun goes off. A neighbor hears the shot and calls the police; and two cops respond to the report. The older cop, Sancho , is an unstable alcoholic who suspects his wife Clara  of infidelity. The younger cop, David , more clean-cut and sober, prefers to do things by the book. Through the window they catch sight of Victor physically struggling with Elena, and Sancho is ready to storm in, while David wants to call for a back-up. When they enter, Victor holds Elena hostage with her gun. David tries to calm him down and get him to drop his gun, but Sancho sabotages his efforts by continually threatening Victor. Finally, David puts his gun to Sancho's head, gets him and Victor to put down their guns and orders Elena to flee. Sancho then lunges for Victor, they wrestle for the gun, and another shot rings out, hitting David. Two years later, Victor, in jail, watches a wheelchair basketball match: the now partially paralyzed David is a star player in the 1992 Summer Paralympics, with Elena, who is now his wife, cheering him on from the sidelines. Victor has made good use of his time, taking a correspondence course in education, working out, and enriching his mind with a variety of subjects, including the Bible. Before he is released, another four years later, his mother dies and leaves him some money and a house in the slums. One of his first stops after he gets out of jail is his mother's grave, where he encounters Elena at her father's funeral. While leaving the cemetery he meets Clara, Sancho's wife. Elena, now off drugs and operating an orphanage, tells David of her encounter with Victor. David stops by Victor's house and warns him not to go near his wife. Victor queries how he can do this, but David grabs his genitals and he doubles up. When David gets into his car to leave, he sees Clara arriving, and stay on to watch from a distance. Attracted by Victor's enthusiasm and good looks, Clara agrees to teach him how to make love, as well as pampering him with gifts and affection. She eventually falls in love with him. Victor begins to volunteer at the orphanage, which is happy to have him because he fixed the boiler, has a degree in education and is very good with the children. Elena objects, but can't find a compelling reason to throw Victor out. David continues to trail Victor and finds out that Victor works at Elena's orphanage. He confronts him again; Victor tells him that it was Sancho who made Victor squeeze the trigger. Afterwards, David tells his wife what Victor said, and the revealing context that Sancho shot David because he was having an affair with Clara. Elena is disgusted, but still plans to leave the orphanage to get away from Victor. Victor tells Elena that his original plan of revenge was to become the world's greatest lover, make love to Elena all night long, and then leave her hanging, but that he still loves her too much to do so. Victor tells Clara that they should stop meeting, and they break up. While Victor is on night-shift at the orphanage, Elena comes in to remove her belongings, and agrees to a night of passion with Victor, on condition that he never contacts her again. Elena tells David herself about her infidelity, and although she plans to stay with him, he plots his own revenge. Clara leaves Sancho, who was abusing her, shooting him in the process. David shows up at Sancho's place with photographic proof of Victor and Clara's affair. Sancho and David drive to Victor's house, where Sancho shoots and kills Clara, while Clara also wounds Sancho, and Sancho finally kills himself. At the end, David narrates a letter written to his wife from Miami, where he is spending Christmas with some friends, apologizing for the way everything turned out. While at the orphanage, a pregnant Elena goes into labor and on the way to the hospital, she and Victor get stuck in heavy traffic. Victor is reminded of the circumstances of his own birth, and tells his unborn child that the fears of the Spanish have passed.

They are both expelled from the temple after Tienbo almost kills a fellow student who cheats in a fight against him. Aided in their escape by their sympathetic teacher, they receive final instructions regarding the potential paths of their different personalities, with a specific warning given to Tienbo. They both then go into the outside world to find their way in life. Meanwhile, a gang of henchmen are forcibly taking money from a local shop owner. A woman named Miss Li steals the money and returns it. Having noticed the money gone, the henchmen start to fight with Miss Li. Miss Li holds her own during the fight, but soon gets into a bit of trouble due to her being outnumbered. Junbao comes to her aid and defeats the gang. Army reinforcements arrive to break up the fight and so the trio run away to escape capture. At this moment the eunuch governor travels through the town, roughing up the locals as he does so. Tienbo realizes that he wants to be as rich and powerful as the governor, but Miss Li warns him that he has ""a heart of a viper"" and wonders if he could handle this power. Miss Li then shows them to a pub to get food. Inside the pub, they find a woman named Siu Lin. Siu Lin is searching for her lost husband, during which she supports herself by playing on a sanxian that said husband gave to her as a gift. She finds him inside the pub as the new husband of the governor's niece. The niece starts a battle with Sui Lin where they both seem equal, but the husband hits Siu Lin on her head with a stool causing her to collapse. Junbao helps Siu Lin by defending her against her ex-husband and the niece's guards. The next day, while Junbao and Tienbo are making money with their amazing kung fu skills, the governor's second in command spots them and is impressed with Tienbo's abilities  He offers him to join the army  however, Junbao is more reluctant to do so and declines going with Tienbo and so the two go their separate ways. Later, some soldiers come to the pub to collect taxes  but Junbao and the rebels  fight and kills them one by one. One soldier escapes alive and starts off towards the army's camp to warn them about the rebels with Junbao in pursuit. Just in front of the army encampment, Tienbo kills the soldier before he warns the rest of the army about the rebels whereabouts.

Junbao and Siu Lin collect all the rebels from the region, and go to the army camp . A big battle occurs where most of the rebels die. Tienbo captures Miss Li and Siu Lin. In the end, the only survivors are Junbao and a few rebels. Because of the trap, the governor promotes Tienbo to lieutenant. With his new authority  Tienbo kills Miss Li, and holds Siu Lin as bait so that he can try to convert Junbao to the army's cause. This is unsuccessful and Junbao rescues her. Due to the fact that his best friend betrayed him, Junbao's mind snaps and he goes crazy for days. While recuperating in the countryside with Siu Lin, he has a sudden epiphany that leads to him regaining his mental health and inspiration for the creation of the martial art of Tai Chi Chuan. While the governor is traveling to Beijing to see the emperor with his sister, they encounter Junbao and Siu Lin who kill the soldiers guarding them and also kills the niece. With the governor captured as a hostage, they go to the army camp and demand Tienbo to surrender his wealth and his power. Due to his arrogance, Tienbo declines and starts to fight Junbao thinking that he is still the inferior fighter. To Tienbo's surprise, however, Junbao is now fighting using the heretofore unseen style of Tai Chi Chuan. Because the style relies less on size, power, speed and strength, Junbao is able to fend off Tienbo with ease. Seeking an additional advantage in their fight, Tienbo kills the governor in order to gain complete control over the troops surrounding them. Siu Lin intervenes and convinces them not to listen to Tienbo as he just betrayed their leader. Seeing this , the troops back off and leave Tienbo's fate to Junbao. After a stunning series of parries and blows by Junbao, Tienbo is defeated and ultimately killed due to his reluctance to accept fate and admit defeat. After the fight Siu Lin and Junbao go their separate ways with Junbao returning to the Shaolin temple and establishing his own school to teach Tai Chi Chuan.
28147804The film starts with a short introduction to the history of Portuguese exploration in the Age of Discovery to India, referring the legendary landing of explorer Vasco da Gama on 20 May 1498 in Calicut, the kingdom ruled by Zamorins of Calicut. The typical Primary School teachers narration  is initially accompanied with Google Image Search on ""Vasco da Gama"", followed by stills from his journey and moving images at the end. The meeting of Vasco da Gama  with Zamorin with traditional hospitality, and the failed interview to produce any concrete results is also depicted. Then the celebrations of the greatest discovery till in Lisbon is shown . In a party, da Gama is seen talking to his young son, Estêvão, who will later turn crucial character in the film. The scene changes to a club in present day Goa, where we see two young men, Krishna Das  and his friend, dancing. These two young men are running a music troupe and are completely unaware of the history or heritage of their land. From the agents of a multinational mining cooperation, Krishna Das knows that his ancestral property in Kerala leased out to a N. G. O. by his late mother is rich in minerals and is free to be sold as the lease period has lapsed. The company offers him a large of money as advance. Krishna Das is told that there some problems exist, that he has to convince the people running the N. G. O. for this transaction. When he reaches the plot, he is kidnapped by some tribal  men to cave deep in the forest, and where he meets their chief Thangachan . Thangachan explains to him that he is the descendant of Chirakkal Kelu Nayanar, and Thangachan resumes the narration. The narration continues with Portuguese activities in India, and effects of Colonization on the Malabar Coast. In 1502, Gama commanded the 4th Portuguese Armada to India, a fleet of fifteen ships and eight hundred men, with the object of enforcing Portuguese interests in the east. On reaching India in October 1502, Gama started capturing any Arab vessel he came across in Indian waters. On his way to Cannanore when he had reached the northern parts of the Indian Ocean, Gama waited for a ship to return from Mecca and seized all the merchandise on it. The Portuguese chases the pilgrim ship down, which surrenders rather quickly, probably imagining that its master and they had enough money to ransom it off. But Vasco da Gama shrugs off all the offers. The general of the king of Kolathunad, Chirakkal Kothuwal , sends a Brahmin negotiator and his own son, Kelu, to the Portuguese ship ""São Gabriel"" for negotiations on a Mecca Ship, ""Miri"". But, da Gama rejects all peace talks and barbarously cut off the Brahmin's ears and sews ears of his dog on the same spot. He then ordered the hundreds of passengers be locked in the hold and Mîrî, and which contained many wealthy Muslim merchants – to be set on fire. It took several days to finally go down completely, and general of the king of Kolathunad, Chirakkal Kothuwal storms ""São Gabriel"" to rescue his son, Kelu. But, on this charismatic attempt Chirakkal Kothuwal loses his life to the Portuguese, and only Kelu escapes devastated by his fathers loss. Vavvali, a Tamil Muslim boy, takes Kelu with him to his dwelling, and treats him as his own younger brother. Kelu forms an Urumi, specially made with the left over ornaments of the dead women and children of ""Miri"". He takes an oath that he will kill da Gama. Then it shows a foreshadowing of Kelu  and Vavvali  as adults hunting rabbits in a forest somewhere in Kolathunad. Where they are confronted by some strangers trying to abduct Bala , the princess of Kolathunad. Kelu and Vavvali save the princess, but they are subsequently captured by the soldiers of Kolathiri, accompanied by the heir apparent, Bhanu Vikraman  of Chirakkal. They are charged with attempted kidnap of the Princess and keeping foreign weapons such as pistol. Originally the pistol belonged to the real abductors, but the king's judgement was the execution by elephant. On the way, Princess Bala comes and reveals that these men are in fact saviours, not attempted abductors. Soon thereeafter they are told by the King to capture de Gama, however they instead capture de Gama's son. In the process, they come across Princess Ayesha of Arackel, a fiery warrior princess who fights any justice in her kingdom. However, as Vavvali and Kelu make their way through the kingdom having captured de Gama's son, they witness several men from the kingdom of Chirakkal gathering up the women who have been affected by the battle . Back in Chirakkal, the king bestow's Kelu with the honour of being the new general. Vavvali however is slightly unhappy as the king neglected to acknowledge his role in the capture of de Gama's son. Later, the women of Arackel are brought before the king. He immediately begins to ogle at them, especially Ayesha. She however, insists that she would be better suited for Bhanu than the king, to which the king agrees. Ayesha prepares for a night with Bhanu, however Bhanu  had initially had his eye on a young girl among the group. When he mentions that he wished that she too could join him, Ayesha strangles him. This had been her plan from the start, a plan foiled when palace guards arrive and take her away after Kelu restrains her. The king orders that she be 'spoiled' so that no one will dare to look at her ever again. As she is being taken away in a cage by guards, Kelu arrives and frees her. He tells her to leave and never return. Ayesha soon returns however to help the other women of Arackel still facing sexual and physical abuse at the hands of the king, Prince Bhanu and other men of the palace. At the same time, Kelu decides to help the women escape, as well as take de Gama's son from the king's custody – he feels that the king may not be the right person to seek in fighting against de Gama. Vavvali was supposed to bring de Gama, but in a mix-up de Gama is recaptured and Vavvali seen as the hero who caught him – he is given the honour of being co-general to the king with Kelu. Meanwhile, Kelu takes the women to safety in a nearby village; they are given medical attention. He then gives his urumi to Ayesha telling her to safeguard the women while he returns to Chirakkal to see what happened to Vavvali and de Gama's son. In Chirakkal he realises what has happened, and tells Vavvali that they must start their revolution against de Gama. They set out to all the nearby villages, with Ayesha joining their effort, destroying all hanging structures built by the Portuguese. As their support grew among all the peasants, members of the palace start to poison the king and the Prince Bhanu that Kelu and Vavvali are going to overthrow them. Meanwhile, de Gama is planning an attack to save his son. He sends in troops to Chirakkal, where they meet with Kelu, Vavvali, and Ayesha. A battle ensues, but they fall to the strength of Kelu and his fellow warriors. As the warriors take rest after the battle, Kelu and Ayesha finally admit their feelings to one another and embrace. Meanwhile, de Gama receives a box from India containing the severed fingers of his son, angering him again. Back in India, Bhanu seeks assistance from de Gama's son to obtain guns. He then meets with de Gama, and almost gets killed. In return for sparing his life, Bhanu helps de Gama's son escape. Bhanu also retrieves a deed giving  to . But when his father cannot accept his actions, Bhanu kills the king with the gun received from de Gama's son. News of the king's death reaches Kelu and his warriors. Kelu returns to discuss with Bhanu  what actions to take against de Gama, but Bhanu hesitantly states that the kingdom's army will not longer take orders from him. Kelu then confronts the member of the palace  who has poisoned the king's son's intentions. Meanwhile, de Gama's son returns to de Gama's fort. The princess of Chirakkal also asks Vavvali to take her with him, as she feels ashamed that her own brother killed their father. Vavvali agrees and takes her away with the help of some of the palace guards. Meanwhile, de Gama and his son return to Chirakkal to meet with Bhanu. Thinking it a friendly visit, Bhanu welcomes them only to be killed. Soon thereafter, de Gama comes with his troops in search of Kelu and his warriors. Initially it seems that de Gama's troops are retreating after losing heavily in the battle, but then de Gama's son shoots Vavvali. As Vavvali says his last words to Kelu  de Gama's son returns to his father to update him on their progress. de Gama instructs him to go back to battle. Kelu sets off to battle with a large army including Muslim Mappilas and Syrian Christians, coming face-to-face with de Gama's son and his army.

13439264The film begins in medias res, with the suspects getting caught and being interrogated. Then it flashes back to three years earlier and the film continues forward from there, interspersed with occasional bits from the interrogation. Three years before getting caught, Bridget Cardigan  lived a comfortable upper middle class life until her husband Don Cardigan  was ""downsized"" from his position and sunk into debt. The paycheck for Selina, the housecleaner, bounces again. Selina confronts Bridget and suggests she take a job as a janitor at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. On her first day on the job, Bridget hatches a scheme to steal worn-out dollar bills slated for destruction. For her team she chooses Nina , who works the dollar bill shredder, and Jackie , who takes bill carts from the Secret Service room to the shredding room. It takes some work to persuade Nina to join, but Jackie joins them quickly. The plan is that in the Secret Service room Bridget will switch a cart's official Master-brand lock with a near identical lock she purchased at Home Depot. Bridget will tell Jackie the cart number and give Nina the official lock. When Jackie gets the chosen cart, she dumps some bills from the cart into a trash can before taking the cart to Nina, who then uses Bridget's key to open it and restores the official lock, and then proceeds to shred the remaining bills. Meanwhile, Bridget, in the course of her janitorial duties, retrieves the dumped bills from the trash and splits them among Nina and Jackie in the women's restroom. Their first robbery is a success though the take is not as big as they had hoped. However, they're emboldened to do it repeatedly. Once Don and Bridget pay off their debt, Don suggests they stop before they get caught. Bridget rejects this idea and persuades Nina and Jackie to keep going. They almost get caught but they end up cutting in Barry, one of the security guards, who is attracted to Nina. A Federal Bank Examiner shows up at a party at Bridget's house, and the next day Bridget sees him at work. The Examiner confronts Glover , who is unwilling to admit anyone has stolen a single bill out of his bank as a matter of professional pride. Tipped off, that night Bridget and her accomplices begin trying to get rid of all the loot stashed in their houses, but the cops move in before all the evidence is destroyed. Bridget escapes but the others get caught. Bridget hires a tax attorney to defend them. The lawyer gets Bridget and all her accomplices off the hook for their crimes, because neither the law enforcement, nor the examiner can prove that the large stash of cash in their homes came from the Federal Reserve Bank. Technically, it isn't illegal to have a couple hundred thousand dollars in cash lying around inside a private residence. However, they spent a large sum of that stolen cash to buy expensive objects and improvements on their houses, and did not pay the taxes for them because they couldn't justify the income. The IRS demands they pay their taxes, which turn out to be equal in amount to the money that still remains. Eight months later, Bridget reveals to Nina and Jackie that she had stashed away much of the stolen money in the basement of a friend's bar.

2266239Leon , a genius, summons five college students to his apartment and challenges them to participate in his latest game creation: The Great All-Nighter. He tells them about his game and instructs them to form teams. At first, the leaders refuse to play. However, rivalries between them lead all five to change their minds by the game's start time. The game works like this: # Teams are given an initial clue to solve. # When the clue is solved, it will lead to a location. # At that location they must find and solve another clue leading to another location and eventually the end. Leon, as ""game master,"" keeps track of the teams locations with a giant map, and various radio equipment. The teams are supposed to call and check in at each clue . Starting at sundown, the five teams meet and are given envelopes with the first clue. They travel around Los Angeles, deciphering new clues in various locations, including the Griffith Observatory, a piano museum, the Pabst Blue Ribbon brewery, a restaurant, a mini golf course, the Los Angeles International Airport, and a video arcade. The first team to reach the final destination, a room in the Westin Bonaventure Hotel, wins the game. The movie focuses mainly on the struggle between the yellow and blue teams. The adventures of the other three teams are subplots, as well as the situation at Leon's apartment . Here, along with his female assistants , Leon monitors the progress of the game. Already unpopular with his landlady, Mrs. Grimhaus, for the amount of noise he makes, Leon faces eviction if any of the other tenants complain. Several of them do show up to complain, but as Leon explains the mechanics of the game to them, they become fascinated with it and help run it, much to the annoyance of Grimhaus. The game culminates in a race-to-the-finish at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel, followed by a huge party.  Teams are made up of characters who are broad stereotypes. They wear matching sweatshirts, and ride in vehicles that also match their team color. *The members of the Yellow Team are all friendly, and kind; they play fair and are the main heroes of the film. The yellow team are led by the protagonist Adam . The Yellow team picks up an additional member, Adam's troubled younger brother Scott , partway through the game, who acts out to get Adam's attention. They also force the shy Flynch , whom Adam has been counseling, to play the game rather than allow him to go on a date with an ugly girl. Also on the team are Laura , Adam's love interest, and Marvin , another friend of Adam's. The team vehicle, owned by Marvin, is often referred to as a Jeep but it is actually a Toyota Land Cruiser. *The members of the Blue Team are all selfish, rude, and unattractive individuals who cheat at every opportunity. They are led by overweight snob Harold , who is intensely jealous of the popular Adam. Melio  purposely instigates fights between Harold and his girlfriend, Lucille, who puts Harold on a diet just before the game starts. ""Blade,"" a Mexican-American who is constantly brandishing his switchblade knife, never speaks. An additional member, Barf , is apparently mentally challenged. The team vehicle is a Chevy van equipped with a computer that can solve clues; however, this device is destroyed early on when Harold hides a stash of marshmallows in the circuitry. *The Green Team, also known as the ""Meat Machine,"" is made up of jocks from the school's football team. They are led by Lavitas ; Dirk Blocker is also on the team. Their antagonism leads both the Red and White teams into playing. The team vehicle is a Volkswagen Beetle named the ""Meat Wagon."" *The White Team is made up of debate team nerds, led by Wesley . The White Team rides matching Puch mopeds which they eventually share with the Red team after their vehicle is destroyed. *The Red Team is made up of four members of an unpopular sorority led by Donna, played by Maggie Roswell. Two of the members are a set of frequently giggling, overweight twins  and the other two are feminists. The Red team's vehicle is a Datsun pickup truck, which is eventually destroyed by the Green team.
1535983The 1919 Chicago White Sox are considered the greatest team in baseball and, in fact, one of the greatest ever assembled to that point. However, the team's owner, Charles Comiskey, is a skinflint with little inclination to reward his players for a spectacular season. When a gamblers gets wind of the players' discontent, it offers a select group of Sox &mdash; including star pitcher Eddie Cicotte &mdash; more money to play badly than they would have earned by winning the World Series against the Cincinnati Reds. A number of players, including Chick Gandil, Swede Risberg, and Lefty Williams, go along with the scheme. The team's greatest star, Shoeless Joe Jackson, is depicted as being not very bright and not entirely sure what is going on. Buck Weaver, meanwhile, is included with the seven others but insists that he wants nothing to do with the fix. When the best-of-nine series begins, Cicotte deliberately pitches poorly to lose the first game. Williams does likewise in Game 2, while Gandil and Hap Felsch make glaring mistakes on the field. Several of the players become upset, however, when the various gamblers involved fail to pay their promised money up front. Chicago journalists Ring Lardner and Hugh Fullerton grow increasingly suspicious. Meanwhile, the team's manager, Kid Gleason, continues to hear rumors of a fix, but he remains confident that his boys will come through in the end. A third pitcher not in on the scam, Dickey Kerr, wins Game 3 for the Sox, making both gamblers and teammates uncomfortable. Other teammates such as Ray Schalk continue to play hard, while Weaver and Jackson show no visible signs of taking a dive. Cicotte, who won 29 games during the season, loses again in Game 4. With the championship now in jeopardy, Gleason intends to bench him from his next start, but Cicotte begs for another chance. The manager reluctantly agrees and is rewarded with a victory in Game 7. Unpaid by the gamblers, Williams also intends to do his best, but when his wife's life is threatened, he purposely pitches badly to lose the final game. Cincinnati wins the World Series  to the shock of Sox fans. Even worse, sportswriter Fullerton exposes the strong possibility that this series was not on the level. His findings cause Comiskey and the other owners to appoint a new commissioner of baseball, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, and give him complete authority over the sport. Eight players are indicted and brought to trial. Cicotte, Williams, and Jackson even sign confessions. But in court, while Weaver maintains his innocence, the confessions are mysteriously found to be stolen, and the popular Chicago players are found not guilty. While they celebrate, however, Judge Landis bans all eight from professional baseball for life, citing their failure to reveal being approached by gambling interests in the first place. Weaver is among those exiled from the game. The final scene shows him in the bleachers of a New Jersey minor league ballpark, watching Jackson play under an assumed name.

1745296An equine farmer discovers dead bodies and is killed by one of the assailants himself. Meanwhile, attackers use special explosives to break into an NSA bunker beneath the equine farm. There, NSA Agent Augustus Gibbons fends off the attackers before barely escaping himself. Lieutenant Alabama ""Bama"" Cobb is later revealed to be responsible for the attack on the bunker. After escaping the attack, Gibbons tells his assistant, Agent Toby Shavers, that the new XXX must be more off the grid than Xander Cage was, in other words, more attitude. So he meets up with Lieutenant Darius Stone who was jailed for 20 years whilst serving in the navy for disobeying orders and breaking General George Deckert's jaw. Later, Gibbons poses as Stone's lawyer and makes a deal with him in prison. Stone, who had been in prison at Leavenworth for assaulting Deckert, makes a daring escape. Stone is later told to recover a hard drive from the NSA bunker, while trying to escape Agent Kyle Steele at the same time, and is rescued by Shavers. Some time later, Gibbons appears to be attacked in his home and murdered, with Deckert covering up the plot. Afterwards, Stone meets up with Gibbons' contact, a beautiful blonde named Charlie Mayweather, to get information and go to her safe house, but is framed so that it will appear that he murdered 3-Star General Jack Pettibone, whom Cobb and Charlie actually killed. The police arrive, and Steele enters the house and makes a deal with Stone, while Shavers later hacks into the NSA to retrieve Deckert's plans. Afterwards, Stone infiltrates Deckert's troops aboard the USS Independence and discovers Gibbons is not dead, but being held prisoner by Deckert. Apparently Deckert is setting them up. Stone is discovered by Charlie . Gibbons orders him to escape and leave him. After retrieving the blueprints of Deckert's plot, Stone gets into an M-2 Bradley Armored Fighting vehicle and fights his way out of the ship, destroying a tank commandeered by Cobb's men to kill him. He briefly converses with the lieutenant and realizes that Deckert is planning a coup. Stone makes contact with Steele and shows him the plans; stating his view that Deckert is plotting to attack the Capitol. Steele counters Stone by insisting that Deckert is guarding the Capitol, not invading it. Stone insists this is a cover, then leaves in frustration with Steele's disbelief. During a conversation with Deckert, Steele realizes Stone was right, because Deckert lets it slip that he knows that Gibbons is still alive. He finds Stone and tells him Deckert wants to kill the president and his successors so that he can take his place. Steele suggests they go off the grid. Stone, Steele, and Shavers enlist the aid of his former gang leader, Zeke, and his crew to fight Deckert's force. Together they rob an 18 wheeler, secretly hauling guns and equipment under the guise of a cheese truck. On the night of Deckert's plan, they make their move, driving though the backs of buildings and warehouses. They end up carjacking a tank , and Stone helps Steele infiltrate the Capitol building. After some gunfights , Deckert, with Cobb, abducts the President while he is making the State of the Union Address. They escape on a bullet train. Stone pursues the bullet train by car and makes it aboard; destroying the car in the process. He engages Cobb in hand-to-hand combat and finally kills him by causing an explosion. Stone fights Deckert while helping the president escape in an adjacent helicopter. Stone leaps from the fleeing train while Gibbons destroys it with a missile, obliterating Deckert. The flaming wreckage from the train lights Stone in a silhouette as he dives into the river below, narrowly avoiding the wreckage that plunges in after him. The President awards Agent Steele and the Unknown Soldier  the Medal of Honor, as Stone goes back to his thug-esque lifestyle. Deckert receives full honors at his funeral, somewhat to Stone's disgust. He and Lola part with her, leaving him the Mustang, and he drives off; the xXx tattoo can be seen on the back of his neck. In the now rebuilt NSA Headquarters, Gibbons, Steele and Shavers discuss what kind of person the next xXx agent should be; farther off the grid, a fresh face, a new model. Gibbons says that he has the perfect candidate.

16266637The great detective Sherlock Holmes and his trusted companion Dr. John Watson travel to New York City to investigate a recent threat made by Professor Moriarty. During their investigation, Holmes and Watson are reunited with their old acquaintance Irene Adler, now a popular music-hall singer, who reveals that Moriarty has kidnapped her son. Moriarty has also left a note for Holmes informing him that he will be approached by the police soon for aid in a crime, and should he not refuse- Moriarty also informing him that he should provide no reason for his refusal- the boy will die. Holmes is subsequently contacted by the NYPD regarding the recent apparent theft at the New York bank, with the entire vault of gold bars having vanished seemingly overnight. To protect the child, Holmes refuses the case, but he and Watson later manage to track down and rescue the boy, thus removing Moriarty's blackmail card. Investigating the vaults, and quickly ruling as impossible the actual removal of many tonnes of gold via a narrow tunnel in the time available, Holmes swiftly determines what has taken place; based on the speed of the lift's descent, it should take them 45 seconds to reach the vaults, but they stopped after only 42 seconds. From this, Holmes deduces that Moriarty had an empty, duplicate vault built a few metres above the real one, subsequently planting wooden boards to stop the lift reaching the real vault. While everyone puzzled over how the bars were stolen from the false vault, Moriarty would actually be stealing them from the real one below. The case is solved. As Holmes and Adler say their goodbyes, Adler comments that her son has a keen intellect and a certain knack for solving puzzles, implying that Holmes may be his father. The two nevertheless part ways with Adler giving Holmes a picture of her son to keep.

4503438The story begins with the end of winter, and the southern ocean showing the aurora australis. A flock of penguins, coming from the north, returns home. The females separate from their mates to go hunt as males build their nests from piles of pebbles. The females return to lay their eggs, only to eventually separate from the males again, whilst the males take care of the eggs. A flock of aggressive seagulls constantly threatens to steal the penguin eggs and raids the nesting grounds while the females are away. A father  of a couple saves the egg of another family, meanwhile one of their two eggs is stolen from their nest. When the mother  returns, the father says that one of the eggs is not theirs. They return one of the eggs and have one egg for themselves. When the eggs finally hatch, the egg that is kept hatches into a blue and white male penguin named Scamper . He meets a pink and white female penguin, and attends ""school"". The students are educated by a wise, old grandfather-figure penguin that is black and white. They have a physical fitness coach who is also blue and white. The teacher and the coach bear a resemblance to Scamper's  parents. The teacher educates them about an elephant seal. While the seal yawns, the teacher observes and describes its mouth. Once the seal finishes yawning, it chomps on the teacher's head, but he is released unharmed. The physical fitness coach teaches the young penguins how to slide. Much later, she will teach them how to swim. She must stay alert because the penguins cannot swim yet, as the water is too cold. Scamper , like any other young penguin, is over-inquisitive and very curious. His adventurous personality is encouraged by the teacher, whom Scamper  takes his advice literally. Furthermore, he wanders off often, and gets in trouble with his father. In one of his adventures, he meets a dog, a husky named Cowboy  and his human guardian, who are on a scientific expedition. Momentarily he decides to with his best friend Snowflake , escape again. Scamper  introduces Snowflake  to Cowboy , but Scamper  is attacked again by an seagull, which Cowboy  grabbed and assaulted. The scientist heals Scamper 's wounds. Later, the two penguins crash towards the water . They are stranded on the ice because they still cannot swim. Once they mature, they would grow more feathers to insulate from the water, but they are still too young. They are unable to call for help, and they cannot find any food to eat. They find a group of xenophobic Emperor Penguins, which ignore their cries for help. They are attacked by a leopard seal, who is attacked itself by an orca. The orca ignores the penguins, who are now on a much smaller block of ice. The two penguins are rescued by the crew of a ship. The penguins think that the crew is of gentle scientists, but are mistaken. The men are poachers and they throw the penguins into a cage. They have a neighbor, who is a male, black feathered, macaroni penguin. They also attempt to befriend another dog, a Saint Bernard. Once they escape, they eat a disc-shaped food. They are chased by the poachers. The Saint Bernard howls, and the crew of the ship take cover because they think there is a storm approaching. The Saint Bernard gives them a life saver which they float onto another block of ice. They have grown now, and can swim and eat. Once the penguins return home. The coach alerts the rest of the community that the teacher has been shot and the students have been captured in a net. The coach stays to care for the teacher, while Scamper's  father leads a rescue. The poachers end up caught in a tidal wave which was caused by their gunshots echoing. The story ends as the dark winter comes, and the penguins go northward again, now led by Scamper. The macaroni penguin later decides to find his own community.

3950291Madrid, Christmas 1970: with the nation under a state of emergency ordered by the Franco regime, a young prostitute, Isabel Plaza Caballero , gives birth on a bus to a son she names Victor. Twenty years later, Victor Plaza  shows up for a date he made with Elena , a junkie with whom he had sex a week earlier. Waiting for her dealer to arrive, Elena is not interested in seeing Victor and tells him to leave. Finally she gets a gun and orders him out of the flat. Enraged, Victor wrestles the gun from her; in the process Elena gets knocked out, and the gun goes off. A neighbor hears the shot and calls the police; and two cops respond to the report. The older cop, Sancho , is an unstable alcoholic who suspects his wife Clara  of infidelity. The younger cop, David , more clean-cut and sober, prefers to do things by the book. Through the window they catch sight of Victor physically struggling with Elena, and Sancho is ready to storm in, while David wants to call for a back-up. When they enter, Victor holds Elena hostage with her gun. David tries to calm him down and get him to drop his gun, but Sancho sabotages his efforts by continually threatening Victor. Finally, David puts his gun to Sancho's head, gets him and Victor to put down their guns and orders Elena to flee. Sancho then lunges for Victor, they wrestle for the gun, and another shot rings out, hitting David. Two years later, Victor, in jail, watches a wheelchair basketball match: the now partially paralyzed David is a star player in the 1992 Summer Paralympics, with Elena, who is now his wife, cheering him on from the sidelines. Victor has made good use of his time, taking a correspondence course in education, working out, and enriching his mind with a variety of subjects, including the Bible. Before he is released, another four years later, his mother dies and leaves him some money and a house in the slums. One of his first stops after he gets out of jail is his mother's grave, where he encounters Elena at her father's funeral. While leaving the cemetery he meets Clara, Sancho's wife. Elena, now off drugs and operating an orphanage, tells David of her encounter with Victor. David stops by Victor's house and warns him not to go near his wife. Victor queries how he can do this, but David grabs his genitals and he doubles up. When David gets into his car to leave, he sees Clara arriving, and stay on to watch from a distance. Attracted by Victor's enthusiasm and good looks, Clara agrees to teach him how to make love, as well as pampering him with gifts and affection. She eventually falls in love with him. Victor begins to volunteer at the orphanage, which is happy to have him because he fixed the boiler, has a degree in education and is very good with the children. Elena objects, but can't find a compelling reason to throw Victor out. David continues to trail Victor and finds out that Victor works at Elena's orphanage. He confronts him again; Victor tells him that it was Sancho who made Victor squeeze the trigger. Afterwards, David tells his wife what Victor said, and the revealing context that Sancho shot David because he was having an affair with Clara. Elena is disgusted, but still plans to leave the orphanage to get away from Victor. Victor tells Elena that his original plan of revenge was to become the world's greatest lover, make love to Elena all night long, and then leave her hanging, but that he still loves her too much to do so. Victor tells Clara that they should stop meeting, and they break up. While Victor is on night-shift at the orphanage, Elena comes in to remove her belongings, and agrees to a night of passion with Victor, on condition that he never contacts her again. Elena tells David herself about her infidelity, and although she plans to stay with him, he plots his own revenge. Clara leaves Sancho, who was abusing her, shooting him in the process. David shows up at Sancho's place with photographic proof of Victor and Clara's affair. Sancho and David drive to Victor's house, where Sancho shoots and kills Clara, while Clara also wounds Sancho, and Sancho finally kills himself. At the end, David narrates a letter written to his wife from Miami, where he is spending Christmas with some friends, apologizing for the way everything turned out. While at the orphanage, a pregnant Elena goes into labor and on the way to the hospital, she and Victor get stuck in heavy traffic. Victor is reminded of the circumstances of his own birth, and tells his unborn child that the fears of the Spanish have passed.

They are both expelled from the temple after Tienbo almost kills a fellow student who cheats in a fight against him. Aided in their escape by their sympathetic teacher, they receive final instructions regarding the potential paths of their different personalities, with a specific warning given to Tienbo. They both then go into the outside world to find their way in life. Meanwhile, a gang of henchmen are forcibly taking money from a local shop owner. A woman named Miss Li steals the money and returns it. Having noticed the money gone, the henchmen start to fight with Miss Li. Miss Li holds her own during the fight, but soon gets into a bit of trouble due to her being outnumbered. Junbao comes to her aid and defeats the gang. Army reinforcements arrive to break up the fight and so the trio run away to escape capture. At this moment the eunuch governor travels through the town, roughing up the locals as he does so. Tienbo realizes that he wants to be as rich and powerful as the governor, but Miss Li warns him that he has ""a heart of a viper"" and wonders if he could handle this power. Miss Li then shows them to a pub to get food. Inside the pub, they find a woman named Siu Lin. Siu Lin is searching for her lost husband, during which she supports herself by playing on a sanxian that said husband gave to her as a gift. She finds him inside the pub as the new husband of the governor's niece. The niece starts a battle with Sui Lin where they both seem equal, but the husband hits Siu Lin on her head with a stool causing her to collapse. Junbao helps Siu Lin by defending her against her ex-husband and the niece's guards. The next day, while Junbao and Tienbo are making money with their amazing kung fu skills, the governor's second in command spots them and is impressed with Tienbo's abilities  He offers him to join the army  however, Junbao is more reluctant to do so and declines going with Tienbo and so the two go their separate ways. Later, some soldiers come to the pub to collect taxes  but Junbao and the rebels  fight and kills them one by one. One soldier escapes alive and starts off towards the army's camp to warn them about the rebels with Junbao in pursuit. Just in front of the army encampment, Tienbo kills the soldier before he warns the rest of the army about the rebels whereabouts. Tienbo warns Junbao to stay clear of the rebels as they'll get him into trouble. Now knowing where the rebels are hiding however, Tienbo takes this unique opportunity to gain a promotion. He sets a trap for Junbao and the rebels by telling them that the army is on patrol and when would be the best time to attack them. Junbao and Siu Lin collect all the rebels from the region, and go to the army camp . A big battle occurs where most of the rebels die. Tienbo captures Miss Li and Siu Lin. In the end, the only survivors are Junbao and a few rebels. Because of the trap, the governor promotes Tienbo to lieutenant. With his new authority  Tienbo kills Miss Li, and holds Siu Lin as bait so that he can try to convert Junbao to the army's cause. This is unsuccessful and Junbao rescues her. Due to the fact that his best friend betrayed him, Junbao's mind snaps and he goes crazy for days. While recuperating in the countryside with Siu Lin, he has a sudden epiphany that leads to him regaining his mental health and inspiration for the creation of the martial art of Tai Chi Chuan. While the governor is traveling to Beijing to see the emperor with his sister, they encounter Junbao and Siu Lin who kill the soldiers guarding them and also kills the niece. With the governor captured as a hostage, they go to the army camp and demand Tienbo to surrender his wealth and his power. Due to his arrogance, Tienbo declines and starts to fight Junbao thinking that he is still the inferior fighter. To Tienbo's surprise, however, Junbao is now fighting using the heretofore unseen style of Tai Chi Chuan. Because the style relies less on size, power, speed and strength, Junbao is able to fend off Tienbo with ease. Seeking an additional advantage in their fight, Tienbo kills the governor in order to gain complete control over the troops surrounding them. Siu Lin intervenes and convinces them not to listen to Tienbo as he just betrayed their leader. Seeing this , the troops back off and leave Tienbo's fate to Junbao. After a stunning series of parries and blows by Junbao, Tienbo is defeated and ultimately killed due to his reluctance to accept fate and admit defeat. After the fight Siu Lin and Junbao go their separate ways with Junbao returning to the Shaolin temple and establishing his own school to teach Tai Chi Chuan.
28147804The film starts with a short introduction to the history of Portuguese exploration in the Age of Discovery to India, referring the legendary landing of explorer Vasco da Gama on 20 May 1498 in Calicut, the kingdom ruled by Zamorins of Calicut. The typical Primary School teachers narration  is initially accompanied with Google Image Search on ""Vasco da Gama"", followed by stills from his journey and moving images at the end. The meeting of Vasco da Gama  with Zamorin with traditional hospitality, and the failed interview to produce any concrete results is also depicted. Then the celebrations of the greatest discovery till in Lisbon is shown . In a party, da Gama is seen talking to his young son, Estêvão, who will later turn crucial character in the film. The scene changes to a club in present day Goa, where we see two young men, Krishna Das  and his friend, dancing. These two young men are running a music troupe and are completely unaware of the history or heritage of their land. From the agents of a multinational mining cooperation, Krishna Das knows that his ancestral property in Kerala leased out to a N. G. O. by his late mother is rich in minerals and is free to be sold as the lease period has lapsed. The company offers him a large of money as advance. Krishna Das is told that there some problems exist, that he has to convince the people running the N. G. O. for this transaction. When he reaches the plot, he is kidnapped by some tribal  men to cave deep in the forest, and where he meets their chief Thangachan . Thangachan explains to him that he is the descendant of Chirakkal Kelu Nayanar, and Thangachan resumes the narration. The narration continues with Portuguese activities in India, and effects of Colonization on the Malabar Coast. In 1502, Gama commanded the 4th Portuguese Armada to India, a fleet of fifteen ships and eight hundred men, with the object of enforcing Portuguese interests in the east. On reaching India in October 1502, Gama started capturing any Arab vessel he came across in Indian waters. On his way to Cannanore when he had reached the northern parts of the Indian Ocean, Gama waited for a ship to return from Mecca and seized all the merchandise on it. The Portuguese chases the pilgrim ship down, which surrenders rather quickly, probably imagining that its master and they had enough money to ransom it off. But Vasco da Gama shrugs off all the offers. The general of the king of Kolathunad, Chirakkal Kothuwal , sends a Brahmin negotiator and his own son, Kelu, to the Portuguese ship ""São Gabriel"" for negotiations on a Mecca Ship, ""Miri"". But, da Gama rejects all peace talks and barbarously cut off the Brahmin's ears and sews ears of his dog on the same spot. He then ordered the hundreds of passengers be locked in the hold and Mîrî, and which contained many wealthy Muslim merchants – to be set on fire. It took several days to finally go down completely, and general of the king of Kolathunad, Chirakkal Kothuwal storms ""São Gabriel"" to rescue his son, Kelu. But, on this charismatic attempt Chirakkal Kothuwal loses his life to the Portuguese, and only Kelu escapes devastated by his fathers loss. Vavvali, a Tamil Muslim boy, takes Kelu with him to his dwelling, and treats him as his own younger brother. Kelu forms an Urumi, specially made with the left over ornaments of the dead women and children of ""Miri"". He takes an oath that he will kill da Gama. Then it shows a foreshadowing of Kelu  and Vavvali  as adults hunting rabbits in a forest somewhere in Kolathunad. Where they are confronted by some strangers trying to abduct Bala , the princess of Kolathunad. Kelu and Vavvali save the princess, but they are subsequently captured by the soldiers of Kolathiri, accompanied by the heir apparent, Bhanu Vikraman  of Chirakkal. They are charged with attempted kidnap of the Princess and keeping foreign weapons such as pistol. Originally the pistol belonged to the real abductors, but the king's judgement was the execution by elephant. On the way, Princess Bala comes and reveals that these men are in fact saviours, not attempted abductors. Soon thereeafter they are told by the King to capture de Gama, however they instead capture de Gama's son. In the process, they come across Princess Ayesha of Arackel, a fiery warrior princess who fights any justice in her kingdom. However, as Vavvali and Kelu make their way through the kingdom having captured de Gama's son, they witness several men from the kingdom of Chirakkal gathering up the women who have been affected by the battle . Back in Chirakkal, the king bestow's Kelu with the honour of being the new general. Vavvali however is slightly unhappy as the king neglected to acknowledge his role in the capture of de Gama's son. Later, the women of Arackel are brought before the king. He immediately begins to ogle at them, especially Ayesha. She however, insists that she would be better suited for Bhanu than the king, to which the king agrees. Ayesha prepares for a night with Bhanu, however Bhanu  had initially had his eye on a young girl among the group. When he mentions that he wished that she too could join him, Ayesha strangles him. This had been her plan from the start, a plan foiled when palace guards arrive and take her away after Kelu restrains her. The king orders that she be 'spoiled' so that no one will dare to look at her ever again. As she is being taken away in a cage by guards, Kelu arrives and frees her. He tells her to leave and never return. Ayesha soon returns however to help the other women of Arackel still facing sexual and physical abuse at the hands of the king, Prince Bhanu and other men of the palace. At the same time, Kelu decides to help the women escape, as well as take de Gama's son from the king's custody – he feels that the king may not be the right person to seek in fighting against de Gama. Vavvali was supposed to bring de Gama, but in a mix-up de Gama is recaptured and Vavvali seen as the hero who caught him – he is given the honour of being co-general to the king with Kelu. Meanwhile, Kelu takes the women to safety in a nearby village; they are given medical attention. He then gives his urumi to Ayesha telling her to safeguard the women while he returns to Chirakkal to see what happened to Vavvali and de Gama's son. In Chirakkal he realises what has happened, and tells Vavvali that they must start their revolution against de Gama. They set out to all the nearby villages, with Ayesha joining their effort, destroying all hanging structures built by the Portuguese. As their support grew among all the peasants, members of the palace start to poison the king and the Prince Bhanu that Kelu and Vavvali are going to overthrow them. Meanwhile, de Gama is planning an attack to save his son. He sends in troops to Chirakkal, where they meet with Kelu, Vavvali, and Ayesha. A battle ensues, but they fall to the strength of Kelu and his fellow warriors. As the warriors take rest after the battle, Kelu and Ayesha finally admit their feelings to one another and embrace. Meanwhile, de Gama receives a box from India containing the severed fingers of his son, angering him again. Back in India, Bhanu seeks assistance from de Gama's son to obtain guns. He then meets with de Gama, and almost gets killed. In return for sparing his life, Bhanu helps de Gama's son escape. Bhanu also retrieves a deed giving  to . But when his father cannot accept his actions, Bhanu kills the king with the gun received from de Gama's son. News of the king's death reaches Kelu and his warriors. Kelu returns to discuss with Bhanu  what actions to take against de Gama, but Bhanu hesitantly states that the kingdom's army will not longer take orders from him. Kelu then confronts the member of the palace  who has poisoned the king's son's intentions. Meanwhile, de Gama's son returns to de Gama's fort. The princess of Chirakkal also asks Vavvali to take her with him, as she feels ashamed that her own brother killed their father. Vavvali agrees and takes her away with the help of some of the palace guards. Meanwhile, de Gama and his son return to Chirakkal to meet with Bhanu. Thinking it a friendly visit, Bhanu welcomes them only to be killed. Soon thereafter, de Gama comes with his troops in search of Kelu and his warriors. Initially it seems that de Gama's troops are retreating after losing heavily in the battle, but then de Gama's son shoots Vavvali. As Vavvali says his last words to Kelu  de Gama's son returns to his father to update him on their progress. de Gama instructs him to go back to battle. Kelu sets off to battle with a large army including Muslim Mappilas and Syrian Christians, coming face-to-face with de Gama's son and his army.

Phil is a tax lawyer while Claire is a realtor. They are motivated to reignite their romance after learning that their best friends, Brad and Haley , are planning to divorce to escape the married-life routine and to have more excitement in their lives. To avoid the routine that had become their weekly ""date night"", Phil decides that he will take Claire to a trendy Manhattan restaurant called ""Claw"", but they cannot get a table. Phil steals a reservation from a no-show couple, the Tripplehorns, despite Claire's misgivings. While eating they are approached by two men, Collins ([[Common  and Armstrong , who question them about a flash drive they believe Phil and Claire stole from mobster Joe Miletto . Phil and Claire try to explain that they are not the Tripplehorns, but the men threaten them at gunpoint. Not seeing any other way out, Phil tells them the flash drive is in a boathouse in Central Park. At the boathouse, Claire pretends to search; while Collins and Armstrong's backs are turned, Phil hits them with an oar and escapes with Claire on a boat, Collins and Armstrong shooting at them. At a police station, Phil and Claire talk with Detective Arroyo , but discover Collins and Armstrong are also detectives, presumably on Miletto's payroll. Realizing they cannot trust the police, they decide to find the real Tripplehorns. They return to the restaurant and find the Tripplehorns' phone number. Claire remembers a former client, Holbrooke Grant , is a security expert and James Bond-like action hero. He seems to never wear shirts and is sleeping with a gorgeous Israeli woman . At his apartment, Grant traces the Tripplehorns' cell phone signal to an apartment owned by a Tom Felton. Collins and Armstrong arrive, but Phil and Claire escape in Grant's Audi R8. They arrive at Felton's apartment and break in. They question Felton, nicknamed ""Taste"" , and his wife ""Whippit""  about the flash drive and Joe Miletto. It turns out that Taste and Whippit did go to the restaurant but left as soon as they spotted Collins and Armstrong outside. Realizing they are still in danger, Taste gives the flash drive to Phil and flees with Whippit. When Phil and Claire get back in the Audi, Armstrong and Collins chase and shoot at them. Phil and Claire crash the Audi head-on into a Ford Crown Victoria taxicab, resulting in their Audi and the cab being attached at the bumpers. Both windshields are shot out, so Phil and the cab driver  agree to drive off under the Audi's power to get away. Phil climbs into the cab to help control it  while Claire drives the Audi, Collins and Armstrong still pursuing along with other NYPD vehicles. Phil checks the flash drive on the cab driver's Amazon Kindle and finds pictures of district attorney Frank Crenshaw  with prostitutes . After evading Collins and Armstrong, they are eventually hit, and are separated by, an SUV. Phil realizes that the cab's brakes have failed so the cab driver  jumps free and Phil rides the car into the river; Phil swims away and later says the flash drive stayed in the river. On a subway train, Phil learns that Felton had obtained the flash drive to blackmail Crenshaw on behalf of Miletto. They return to Grant's apartment, and Grant reluctantly agrees to help them again. Phil and Claire go to an illegal strip club that Crenshaw frequents, with Claire under the guise of a new prostitute and Phil as her pimp. After doing a pole dance for Crenshaw, they confront him and tell him they are the Tripplehorns. Collins and Armstrong come in and hold them at gunpoint, taking them up to the roof with Crenshaw. Miletto arrives with henchmen and it is revealed that Crenshaw has been paid by Miletto to keep him out of jail. When Phil mentions the photos, a fight escalates between the mobsters and Crenshaw, Collins and Armstrong. Phil asks Claire to count to three, her typical method of calming their children. When she does, a helicopter appears and Arroyo and the SWAT team come onto the roof to arrest Miletto, Crenshaw, and everyone else. It is revealed that Phil was wearing a wire courtesy of Grant, who had informed Arroyo of the situation. Afterwards, Phil and Claire have breakfast at a diner, where Phil says he would marry Claire and have their kids all over again. When they return home, they make love on the front lawn."

He is due to marry Vinni in one weeks time and he's got cold feet. In fact, he's got frostbite. His friend, Little Ted, a scheming, sexually frustrated cartoonist is obsessed with Vinni, even though he dumped her when they went out together. Both Little Ted and Hal have their own plans to disrupt the imminent wedding and they separately call upon Mr.Mac, a world weary swimming coach, to help them out. On Hal's all day stag night, Little Ted sets in motion a disastrous chain of events when he persuades Mr.Mac to convince Petula,  to seduce Hal in a pub lavatory so that he can record it on Polaroid. Hal, in the meantime, wants Mr.Mac to seduce Vinni so that he can catch them in flagrante, giving him the excuse to call off the wedding. Meanwhile, Vinni has decided that she has no intention of marrying Hal and gate-crashes the pub crawl in order to finally have things out with him. In this Machiavellian comedy of errors, there is no saying who will end up with whom.

Without vaccinations it could re-emerge and re-infect regions where it was eradicated decades ago, and the film also notes that the first line of defense is a dedicated and continual effort by international health workers going door-to-door to ensure every child is vaccinated. The Final Inch shows that there is an opportunity to eradicate polio from India and honors the work of health services and service volunteers. It recalls the devastating polio epidemics in the United States that occurred during the 1930s and 1950s, and discusses the dangers of a resurgence that still remain in the United States unless the disease is wiped out worldwide. Obstacles to eradication include lack of awareness, the large number of children requiring vaccination, geographical dispersal of the populations, social mores, religious beliefs, and suspicion of domestic and foreign governments.

Arthur denies that he is a murderer, a crime for which his former partner, Willie Grimes , has already been executed by guillotine. However, Blake freely admits to being a grave robber, and begins to recount his career with Willie. Arthur became Willie's apprentice following the death of Blake's father, forcing the young man to find a job to support his family. Willie quickly taught him the skills necessary to steal corpses, both from graves as well as more risky locations, such as wakes. The job proved profitable on its face, but both Arthur and Willie's ability to make money was severely hampered by the interference of Doctor Quint , who frequently blackmailed the two into obtaining corpses for free under threat of notifying the police of their activities. This blackmail continued for numerous years. Willie and Arthur's career changed abruptly when procuring another corpse for Quint. Digging up a corpse buried at a cross-roads, the two were confused when they found a garlic wreath around the body's neck and a wooden stake in its chest. Arthur dismissed these things as superstition, and removed them against Willie's protests. Moments later, while the two were clearing their cart, the dead woman rose and walked away. Willie and Arthur attempted to flee, but came across the undead woman, who attacked Arthur. Willie was able to fend her off briefly with a shovel, and when she attacked him he managed to plunge the stake back into her chest, causing her to go immediately limp. Willie and Arthur delivered the staked body to Doctor Quint and departed quickly. The doctor removed the stake, awakening the undead woman, who killed him. Freed of their blackmailer and now aware of a new market for their skills, Arthur and Willie shifted their career towards the supernatural side of grave robbing. During one such job  they were stopped by Cornelius Murphy, main spokesperson for the House Murphy, an infamous and vicious band of grave robbers led by Cornelius' unseen father, Samuel. Cornelius demanded the body at knifepoint; though Willie advised him to cooperate, Arthur refused, and the three scuffled over the body until it vanished in a burst of light. At this point in Arthur's narrative Father Duffy asks him if he had any further encounters with the House Murphy. Arthur is reluctant to speak of the matter, but finally relents, discussing the next—and last—time he encountered the Murphys. Drinking at a local pub with their new apprentice  Fanny Briers , Arthur and Willie received word from pub owner Ronnie about a possible job: a local mortuary had been reported as receiving crated shipments of the undead. However, their most recent shipment was incomplete, two of the crates lost in a shipwreck and believed to be located on a nearby island. The catch was that the mortuary had already hired someone to retrieve the missing undead: House Murphy. Willie and Arthur initially turned down the job, not wishing to cross paths with the Murphys, but at Fanny's insistence the two reluctantly agreed. On the island the crates are guarded by Bulger, House Murphy's enforcer. Fanny slit his throat , then the three rounded up one of the undead, Willie suffering a bite during the effort. Before they could get to the second Fanny was killed by a knife thrown by Cornelius, who then tied the remaining two to the cage containing the captured undead. The two were only saved from death when the captured undead tore free of its cage and attacked Valentine, House Murphy's disfigured female assassin. Cornelius attempted to save Valentine, only to be attacked by the second undead. Willie and Arthur freed themselves, then escaped in the confusion. Afterward the two argued bitterly over the botched job, resulting in the end of their partnership, and friendship. A week later the two were arrested. At the conclusion of the tale Father Duffy asks whether it was Arthur or Willie who murdered Cornelius, but Arthur reiterates that the two simply left him to his fate. When Father Duffy expresses a surprising amount of anger at this, as well as the sentiment that Willie was ""lucky"" to have been killed before Duffy could meet him, Arthur realizes the priest's true identity: Samuel Murphy. The elder Murphy then attempts to kill Arthur with a mace, but before he can he is struck down by an unseen rescuer. When he is able to look up Arthur is surprised to discover his rescuer is Willie—more accurately, the decapitated body of Willie. Holding his head in one hand, Willie explains that the bite he suffered on the island seems to have rendered him undead following his execution. As the two make their way out of the prison cell Willie remarks that being undead is the best thing that ever happened to him, and even suggests that Arthur himself get bitten. When Arthur rejects the idea Willie claims he's starting to feel ""ravenous"", and jokingly chases after Arthur as they leave the prison. Unknown to them, Cornelius rises from his underwater grave."

The opening sequences, canned by the director himself, shows Shankaran Kutty- attending a temple festival. The film proceeds to show the irresponsible and often nomadic life style of Shankaran Kutty. Shankaran Kutty, though seemingly at the beginning of middle age, spends most of his time playing around with children, joining political processions and helping the villagers when he is not attending temple festivals. He is provided for by his younger sister who works as a house maid in the city of Thiruvananthapuram. His sister in an attempt to get his life organized arranges a marriage for him. But to the dismay of his new wife, Shankaran Kutty continues his life style often staying away from home for weeks. The already pregnant wife soon leaves him, and Shankaran Kutty does not make any attempt to have her back at home. Shankaran Kutty's life takes a turn from there on. His sister starts living in their family home with her new husband and slowly he finds himself out of place. Shankaran Kutty's coming of age is also shown through another sub-plot in the movie. He realizes the hard realities of human life, when the widow who used to act as a patron for him commits suicide after being cheated in love. He reaches a turning point in his life when he joins a truck driver as an assistant. Though he finds the job too much to handle at first, he slowly adapts to the new responsibilities of life. He starts making amends with his wife. The film ends when Shankaran Kutty has a happy reunion with his wife and newborn son. The film has a structure that resembles a typical Kerala temple festival. The title itself is an allusion to the first ceremony in the temple festival where a flag is hoisted to mark the beginning of the proceedings. The director commented that the film's most important connection to the festivals is the fact that in both nothing really happens; the only notable thing in both is the very presence of the people and events.

He realizes the hard realities of human life, when the widow who used to act as a patron for him commits suicide after being cheated in love. He reaches a turning point in his life when he joins a truck driver as an assistant. Though he finds the job too much to handle at first, he slowly adapts to the new responsibilities of life. He starts making amends with his wife. The film ends when Shankaran Kutty has a happy reunion with his wife and newborn son. The film has a structure that resembles a typical Kerala temple festival. The title itself is an allusion to the first ceremony in the temple festival where a flag is hoisted to mark the beginning of the proceedings. The director commented that the film's most important connection to the festivals is the fact that in both nothing really happens; the only notable thing in both is the very presence of the people and events.

The sales lady has her try on several hats, but Granny seems unsatisfied with each choice . At the same time, Sylvester is chasing Tweety outside and Tweety makes his way into the hat shop. Just as Tweety hides at a table, Sylvester runs in and tries to rummage through the hats to look for him, but the sales lady catches him in the act, and using the broom, chases him out. Just as the sales lady comes to the table where Tweety is hiding, Tweety stands real still on a hat, making the sales lady think that he's a cute little stuffed bird on a hat. After Granny tries it on, she thinks the same thing and buys the hat. Tweety soon realizes the joys of being said ""stuffed bird"" has a two-fold purpose, the second being that it is perfect refuge from Sylvester. But as usual, the puddy tat does everything to get at the bird, first following Granny out of the hat shop. The first time, Granny turns around, but sees Sylvester pretending to sleep. The second time, Granny quickly gets wise and swats the cat with her umbrella. Other failed attempts for Sylvester to get Tweety include: * Perching himself atop a delivery truck. Just as he is about to grab dinner, the truck speeds away, requiring the cat to take the crosstown bus to return downtown. Sylvester then barely avoids getting hit by an oncoming car, causing his heart to beat fast and his fur to go white. * Hiding inside an English gentleman's hat. The man walks up beside Granny and makes a snide remark, just as Sylvester is making a grab for Tweety. Granny uses her umbrella to clout the man and — unwitting — the cat. * Following Granny into Lacy's Department Store  and into an elevator. The cat's tail gets stuck in the elevator door, and when he finally disembarks the elevator, his tail has been stretched from the store's eight floors. * At J.C. Denny's , the cat snatching Granny's hat with the obvious intent of getting Tweety. Granny follows the thieving cat outside, but Sylvester makes his getaway by putting the hat on and using a balloon to float to safety ... until Tweety pops the balloon. The hat glides to the street undamaged , while Sylvester plummets into a manhole . * Later, using a bellows to blow Granny's hat from her head, causing it to go onto the street. Sylvester barely avoids getting hit by several cars and recovers the hat, but he is struck by a motorscooter driving from an alley. Granny manages to retrieve the hat safely. In the ending gag, Sylvester uses a fishing rod and reel to latch onto the hat. Granny gets into a taxi, and Sylvester is pulled away by the speeding driver. After being an unwilling car skiier for several city blocks , Sylvester eventually realizes he needs to reel himself in ... which he does to open the taxi's sunroof and grab Tweety. Just after saying his only line in the cartoon — ""Now I've got you, buster"" — the car drives into the Holland Tunnel, where the cat hits his head against the side of the entrance; the bird flies out of his hand and back safely onto the taxicab's roof.

Initially, he sets strict rules for himself regarding whom he should follow and for how long, but soon discards them as he focuses on a well-groomed, handsome man in a dark suit. The man in the suit, having noticed he is being followed, quickly confronts the Young Man and introduces himself as ""Cobb"". Cobb reveals that he is a serial burglar and invites The Young Man to accompany him on various burglaries. The material gains from these crimes seem to be of secondary importance to Cobb, who takes pleasure in rifling through the personal items in his targets' flats, and doing things such as drinking their wine. He explains that his true passion is using the shock of robbery and violation of property to make his victims re-examine their lives. He sums up his attitude thus: ""You take it away, and show them what they had."" The Young Man is thrilled by Cobb's lifestyle. He attempts break-ins of his own, as Cobb encourages and guides him. At Cobb's suggestion, he alters his appearance, cutting his hair short and wearing a dark suit. The Young Man assumes the name ""Daniel Lloyd"" based on the credit card Cobb gives to him and begins to pursue a relationship with a blonde woman whose flat he and Cobb burglarized. The Blonde turns out to be the girlfriend of a small-time gangster  whom she broke up with after he murdered a man in her flat. Soon, the Blonde confides that the Bald Guy is blackmailing her with incriminating photographs. The Young Man breaks into the Bald Guy's safe, but is caught in the act by an unidentified man. The Young Man bludgeons the man with a claw hammer and flees with the Bald Guy's money and photos. Upon returning to his flat, he finds that the photos are innocuous modeling shots. Confronting the Blonde, the Young Man learns that she and Cobb have been working together to manipulate him into mimicking Cobb's burglary methods. Cobb had recently discovered a murdered woman's body during one of his burglaries, and is attempting to deflect suspicion from himself by making it appear as though multiple burglars share his MO. The Young Man leaves to turn himself in to the police. The Blonde reports her success to Cobb, who then reveals that he actually works for the Bald Guy. The story about the murdered woman was part of a plot to deceive both the Blonde and the Young Man: The Blonde has been blackmailing the Bald Guy with evidence from the murder he committed in her flat, and he wants her murdered in such a way that it cannot be connected to him. Cobb bludgeons the Blonde to death with the same claw hammer that the Young Man used during the burglary of the Bald Guy's safe and leaves it at the scene. The police, checking out the Young Man's story, find the Blonde murdered and the claw hammer with his finger prints on it. The Young Man is implicated for all of Cobb's crimes, along with the murder of the blonde woman. Meanwhile, Cobb vanishes into a crowd."

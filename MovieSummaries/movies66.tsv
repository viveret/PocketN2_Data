At night, two New Zealand soldiers, Captain Ben Grogan ([[Craig Hall  and Sergeant Joe Tane  paddle in their Klepper canoe to Forau Island, landing on a beach covered in anti-personnel mines and tank traps. They leave the beach and head inland, walking through woods when they hear distant screaming and gunfire. They approach a German fortification and hear what they think is a man being tortured. They climb down into a large gun pit and place explosives on a large artillery gun, but are disturbed when a German soldier  runs out of a tunnel pleading for help. Grogan stabs the soldier in the back of the neck and kills him. They hear a woman screaming, and Grogan decides to investigate with Tane remaining outside. Tane, hearing a gunshot, enters the bunker to investigate. While looking for Grogan, he discovers a book of black magic, and distracted by its contents, is killed by an unseen assailant. Unharmed, Grogan discovers Tane's body and is knocked unconscious by the Nazi. Grogan wakes and is briefly tortured by a Nazi, Colonel Meyer , who wants to know his mission. During the interrogation, a woman is heard screaming from another room. Grogan eventually escapes and chases Meyer into the tunnels, shooting and injuring him. Grogan follows the sound of the woman up to a room covered in occult symbols. He finds a chained woman , who reveals herself to be his dead wife, Helena. Meyer enters the room and shoots Grogan in the leg, then shoots Helena in the head, apparently killing her. Grogan attacks Meyer, who explains the woman is a demon, summoned up from a book of black magic found on the island. Meyer proves this by offering her the leg of a dead German, and as she stops pretending to be dead, changes into her true demon form as she eats the leg. After Grogan removes a bullet from his abdomen, Meyer passes out. Grogan searches him and discovers a page torn from the book of black magic in a small pouch worn as a necklace by the Nazi. Grogan keeps the page after replacing it for another from the book. Soon after Meyer recovers and explains the demon is a shapeshifter and a weapon the Germans plan to use against the Allies. However, they realised the demon poses a world threat, so they keep it confined. Meyer offers to give the book to Grogan if he will help Meyer escape from Germany. Meyer then persuades Grogan to help him perform a ritual to dispel the demon back to Hell. Meyer, believing he is protected with the incantation sheet from the book, betrays Grogan at the end of the ritual. As Meyer reveals his true intent to use the demon for the Nazis, Grogan overpowers Meyer and throws him to the demon. She brutally kills Meyer while Grogan survives, protected by the incantation he has taken from Meyer.

At night, two New Zealand soldiers, Captain Ben Grogan ([[Craig Hall  and Sergeant Joe Tane  paddle in their Klepper canoe to Forau Island, landing on a beach covered in anti-personnel mines and tank traps. They leave the beach and head inland, walking through woods when they hear distant screaming and gunfire. They approach a German fortification and hear what they think is a man being tortured. They climb down into a large gun pit and place explosives on a large artillery gun, but are disturbed when a German soldier  runs out of a tunnel pleading for help. Grogan stabs the soldier in the back of the neck and kills him. They hear a woman screaming, and Grogan decides to investigate with Tane remaining outside. Tane, hearing a gunshot, enters the bunker to investigate. While looking for Grogan, he discovers a book of black magic, and distracted by its contents, is killed by an unseen assailant. Unharmed, Grogan discovers Tane's body and is knocked unconscious by the Nazi. Grogan wakes and is briefly tortured by a Nazi, Colonel Meyer , who wants to know his mission. During the interrogation, a woman is heard screaming from another room. Grogan eventually escapes and chases Meyer into the tunnels, shooting and injuring him. Grogan follows the sound of the woman up to a room covered in occult symbols. He finds a chained woman , who reveals herself to be his dead wife, Helena. Meyer enters the room and shoots Grogan in the leg, then shoots Helena in the head, apparently killing her. Grogan attacks Meyer, who explains the woman is a demon, summoned up from a book of black magic found on the island. Meyer proves this by offering her the leg of a dead German, and as she stops pretending to be dead, changes into her true demon form as she eats the leg. After Grogan removes a bullet from his abdomen, Meyer passes out. Grogan searches him and discovers a page torn from the book of black magic in a small pouch worn as a necklace by the Nazi. Grogan keeps the page after replacing it for another from the book. Soon after Meyer recovers and explains the demon is a shapeshifter and a weapon the Germans plan to use against the Allies. However, they realised the demon poses a world threat, so they keep it confined. Meyer offers to give the book to Grogan if he will help Meyer escape from Germany. Meyer then persuades Grogan to help him perform a ritual to dispel the demon back to Hell. Meyer, believing he is protected with the incantation sheet from the book, betrays Grogan at the end of the ritual.

A Sinhalese village girl falls in love with an army soldier and becomes pregnant. The couple attempts to abort the child but fails. While they are making love in the ruins of an abandoned building, her father happens to see them. While he does not confront her about what he has seen, the scene haunts him continuously. As the war intensifies, adult villagers are recruited into the civil defense force in order to protect the village border. Among these recruits is her father, who is punished and humiliated by the soldiers from her lover's platoon for not being on guard one day. Demoralized, he shoots himself inside an empty bunker. Meanwhile, the soldier and his platoon receive a transfer to a distant posting, leaving the girl in great agony. Tortured by her father's suicide and her rage at the soldier who leaves her pregnant, she flees the village.  A recently widowed Sinhalese woman lives with her eight children in a remote village where the armed tension between the government army and the L.T.T.E., or Tamil Tigers, escalates. Stricken with extreme poverty, she becomes a curd vendor. She also becomes involved in an affair with a young man who owns a shop in the village. Her eldest son is in his first year of high school. To support the family, the woman's eldest son works in the local fish market selling fish. Meanwhile, he falls in love with a girl at his school. He is humiliated when their relationship is revealed to the school. Meanwhile, rumors spread about his mother’s affair. One day, the boy sees his mother having sexual intercourse with her lover in a broken house. The enraged boy stabs his mother in front of his siblings later the same evening.  A young Tamil schoolgirl experiences her first menstrual period while in a bus on her way home after school. This is revealed when an army soldier subjects her to a security check at an army controlled roadblock. Her father is a clerk and her mother is a housewife; they live in a rural village in Eastern Sri Lanka, where the war between the state army and the L.T.T.E. has been intensifying. The Tamil Tigers secretly conduct their propaganda lectures in schools, demanding a separate Tamil Eelam state and justifying their war against the Sinhala-dominated southern government army. One night, the L.T.T.E. forcibly enter the Tamil girl’s house and demand a sum that the family can scarcely afford. They threaten to conscript the girl if her family fails to pay the money. On the night that her parents are supposed to pay the demanded money, the child slips away from the house just as the L.T.T.E visit them. Since the L.T.T.E. get neither the money nor the girl, they gun down her parents. The film has also been highly praised by renowned film personalities Tony Rayns & Ian Christie to name some, below are exerts from there reviews, ""...The film Is scrupulously non-partisan, deeply humane, sexually candid, coolly modernist in style and almost indecently beautiful."" ~Tony Rayns~http://filmguide.viff.org/tixSYS/2011/xslguide/eventnote.php?EventNumber=0410 In the review for the 5th Cinema Digital Seoul Film Festival he also stated: ""...stories filled with rage,suffering, sexual abandon and calamity, but the director films them with cool detachment... A work of remarkable restraint. Sri Lankan Cinema has found its true modernist"" ~ (Review, 5th Cinema Digital Seoul Film Festival  ""...flying Fish offers an extraordinary journey to the heart of Sri Lankan darkness with no less vivid, sensual images. Set during the 25-year civil war that convulsed Sri Lanka, Pushpakumara’s remarkable debut draws on his own experience growing up in a remote village, where ordinary lives were degraded by the struggle between Tamil Tigers and government forces . Recurrent close-up images of exotic insects and landscapes of startling beauty intersperse scenes of sexual exploitation, making this a far from comfortable films to watch. But there’s no denying its impassioned originality."" - ~Ian Christie~ ""Sight and Sound"" http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/newsandviews/festivals/cindi-2011.php"

Having spent two years in the backwaters, Baek, a senior agent, arrives in Gangwon and informs Rim that he has been promoted and is to return to Seoul as an analyst. February 1983. Rim has begun to assimilate with and earn the trust and respect of his fellow agents although he is still kept away from highly sensitive materials. Rim continues to listen to Yun's classical music radio program, until Yun announces the program is to end. The last musical piece played is a special request, and this transpires to be a code - Yun is a North Korean sleeper agent, and Rim is to make contact. He is a double agent, and when he contacts Yun at the radio station, she is to be his handler. Although Yun no longer has a job at the radio station, they are able to maintain contact when Baek's wife, a churchgoing acquaintance of Yun's, sets Rim up with Yun with the approval of Baek who has been wanting Rim to settle down. A relationship between the two begins to flourish. Rim passes intelligence on an upcoming mission to insert South Korean spies into North Korea via a fishing boat to Yun.

It is clear that the confession was made under duress, and suspicions have been raised about Rim's own reliability. Later, Rim is contacted by another North Korean agent who questions Rim's lack of commitment to the cause. It transpires that Rim had been ordered to eliminate Song, but Yun, who received the orders, deliberately did not pass them on.

Suddenly, his ostrich decides to make a stop, causing him to be thrown forward. While the disturbed Oswald let out his dissatisfaction, the large bird lays an egg. The egg hatches but the offspring chooses to go a separate path rather than to stay with its mother. Just nearby, an elephant was playing golf using its trunk as a club, and coconuts as balls. The elephant executes a shot but the coconut just veered away from the hole. After missing the next several shots without even scoring once, the frustrated golfer started striking the coconuts at random directions. One of them struck Oswald's ostrich, prompting that bird to quickly fled the scene. Oswald too was hit and was daze for a few seconds. Annoyed, Oswald confronts and tells the elephant to stop, threatening to attack. Not liking to be commanded by someone, the elephant gives a raspberry as Oswald turns around. Oswald then retaliates as he roughs up and wrestles the elephant to the ground. Momentarilly, the elephant's huge father came by. Seemingly intimidated by the larger pachyderm, Oswald helps the downed son get back on its feet. The smaller elephant walks away, leaving Oswald to face the wrath of its father. But Oswald wasn't actually hopeless as he reveals and opens a cage containing a mouse, much to the big elephant's panic. As the big elephant runs in terror with the mouse chasing, Oswald was laughing out loud. While he does, a squirrel silently walks by and kicks him from behind. Oswald chases the squirrel into a cave, only to be forced back out by something stronger. It turns out that the more powerful creature was a lion as it exited the cave. Oswald quickly made his getaway. While running from the lion, Oswald drops tacks on the ground but they barely slow down the big cat. When the two ran into a straw house, the tables were turned when Oswald got his hands on a shotgun which he fires at the lion. Upon running out of bullets, Oswald retreats and takes refuge inside a hollow log. To extract the rabbit from inside, the lion extends its scissor-jacked teeth into the log. Although the jaws closed on their target, the lion struggled to pull out Oswald who strongly refuses to be taken. Unfortunately for the lion, the scissor-extenders that connect to the teeth detach from its mouth. Returning the ordeal, Oswald uses the extendable teeth to bite back at the lion, and chases the big cat deep in the jungle.

Teenager Fabrice longs to pursue his ambition of becoming an association football legend and is seen breaking the local record for the most continuous football kick-ups. When Fabrice is offered the chance to audition for the opening ceremony of the 2010 Football World Cup in South Africa, he sets off for Kigali, the capital city of Rwanda, with his 'manager' Dudu and Dudu's sister Beatrice. Beatrice wishes to become a doctor and find a cure for AIDS in memory of Dudu. Fabrice tries to express his love of football to his mother, but she simply replies ""Africa doesen't need dreams, it needs to wake up"". Fabrice plucks up the courage to sneak out of home early and masquerade as a woman's child with Dudu and Beatrice the following day, in order to get to Kigali. However, they take the wrong bus and on arrival at the end of the bus route, when they look for the auditions stadium, a man states they are in Congo and that the stadium is 1000 miles away in Kinshasa. Ending up in a refuge camp in the Democratic Republic of Congo, they meet George Foreman, an ex-child soldier, who agrees to help them escape the camp. Dudu decides that the group will walk the rest of the way to South Africa  so that Fabrice can play for the ""Dream Team"" at the World Cup opening ceremony. They leave during the night in a jeep, but George's fellow soldiers catch up with them the following day. They flee the jeep just before it explodes in front of the soldiers. They end up in a dilapidated railway carriage which Beatrice assumes is a ""hotel"", on account of the shabby living conditions that she and her brother are used to. Dudu discovers that George has a bag full of money that he has stolen from the general of his ex-army. They find a leopard-like black animal in the train and so make off for the shores of Lake Tanganyika, where they hire a boat to get to Tanzania on the other side. Fabrice's mother texts and calls him on his mobile  phone, but he finally has enough and throws the phone into the middle of the lake. Eventually they arrive on the other side of the lake at a whitewhased villa, where Celeste, a sex slave, is working for the white owner by selling beverages. She catches the four children and insists they go back, but George flashes his bag of money for bribery and so the owner lets them stay and play in the pool and be waited on. Fabrice has time to play with Dudu's ""organic footballs"" . As George falls asleep, the owner steals his bag of money and throws them out of the villa; however, they soon retrieve the bag and the money and Celeste joins them. Using Dudu's business-like tactical skills, they end up in the hull of a ship full of mangoes, bound for Zambia, where they will continue the journey. Celeste reveals she ran away from her tribal village to avoid an arranged marriage, and Fabrice sees George throw away his gun, which he used to shoot his fellow soldiers earlier on. The team runs out of money, so Dudu insists they can earn some by giving blood at a local medical centre. Everyone passes the blood test except for Dudu, who is HIV-positive, although he does not reveal this to the others. After crossing the border into Zimbabwe, Dudu exchanges the Zambian kwacha for Zimbabwean dollars, but Celeste explains the currency is defunct and that he has been scammed. He tries to collect the money after it spills into the water, and the Zambezi river carries it to the precipice of Victoria Falls. During the night, Dudu develops a cough and in the morning he is rushed to a local hospital. There is a school attached to the hospital, and a school teacher Leleti Khumalo notices Beatrice's intelligence and offers her a place at the school to study for free. The doctor soon explains that, although the medical team have been able to stabilise Dudu's tuberculosis, he has a low CD4 T-cell count  and needs medication that is out of stock and won't be available for another three days. However, Dudu decides to persevere on the journey and to continues with Fabrice, George and Celeste towards the stadium: Beatrice decides to stay behind at the school to have an education and so try to fulfil her dream of becoming a doctor. The team arrive at Beitbridge on the Zimbabwe–South Africa border, where an official insists that they are nothing but refugeees. The security guards take Dudu's ball but again the team works together to retrieve it and continue to Soccer City in Johannesburg for the Cup. Dudu falls ill again and is rushed to the medical facility at the stadium, where he completes his fictional story by saying Fabrice carries the ball God gave to the people of Africa. Except for Dudu, the team carry the ball off into the now roaring crowd. At the end, Dudu is seen walking off into a light at the end of the Soccer city stadium tunnel, carrying his briefcase & custom-made ball suggesting that he has died of HIV–AIDS."

This gives him the pretext to take us on a Cook’s tour of the extremities of the Soviet Union: we see the icebreaker Lenin  delivering new dogs to the Samoyeds on Novaya Zemlya, and their being invited on board to listen to a gramophone recording of the great man himself. We go to Bukhara where one of the mosques is looking very dingy and crumbled, and to Leningrad where the trams run down the middle of broad empty boulevard as a horse-drawn carriage turns out. We see a Kirghiz with a giant eagle perched on his arm, a bear encircled by yapping dogs, a fox caught in a trap and another one that is a child’s pet, guillemots, gulls, a man shooting a sable in the top of a pine tree, a pine marten, sheep being dragged into the sea for a wash and other sheep being obliged to jump in to a stream for the same purpose - the intertitles are surreal: (“You – whether you are washing your sheep in the sea  or whether you are washing your sheep in the river …”, We see trappers bringing their furs to the Госторг  trading post in exchange for manufactured goods, everyone contributing to the national economy. Ironically, the furs are destined for the Leipzig fair . In an amazing stop-frame sequence, rows of oranges align themselves in a packing box, wadges of packing material shuffle along and jump on top of them, and then the lids close . We see coke being quenched also, as well as electricity pylons and insulators, and the village electricity co-op. We see sturgeon being hoiked out of tanks to make caviar. We see barrels of butter – 'it is yours!' We see wheat being threshed, linen being spun and cotton being ginned. We see the country being modernised, although there are still some people who trust in Mohammed  or Christ  or Buddha  and we are shown a Siberian shaman looking remarkably like a North American Indian, and even a reindeer being slaughtered  as a sacrifice. We see crowds of women in full-face veils, but also a modernising country as a woman lifts her veil. And we see some tundra-dwellers eating raw reindeer meat. It’s a fantastic travelogue and anthropological document. Lenin’s mausoleum is his alone at this time . The moral: everyone produces and is building socialism. It starts with slavery and ends with developing countries joining the socialist revolution.

So great is his fear, that he prefers to sleep with his mother  and have her accompany him to the bathroom at night. This creates major annoyance in the household, which is also populated by Raghava's brother , sister-in-law  and their children. One day, Raghava and his friends are forced to abandon their usual cricket ground and find a new one; they unwittingly select an abandoned ground which is rumored to be haunted. When they attempt to set up their game kit, a bizarre weather change scares them away. Raghava brings home his cricket stumps, which have been stained with blood from a buried corpse in the ground. Raghava forgets the incident and focuses on wooing Priya , the sister of his sister-in-law, who has come by on a visit. In the following days, his mother and sister-in-law are witness to several paranormal phenomena at night; prominently a ghostly apparition haunting the hallways.

Kanchana  is a transgender who was disowned by her parents due to her effeminate behaviour. She is offered shelter by a kind Muslim , who has a mentally retarded son. Regretting that she couldn't become a doctor as she intended, she adopts another young transgender, Geetha, and works hard to support her financially.

Although engaged, he falls in love with the singer, but has to leave next day for action in the Pacific, joining an experienced bomber crew as their new pilot. The crew is reluctant to accept their new ""skipper"" and decide to dump him at the out-of-bounds nightclub, coming back later to find the Captain and the torch singer kissing. In the Pacific, after realizing that a string of their bad luck has to be broken, Captain Ransom acquiesces to the crew painting the image of ""Bamboo Blonde"" on the nose of his bomber, as the crew members think that the striking blonde singer they had seen, is his girl. The ""Bamboo Blonde"" becomes famous when the B-29 sinks a Japanese battleship and shoots down numerous Japanese fighter aircraft. The armed forces decides to bring the ""Bamboo Blonde"" and its crew back home to sell war bonds across the country and Clark knows that he can exploit his singer's connection to the famous bomber. Back in New York, the Captain leaves his fiancée and seeks out Louise, who has also fallen in love with the pilot."

Attacked by dark elves, the Princess is saved by the warriors Lord Artemir and Cador Bain. The two warriors insist that they accompany Princess Alora on her quest to act as her guardians and warn her of the dragon which dwells within the forest. Princess Alora and the two warriors are ambushed by a trio of bandits  who identify themselves as the Kensington Vassals, famous for having slain a dragon. Princess Alora promises the three land and title in exchange for their knowledge and assistance, to which the Vassals agree despite tension between Gareth, Lord Artemir, and Cador. As the group's passage through the forest continues, they encounter an elf named Damara and her mistress Freyja, a mysterious necromancer. Freyja cryptically forewarns that not all of Alora's companions shall survive their trek, but one is destined to slay the dragon. Declaring that she shall render them aid, Freyja and Damara join the Princess as well. The necromancer easily takes measure of the group's character, noting the budding romance between Cador and Alora. The group is taken by surprise when the dragon attacks them, and their attempts to fight the beast do little to injure it. Sogomo is trapped under a tree felled by the dragon during the fray and, horrified, the party can do nothing but watch as the dragon devours him. Once the Princess and her band flee and regroup, Freyja takes Alora aside to divulge a new strategy for defeating the beast. The necromancer reveals that she was responsible for creating the dragon many years ago to fight the dark elves at the behest of Alora's father, the king. Unable to control the beast, however, Freyja did what little she could to confine it to the forest of Sidhe. Confiding that the dragon's death shall mean the necromancer too shall die, Freyja also gives Alora a wand made of a small tree branch to use against the dragon. The Princess bestows a knighthood upon Cador for his valor, grimly noting that there may not be another chance to do so. The group decides to seek the dragon in its lair, and prepare to attack the sleeping beast only to be ambushed themselves by a band of dark elves. Naga continues to fight despite being shot with several arrows until she succumbs to the fatal wounds. The Princess and her accompaniment of warriors fend off the elves in time to turn their attention to the awoken dragon. Lord Artemir attempts a valiant charge only to be consumed in a gout of flame, perishing. The wand given to Alora transforms into a spear, and the Princess pierces the dragon's heart. As the dragon dies, Freyja collapses and confides in her dying breath that Alora was her daughter. Reinforcements of dark elves arrive but concede victory and allegiance to the Princess as she brandishes the spear aloft in triumph. Though the dragon is defeated and the war with the dark elves is brought to an end, the group of adventurers gathers for the bittersweet funeral of their fallen comrades. The king dies during Princess Alora's return journey, but she ascends to rule the kingdom with Sir Cador at her side.

32312198	/m/0gyw77p	Keroro Gunso the Super Movie 4: Gekishin Dragon Warriors				{}	{}	"{""/m/0hcr"": ""Animation""}"	"{{plot}} The film opens with a theme song performed by The Brothers Four and a colorful animation of hot air balloons, with artwork reminiscent of the Montgolfier balloons. The theme song is later performed by Fabian twice during the film. The film then shows the flight of the balloon Jupiter invented by Professor Fergusson . In the unicorn-shaped gondola, the passengers Chiddingfold  and Sir Henry Vining  scream in horror as the balloon rapidly descends, but the Professor remains calm as he planned for this to happen. He then signals the pilot Jacques  to ascend the balloon, who explains how balloon is able to ascend and descend without the loss of gas or ballast. The balloon successfully lands and attracts a crowd, but Sir Henry and the other passenger are dissatisfied after the seemingly disastrous descent. Sir Henry, the president of the Royal Geographic Society, refuses to fund the Professor's plan to explore east Africa, while Chiddingfold leaves claiming he has an ""appointment"". The Professor seems out of financial backing for his plans, but an American journalist talks to Fergusson about having his nephew and star reporter Donald O'Shea  as part of Fergusson's plan to explore east Africa. When he arrives at the Prime Minister's office in Zanzibar, he is given the mission to use his craft to claim areas of uncharted west Africa for the Crown before slave traders make their claim to the territory. Fergusson agrees. The following day, Consul tells the bad news that the slave traders know of his plan and would reach the river Volta in six weeks, leaving him with five. To make matters worse, the Queen has sent Sir Henry Vining to accompany him. He wants to be referred to as General Vining and proclaims himself the ""expert on Africa."" Meanwhile in the marketplace, Jacques finds O'Shea rescuing a slave girl named Makia  and they bring her along, and they go to the Consul's office. Consul Townsend orders Makia to be returned to her owner, but she fights the slave trader and leaves on a horse. The people in the marketplace become outraged and threaten to destroy Jupiter. O'Shea begins to be viewed as a troublemaker and as the balloon takes off he is shocked to know that the plans of the journey have been changed. The balloon lands in a forest and they have dinner. As they converse at the table they notice their food is being taken away and find Makia hiding under the table. She says she hid up in the crow's nest of the balloon and will not leave O'Shea, who does not want her and offers her to the others on board. Disappointed she tries to leave into the dangerous wilderness only to be stopped and eventually agrees to be a passenger aboard. Meanwhile, a wild chimpanzee walks out of the forest and joins the crew. As the rest of the crew sleeps, Jacques and the chimp drink coffee. Makia comes out of the gondola unable to sleep in fear of the wilderness and suggests Jacques to buy her. Jacques explains how slavery is uncivilized and explains marriage. Lightning is heard and they take off the balloon. The following day, they land in the Arab city of Hezak. People run in fear, until a Muslim priest comes out and refers to O'Shea as the Moon God. The crew have dinner in the Sultan's palace, where a slave trader named Ahmed  comes in with a kidnapped American woman . Ahmed points at the moon emerging in the clouds, to which the Sultan  proclaims them as fakes. The crew escape quickly, but Ahmed climbs a ladder aboard. When they land they find out that Ahmed has stolen diamonds and medals from the Sultan. The American woman introduces herself as Susan Gale explains that she is a missionary. The professor explains they are headed for the Volta river to claim the land and stop slavery, but claims O'Shea doesn't care about the slave trade. He tries to explain that he is only a journalist but Susan interrupts saying ""trafficking human lives is everyone's concern, either you're for it or against it,"" to which Ahmed says ""I'm for it."" The balloon continues its progress and lands near a forest. Susan is still angry at Donald and still thinks he doesn't care about slavery but Makia explains how he saved her from slavers. Meanwhile, O'Shea goes out hunting with a gun provided by General Vyning. He walks into the forest and sees a lion, but when he tries to shoot it he realizes that the gun is unloaded. He then falls into a trap set by natives, who free him, but when he runs away they chase after him with spears. Quickly the crew takes the balloon off as a spear narrowly misses them inside the gondola. As they fly again, Donald and Susan build a relationship. After they land again, however, O'Shea accidentally hammers the anchor away, setting the balloon free. The anchor luckily catches the top of a tree, but everyone including Susan becomes disappointed at him. The Professor and General consider offering O'Shea to the slavers, as they tell how he was only aboard to carry testimony for Americans, but now they had a less troublesome Susan Gale. However, O'Shea wins back the crew's trust when he spots out a sandstorm. The balloon lands in an oasis and the crew relaxes. Ahmed, however, is ordered to work and thinks he is being treated as a slave, telling Jacques ""I'm not a slave, I sell them!"" A gunshot is heard and the Sheik's men on horseback come to arrest the Professor, Vyning, Makia and Susan, taking them to Timbuktu. Ahmed and Jacques stay the gondola while O'Shea, who was picking dates, and the chimp stay in the trees until the men leave. In Timbuktu, the arrested crew are set to die as infidels and Makia be sold as a slave under the order of the Sheik Ageiba. Disguised as Arabs, Jacques, Ahmed and Donald purchase Makia from a slave trader . Makia tells of the plan to kill the rest of the crew and they fly their balloon to the top of a tower to save them. After defeating many of the men, they take off, but a sword is thrown onto the balloon's envelope, causing a slow leak to occur. The Professor, now knowing the slavers have less than two days, feels certain defeat, but Donald suggests they fly over night. The following day, they reach the Volta river, but sword plugged on the envelope starts to rip away, causing the balloon to descend. Everything is thrown overboard to help the balloon gain some lift as they fly towards a bridge, but see the slavers. The head slaver shoots the balloon causing it to deflate as the crew climb into the crows' nest. The anchor is thrown onto the bridge and the gondola is released, causing the balloon to ascend and break the bridge, causing most of the slavers to drown. The head slaver, however, survives with their flag. The balloon's crew swim across the river, except for Ahmed, who remains seated on the balloon's drifting envelope because he can't swim. Donald goes back to retrieve the Union Jack as the envelope raft tumbles over the waterfall. Ahmed tells Donald to jump with the flag. He then kills the slave trader by throwing a dart into his chest, sending him falling into the water. The crew are finally proud that O'Shea had done something triumphant, but he falls into the water. Susan tries to save him and falls in the water and they kiss, while Jacques and Makia also kiss. General Vyning admits to Professor Fergusson that he was wrong about his balloon. The film ends with the chimpanzee finding a companion for itself."

When his son Rangachari  goes on a mission to research on Tughluq, he finds a buried coffin that contains Thugluq , and his accomplice Ibn Batuta alive inside. They claim that they are the true Thugluq and Batuta buried several centuries ago along with a herb that has protected them and kept them alive until 1968 A.D.  Thugluq becomes a national sensation and is welcomed in all grandeur to Rangachari's house. He is interviewed by many newspaper journalists to whom he answers in a very sarcastic attitude. He learns the changes of the past centuries in almost four days and mocks that the advancements are no more than four days' advancement. He decides to contest in elections to become the Prime Minister of India. In his good faith, Thanikachalam, an old freedom fighter, and his daughter Gandhimadhi ([[Manorama  volunteer to help taking part in his political rallies. In his political campaigns, Thughluq makes a mockery of all of the other politician contenstants  and in a satiric tone asking the people to vote for him. Thugluq eventually wins the elections and forms a cabinet of ministers announcing that anyone who joins his party will become the Deputy Prime Minister. A total of 450 people join his party and all of them are made Deputy Prime Ministers. At the news being announced at radio the masses become very happy. A few people  even go as far as wagering and jumping with joy. The Rangachari family also become very overwhelmed at it. Thugluq appoints the naive Gandhimadhi as one of his ministers. She initially does not understand the street-smart nature of the political world and shows an innocent face to the people she meets. Tughluq shows a self-opinionated attitude to the cabinet ministers and lends a deaf year to all their proposals. He instead makes foolish plans to tackle the country's problems that neither makes sense nor solve the problems in question. For example, to solve the problem of which language  should be the national language, he suggests a foreign language of Persian must be the language claiming that it is new to Indians and it will not be a partial decision for both parties. In an attempt to abolish bribery and corruption he legalizes them so that they do not become a problem. When there is a calamity for his decisions he makes a direct speech to the people through radio, to request peace and promises to look into the problem . Gandhimadhi slowly learns all the trickery of politics and gets indulged in bribery. She rises to a very pompous lifestyle as opposed to her previous poverty-ridden one. She is now able to take good care of a few children in her care and also celebrates her birthday in a lavish style. Venniradai Moorthy plays a cameo as a singer in her birthday party. Her father  gets bedridden and is dying. When Gandhimadhi comes down to meet him he hands her over a letter, and asks her to deliver it to Thugluq or Batuta on December 31 that year. He further says that herself or anyone else must not read this letter and must be given to Thugluq with utmost secrecy. She promises him on it. He eventually dies. Back in Delhi, Thugluq and Batuta have a small talk in solitude. In a twist ending, it is revealed that both are actually college students , who in an interest to reform the country have acted as Thugluq and Batuta. Both with the help of their guru Thanikachalam, took an oath before Goddess Kali that they would surrender themselves of their crime, on December 31 before the people. They hid themselves in a coffin on the site in Daulatabad, where Prof. Rangachari would take up his research, and start impersonating from there on. They believed that after this incident, the people would contemplate on this matter and cause a revolution that would change the state of affairs to come. However Mahadevan alias Thugluq suggests that they maintain the status quo and live a prosperous life for themselves. Mahadevan, corrupt through his exposure to politics now refuses to accept that he is Mahadevan and still calls himself Thugluq. However Raghavan  is now stubborn on revealing their true colours. Raghavan approaches Gandhimadhi to get the letter, her father gave her. The letter is a written confession of the details of the trio's plan signed by Mahadevan himself and posted to Thanikachalam. This letter is now the only evidence to reveal Thugluq's true colours. However, Gandhimadhi, now knowing the ways of the world, refuses to hand over the letter because, if she does even she will be in trouble for supporting both of them. She instead throws the letter into the hearth. Raghavan attempts to explain everything to the cabinet ministers and later to the masses, however, Thugluq states that his ""good friend"" Batuta has gone insane suddenly and asks everyone not to believe him. He further tricks the people, through his words, to kill Batuta, with whom dies their secret."

Both with the help of their guru Thanikachalam, took an oath before Goddess Kali that they would surrender themselves of their crime, on December 31 before the people. They hid themselves in a coffin on the site in Daulatabad, where Prof. Rangachari would take up his research, and start impersonating from there on. They believed that after this incident, the people would contemplate on this matter and cause a revolution that would change the state of affairs to come. However Mahadevan alias Thugluq suggests that they maintain the status quo and live a prosperous life for themselves. Mahadevan, corrupt through his exposure to politics now refuses to accept that he is Mahadevan and still calls himself Thugluq. However Raghavan  is now stubborn on revealing their true colours. Raghavan approaches Gandhimadhi to get the letter, her father gave her. The letter is a written confession of the details of the trio's plan signed by Mahadevan himself and posted to Thanikachalam. This letter is now the only evidence to reveal Thugluq's true colours. However, Gandhimadhi, now knowing the ways of the world, refuses to hand over the letter because, if she does even she will be in trouble for supporting both of them. She instead throws the letter into the hearth. Raghavan attempts to explain everything to the cabinet ministers and later to the masses, however, Thugluq states that his ""good friend"" Batuta has gone insane suddenly and asks everyone not to believe him. He further tricks the people, through his words, to kill Batuta, with whom dies their secret."

The apparatus permits direct visual and thought communication between one wearing the device and another wearing the same mechanism. The second wearer experiences exactly what the first one experiences. The U.S. Military believes this to be a positive development for air defense and has scheduled an official test of the unit. Christopher and his friend, Misty Somers ' attend as his pilot friend, ace air pilot Zach Taylor ', helps with the Government analysis.  Unbeknownst to Zach and government officials, a shadowy criminal organization led by a sinister figure known only as the Spider Woman ' plots to steal the invention and kidnap Christopher. To carry off her scheme, the villainess enlists the help of Major Thompson ' one of the Spider Woman’s operatives. Her chief henchman, Wade ' attempts to steal the device following the test. However Zach, returning from the airbase, foils the plot. Thompson quickly removes Christopher and Misty from the test area before others can learn of his duplicity. The Spider Woman instructs Thompson to change cars and provides instructions as to where the stolen device is to be transferred. Following the auto exchange from a limo to a convertible, the kids are shoved to the floorboard and covered with a tarp so they remain unseen. Under cover of the tarp, Christopher dons the helmet used in the testing so others can see and hear what he does. Thompson is unaware than that the boy genius’ invention is being monitored. Back at the trial site, the military test supervisor General John Arnold ', realizes that the children and invention are missing and issues an all points alert. Zach catches up with the Spider Women’s mob before they can escape. Wade engages Zach in hand-to-hand combat causing both to fall from the precipice of a tall building. Wade dies but Zach manages to grab a ledge before he plummets to the concrete. He nearly slips from the edge but is saved by General Arnold and Dr. Richard Evans . Dr. Folwell informs the others that Christopher’s telepathic device is working but is unworn. Zach suggests that Folwell continue to monitor the signals and wear the remaining helmet in the advent someone else should put it on. Zach and General Arnold take to the air in an attempt to find the car used in the kidnapping. At the same time, they maintain contact with Dr. Folwell in case Christopher can get through. Christopher and Misty plot to inform others of their location. The boy waits for the opportune moment and then suddenly stands as Misty throws off the tarp. Christopher quickly looks around hoping that the images he sees are being transmitted to others back at the military test site. They are and as soon as Dr. Folwell obtains their location, he transmits the data to Zach and General Arnold. Thompson realizes what the boy has done and smacks the child to the floorboard. In the meantime, Zach locates the escaping car and aerially pursues the vehicle. In a daring rescue effort, Zach makes several close passes at the car – virtually flying at car level. Thompson removes a heat laster from the car and fires repeated at the aircraft, nearly hitting it on several occasions. Christopher lurches upward and with Misty’s help, knocks the weapon from Thompson’s hands. Misty shoves herself forcibly into Thompson as Christopher leaps into the front seat of the car. As he settles into the seat, he spins and delivers a strong martial arts kick to the driver's head, sending him flying out of the car. Christopher quickly moves behind the steering wheel. General Arnold has taken control of the plane as Zach crawls to the outside. Zach sees Christopher remove the car's driver and immediately dives from the low flying plane. He lands atop Major Thompson in the back seat and as they struggle, the driverless car heads for a steep cliff. Christopher swiftly grabs the steering wheel and pulls hard in the other direction as he tries to apply the break. This sends the car into a wild spin, which barely misses the cliff but does pitch Thompson overboard. As the car comes to a stop, Zach leaps from the car onto Thompson, knocking him unconscious. The Spider Woman calls Thompson to get an update but her message is intercepted by Zach who promises that they will track her down. She knows she has lost and screams with rage as the scene dissolves to a press conference where Christopher Booke and Misty Sommers’ quick action is being recognized. One of the reporters asks about the identity of the Spider Woman. General Arnold affirms that authorities do not know but that her men are talking and authorities expect to take her into custody soon. Hidden in the reporters is the Spider Woman, disguised as one of them. She watches as Misty kisses Christopher on the cheek. The boy turns a bright red as the Spider Woman slips away into the dark recesses of an adjacent corridor. The villainess glares hostilely once more as the screen fades to black and the closing credits.

By then, an repaired Datas falls into the Amachi Institute and reveals a strange cloud formation is negating the memory-erasing Gosei Cards and is spreading before Master Head contacts the Gosei Angels to immediately return to the Gosei World. However, the Gosei Angels feel they need to track down the source, with Alata convincing the others to go public. After the Goseiger Emergency Press Conference, the Gosei Angels meet a man named {{nihongo}} as he offers to be their manager and make them household names. But overtime, as stardom runs them ragged and straying from their investigation, the Gosei Angels are tricked into breaking-and-entering the Prime Minister's estate. Luckily, Gosei Knight saves the gang as they about to be arrested and gets them back to the Amachi Institute. However, the damage is done and the Gosei Angels are demonized with Nozomu and his father the only ones who know they are framed. Then, while watching the news, the Gosei Angels realize that they were framed by someone in Sakai Entertainment. Demanding answers from Sakai, the Gosei Angels realize that Sakai Entertainment's staff and every other human are emitting a black mist, the darkness in their hearts, which is feeding the cloud bank which is tied to the Bibi Bugs. Furthermore, the Gosei Angels learn that the one responsible is Sakai's aide, {{nihongo}}. Finding Yumeko, she reveals that her dreams of becoming an actress were dashed and she allowed herself to become the host of King Bibi, the last of the Bibi Bugs that masterminded the Gosei Angels' downfall by negating their memory-erasing cards in order to avenge his race. Forming himself over Yumeko, King Bibi uses the human's body to force the Gosei Angels not to fight back as their defeat is televised. However, with Datas's help, Nozomu manages to pirate the broadcast to restore the peoples' faith in the Gosei Angels by reminding them of all the good they did. By then, as King Bibi's hold over the humans fades, Gosei Knight arrives as he and the Gosei Angels reach Yumeko, touching her heart. This completely disperses the dark clouds and weakened King Bibi enough for him to ejected from her. Without his human shield, King Bibi is defeated by the Goseigers and Gosei Knight using their Gosei Knight Dynamic combo. Using the remaining darkness he absorbed, King Bibi enlarges himself as Ground Gosei Great is formed to destroy him. After checking up on Yumeko, assuring her to keep following her dream to become an actress, the Gosei Angels use their memory-erasing Gosei Cards to remove everyone's memories. Soon after, the Gosei Angels bid Gosei Knight and Datas good bye as they go their separate ways again.

Becoming Gokai Silver to investigate in Gojyu Rex, Gai is shocked to find what seemed to be Gokaioh appearing from the ship and attacking him. Defeating Gojyujin, Fake Gokaioh jumps back to the ship as it immediately disappears. Later, aboard the Gokai Galleon, the crew identify the mysterious vessel as the space-wandering ghost ship said to carry a fabled treasure known as the God Eye - which can grant any wish to its holder. Seeing this as a better opportunity to obtain the Greatest Treasure in the Universe regardless of the risks, the Gokai Galleon crew embark on a voyage to find the ghost ship and acquire the God Eye. The Gokai Galleon locates the ghost ship and makes port in its skull figurehead's mouth. After encountering a trio of annoying ghosts who unknowingly pointed them in the right direction, the Gokai Galleon crew reach the ship's main bridge and see the God Eye resting on the left eye of a giant skull. However, they are stopped by the ship's captain Los Dark, who reveals that he was luring would-be thieves to his lair as he sends the crew into a dimensional underworld so his minions can kill them and allow him to live again. The crew wind up at a park, finding themselves surrounded by ghosts of previous Super Sentai enemy grunts. After the Gokaigers take down several of them, the remaining members from each grunt group merge to form the Combined Combatant. Though the stronger opponent, the Combined Combatant proves to be unstable due to internal conflicting among the grunts composing him over who gets to finish the pirates off. Taking advantage, the Gokaigers use the Battle Fever J Keys to destroy the Combined Combatant with the Penta Force Cannon, the explosion sending them to a baseball stadium, where they confront Baseball Mask of the Black Cross Army who challenges them to a game of baseball. Using the Gorenger Keys, execute the Gorenger Hurricane baseball to accept the Masked Monster's challenge. The Gokaigers score two strikes, and the third one being a distraction move using the G3 Princess trio. The resulting explosion from Baseball Mask's demise sends the Gokaigers into yet another dimension, where they are attacked by Agent Abrella and his Mechanoid army. Realizing they have no chance if they continue fighting the specters of old Sentai foes without an end in sight, the crew decides to be a distraction with the Dekaranger Keys while Captain Marvelous uses the Red Hawk Key to fly through the portal back into the ghost ship. Emerging, Gokai Red sees Los Dark closing the portal so his crew cannot escape before engaging the specter in a fight between captains. Using the epic battle against Los Dark to get it, Captain Marvelous grabs the God Eye and wishes for his crew's safe return as the item is revealed to be a fake before being shattered. Though defeated by the Gokaigers' Gokai Blast and Slash Final Wave, Los Dark summons Fake Gokaioh as the Gokaigers form Gokaioh to engage their opponent in battle from on the Ghost Ship's mast to the its deck. When Fake Gokaioh is about to fire its main cannon, the Gokaigers summon Variblune, Pat Striker, Magi Dragon, Geki Tiger and Dragon Headder to destroy Fake Gokaioh in an explosion that consumes the Ghost Ship. Back aboard the Gokai Galleon, the crew is having a hearty lunch while Gai arrives and is disappointed upon learning the God Eye was a fake as the pirates assure him that they will have more fun finding the Greatest Treasure without it.

She returns to her home in a rural district residing in Tokyo, Japan. Shortly after her return, her father, Shigeyuki , leaves for a business trip abroad in Singapore, leaving her with her 19-year-old younger brother Koichi . Haruka discovers one morning that her wheelchair has moved despite the wheels being locked. Believing it to be a burglary incident, Koichi begins setting up video cameras to catch the suspect. After discovering the wheelchair has moved again and all the windows had been locked, Koichi suspects it related to a paranormal force. Against Haruka's frightened pleas, he places a mound of salt in her room, which becomes scattered by morning. Koichi begins to investigate even further, to which Haruka disapproves of. After one of their drinking glasses break during dinner, Haruka reluctantly lets Koichi mount a video camera in her room. The camera records the demon entering Haruka's room and drawing her sheets. Koichi's friend Jun Nagoshi  visits the next day with his girlfriend Mai Yaguchi , who brings her friend Misuzu Kure  along as well. Misuzu remarks feeling a strange presence at the Yamanos' house, and curious, Koichi asks if she can investigate the demon haunting Haruka. After examining Haruka's room, Misuzu claims she has never felt a presence like the demon's before and suddenly plugs her ears, screaming. At night, Haruka wakes up to the spirit touching her, but Koichi finds nothing. Koichi and Haruka invite a Shinto priest over to their house to perform an exorcism . The priest believes the demon has settled down and assures the two that they have nothing to fear. The night progresses with no incidents, and by morning, Shigeyuki comes home from his business trip. On night 12, Haruka's wheelchair moves towards the camera and cuts it off. Haruka and Koichi review the footage and realize that the demon has not gone and is angry. Koichi phones Shigeyuki's office for help, but is told that he did not show up for work. The next night, the events worsen when Haruka is violently dragged out of bed by her hair via a force she reports to be under her bed. Koichi tries contacting the Shinto priest from the purification ceremony, but is told the priest died of a heart attack after leaving the ceremony. The two siblings debate on leaving the house and still receive no news from Shigeyuki when they call his cellular phone. Haruka tells Koichi to escape without her if the demon attacks them both. When night falls, Haruka recalls Katie, a woman involved in the same car accident that cut her trip short, and after searching her name on the Internet, believes that the demon that had possessed her is now targeting her. She reveals to Koichi that she experienced similar strange phenomena while recuperating in the hospital in America. Once Koichi leaves her room, he hears her screaming and finds her in the yard downstairs in her wheelchair. Haruka claims that the demon is tormenting her from behind and reveals a strange bite mark on her arm before losing consciousness. Koichi watches Haruka for the rest of the night and, in the morning, places a crucifix in her hand. After he leaves the room, Haruka drops the crucifix and it moves along the floor before combusting. Several windows break spontaneously in the room and Haruka does not awaken during any of this. On night 15, Haruka wakes up at 1 AM, walks to Koichi's room, and stares at him while he is asleep. Around 3 AM, she walks downstairs and wakes Koichi with a scream. Alarmed, Koichi runs to the living room, where he discovers Shigeyuki's corpse lying in one of the closets. A possessed Haruka appears and knocks away the camera in his hand. She violently throws Koichi at the camera in his room and slowly approaches him, but Koichi escapes and boards a taxi outside of his house. As the taxi drives away, Haruka suddenly appears in front of it, and the taxi collides into her before slamming into a wall. The crash kills the driver while Koichi survives the accident. Later, Koichi goes to a funeral home to pay respects to the dead taxi driver. However, he is suddenly dragged into the darkness screaming. After the camera cuts to black, the camera begins running again, and Haruka is seen slowly staring up at it. An epilogue text states that Koichi was found dead, Shigeyuki's body was discovered in the house later, and Haruka's whereabouts remain unknown.

Brannaman worked on the Robert Redford film The Horse Whisperer as the lead equine consultant. He teaches people to communicate with their horses through leadership and sensitivity, not punishment. The documentary follows Brannaman to several stops on his normal, 40-week-per-year circuit of ranches where he gives clinics on ""natural horsemanship"".

The stove is located in Mickey Mouse's hunting shack  which appears to have been unoccupied for a while. Soon Mickey and Pluto arrive for the hunting season. Pluto soon discovers that the stove is occupied by the chipmunks and helps Mickey build a fire to smoke them out. Chip and Dale realize what is happening and blow out Mickey's matches and roll of newspaper before they can catch the wood on fire. Finally Mickey is about to use a can of kerosene which the chipmunks can't blow out. From a hiding place underneath the stove, the chipmunks burn a hole in Mickey's boot with a match. Mickey assumes that Pluto is to blame and scolds him. Mickey remains unaware of the chipmunks throughout the film. After Mickey leaves to get more wood, Pluto chases Chip and Dale across the room. They lead Pluto across a table and mantle above the fireplace. Pluto accidentally gets his nose stuck in the muzzle of Mickey's rifle which is hanging over the fireplace. As Pluto tries to pull is nose free, he realizes that one of the hooks on which the rifle is mounted is directly in front of the trigger; the more Pluto pulls the more he will cause the gun to go off in his face. Gradually the table which Pluto is standing on with his hind paws starts to slide back. Pluto falls and makes the rifle fire, but rifle's delay is just long enough that Pluto narrowly avoids the bullet. Pluto lands on the floor where the rifle hits him on the head momentarily knocking him unconscious. From the table above Chip and Dale pour ketchup over the dog to make it look as if he is seriously wounded. Suddenly Mickey returns having heard the gunshot, and when he sees Pluto he thinks he is dead. Pluto comes to and first starts to comfort Mickey. But when he sees the ketchup he starts to panic. Mickey hurriedly carries him off to find help. Thus Chip and Dale regain working ownership over the property.This transfer of ownership is the reference of the film's title ""squatter's rights"" which is a form of adverse possession."

The hunchback accidentally drops the coffin in the mud causing muffled cursing to emanate from the coffin’s interior. Across town within a city’s dark streets a woman takes a shortcut through an alleyway. Suddenly, she hears footsteps behind her and quickens her pace, eventually breaking into a run. She stumbles, falling against wet garbage before colliding with a tall-cloaked figure. Nearby, two teenagers Reggie Helsley ' and Jessica Stuart ' hear the woman’s scream and rush to help. Upon arriving, they see nothing but as they leave, a lifeless arms drops unseen across a fallen garbage bin.  In the early morning hours, three children wait with parked bikes at the entrance to the old mansion. Doc ', Skeet ', and Curly ', are joined by two other children, Speck  and Angela '. The children discuss plans to sneak away from school during a planned fire drill, meet up again at the old house and spend the night. Each has convinced their parents they are staying overnight with a friend. A shadowed figure watches from the darkness of the upper windows as the children exit on their bikes. A car pulls into the driveway and Realtor, John Helsley ' steps from the vehicle to exchange his “For Sale” sign with one that says, “Sold”. A second vehicle arrives and a very agitated dark-haired man ' leaps out. Learning the house has sold, the man screams hysterically, causing the realtor to quickly toss his signs into the trunk and drive away. From the window, unseen hands close the drapes. The five young truants slip away from school during the fire drill while across town – the dark-haired man rushes into a police station demanding to be locked up. He claims that he will change into a werewolf with the evening’s full moon. The police ignore him whereupon he become violent and is locked in a cell. Meanwhile the children having entered the old mansion find themselves unexpectedly locked in and unable to escape. Soon they encounter the hunchback and Frankenstein's monster. With no way out, the children bravely separate to search for exits. Skeet accidentally falls through a hidden entrance into a cavernous-like room where he discovers a coffin adjacent to a stack of recently signed real estate documents. Skeet learns that Curly’s Dad was the realtor who sold the old house to a Count Vlad Drakulya. Abruptly the candlestick crashes to the floor and the coffin swings open. Count Vlad steps from the coffin motioning for Skeet to come forward. Vlad transforms into a large bat, causing Skeet to run hysterically through the dark halls.  The sounds of a howling wolf echo as the full moon rises over the city jail. The police chief and his assistant rush to the cellblock where the dark-haired man was incarcerated only to discover the prisoner’s cell door ripped from its hinges and their prisoner gone. Elsewhere in the old mansion, the other children escape the hunchback and rejoin Skeet who has escaped the flying bat. Skeet relates his misadventures and Doc, the most knowledgeable of the gang, informs them that Vlad is the real name for Dracula. The Frankenstein's monster discovers them causing them to flee. However, they abruptly run into the dark-haired man. The man tries to help the children escape, but is soon confronted by the hunchback. As they struggle, the man transforms into a werewolf who throws off the hunchback and begins stalking the children. Reggie discovers a note written by his little brother. In the note, Curly tells Doc of the plans to spend the night in the haunted mansion. Jessica, whose brother is missing as well, joins Reggie as they rush to the old manor in search of the missing children. The Frankenstein’s monster nearly captures Skeet and at the same time the hunchback discovers the others. All rush up an old staircase only to encounter Dracula blocking their passage. The vampire revolves to face the werewolf who rushes headlong toward him. Dracula raises his cape and transforms into a bat as the werewolf leaps over the stairwell snatching the bat from the air and crashing to the floor below. The monster reaches for Skeet and stumbles, falls, and bounces down the long winding stairway. As the children recoil, Curly’s and Jessica burst through large French doors leading from the outside into the large ballroom where the children are cornered. The Frankenstein's monster rushes Reggie but screams in pain at the sounds of gunfire. Curly’s dad – the realtor, John Helsley, stands at the entrance with a large hunting rifle. As the creature staggers, Helsley fires repeatedly. The monster crashes to the floor as the father spins and fires his weapon, dropping the clubfooted hunchback wildly swinging an axe at the children. Curly rushes into his father's arms, who explains that he was carrying the hunting rifle the brothers gave him for Father’s Day. A huge bat settles behind Helsley, transforming into Dracula. The vampire’s long arm sweeps the man and boy aside like feathers. The creature takes several quick steps and seizes Jessica. The twang of an archery bow reverberates as Dracula screams in anguish and twists around with a wooden arrow protruding from his back. The vampire collapses to the floor and crumbles into dust. Sirens signal arriving police whom the father had phoned on his way to the old manor. Helsley exits with his sons along with Doc and Speck. Skeet and Angela turn to leave when something springs at Skeet causing him to faint. Regaining consciousness Skeet is startled once more as a small black cat leaps onto his chest. Skeet’s eyes widen and he faints again. Angela nods her head and quips, “My hero!” A bat flies through the doorway toward an upper window as the picture fades to black for the final credits.

As the invading Japanese Imperial Army overruns China's capital city, desperate civilians seek refuge behind the nominally protective walls of a western cathedral. Here, John Miller , an American mortician on a task to bury the head father of the convent schoolgirls, joined by the group of innocent schoolgirls and fourteen flamboyant prostitutes. After an incident when Japanese forces assault the cathedral , Japanese Colonel Hasegawa  finally promises to protect the convent by placing guards in front of the gate, and requests that the girls sing a choral for him.

Using a single-person permit Mr. Meng was able to obtain, he drives out of the town.

Hartfield explains that the events about to be shown in the film is raw footage from the sixth and final episode filmed, edited only for time-restraint purposes. The footage shows the crew of Grave Encounters — composed of Lance himself, occult specialist Sasha Parker, technical expert Matt White, cameraman T. C. Gibson, and guest-starring psychic medium Houston Grey - preparing to investigate the abandoned Collingwood Psychiatric Hospital where unexplained phenomena has been reported for years. They receive a tour of Collingwood and its underground tunnels and also learn about Collingwood's history, including a physician named Arthur Friedkin, who performed unethical experiments and lobotomies on the hospital patients before being killed by escaped patients. The crew voluntarily lock themselves inside Collingwood for the night and begin their investigation, setting up camp near the hospital's main entrance. Lance and his crew try to establish contact with the unseen entities responsible, and are tormented by hauntings, which become increasingly hostile. With half an hour left before the hospital caretaker comes to unlock the front doors, the crew starts packing. Matt goes to retrieve the cameras, but disappears. The others spend the next several hours looking for Matt, with the caretaker not arriving. They knock down the front doors to escape, only to discover it leads to another corridor, as do several other ""exit"" doors they find. They notice that it is still night outside when it should be daylight. After searching for more exits and trying to escape to the roof, they find out that the stairwell to the roof has a solid wall in front of it. Soon after, the camera turns to Sasha's back, which now has a disturbing message carved into it saying ""hello."" The crew continues searching for both Matt and an exit when they encounter a girl whose face contorts demonically. The crew flees in fear, but Houston is separated from the others and later violently assaulted by an unseen force, killing him. While resting, the others find hospital tags bearing their names on their wrists. They eventually find Matt, who is wearing a hospital gown and has been driven insane, mumbling nonsense about his apparent psychological disorder, and explaining that the only way for them to escape is for them to ""get better"" at the hands of the hospital's unseen residents. The crew continues to be chased through the hospital by several apparitions. T. C. is pulled into a bathtub filled with blood by a ghost and disappears, while Matt falls down an elevator shaft to his death as Lance and Sasha are attacked by a tongueless demon. Lance and Sasha enter the tunnels in search of another exit where Sasha, who has become violently ill, disappears in a mist that appears while she and Lance sleep. Terrified and insane, Lance continues through the tunnels alone, surviving by killing and eating rats, until he finds a door leading to Friedkin's operating room that contains an altar and pentagram for a demonic ritual, showing that Friedkin had used black magic for medical practice. He turns to see the apparitions of Friedkin and several nurses, who drag a screaming Lance onto their operating table. The camera blanks out for a moment before showing a lobotomized Lance, who says he is now ""better"" and allowed to go home, and gives a few parting words to the audience before the screen cuts to blue."

It also includes location footage from the redwood forests of Northern California (where the Endor scenes were filmed, Buttercup Valley in the Yuma Desert in Arizona, where the sequence aboard Jabba's sailbarge was shot, and various scenes on the soundstages at Elstree Studios near London where the interiors of Jabba's palace were filmed. Over 60 alien creatures were created for Return of the Jedi which were operated by a variety of techniques old and new. Footage from earlier films illustrated the various methods used, including using actors in costumes , stop motion miniatures (as seen in The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms and [[King Kong , and large scale mechanicals . Some of the creatures  were mainly puppeteered but also contained animatronic devices that could be controlled remotely. The documentary also includes scenes from more recent ""creature"" films from the era such as E.T., The Dark Crystal , and Dragonslayer .

This knowledge sparks a reverie and the film flashes back to Berlin, New Year's Eve 1931. Broke and frustrated with his writing, Christopher plans to spend the night in but his would be gigolo friend Fritz insists they go to a night club to see Fritz's new inamorata, Sally Bowles, perform. Fritz hopes to live off Sally's earnings as a film star but his ardor quickly cools at the sight of her fiancé Pierre, with whom she plans to leave for Paris that night. Instead, Pierre absconds with her money. Chris, taking pity on her, invites her to stay at his boarding house. They arrange for Chris to move to a smaller room and for Sally to take his old room. Over the course of a long and unproductive winter in which Chris cannot write and Sally finds no work, Chris attempts to initiate a sexual relationship with Sally. She rejects him, saying it would spoil their friendship. Their spirits renewed by the Spring, Christopher and Sally splurge on a Champagne Cocktail at a café and Sally quickly orders far more cocktails and caviar than they can afford. They are extricated from the situation by wealthy American socialite Clive Mortimer, who pays their check and takes them on a tour of Berlin night spots. Thus begins a whirlwind relationship between the three culminating in a planned trip to Honolulu. The trip never happens, as Clive wires that his plans have changed. Chris and Sally have a terrible fight, resulting in a rift in their friendship and Sally's planned departure. Feeling as though he has reconnected with real life, the formerly apolitical Christopher starts a street altercation with a group of Nazis. Returning home he discovers that Sally has not left because she is pregnant. Christopher proposes marriage but Sally refuses him. Writing up an account of his Nazi altercation, Chris sells his ""Portrait of Berlin"" to an American magazine to raise money for Sally to have an abortion. The magazine editor hires Chris to write a series of Portraits of European cities, expecting him to leave the following day. When he returns home Sally has changed her mind; she plans to keep the baby and marry Chris. The next morning, Sally tells Chris that she has mis-figured the dates and was never actually pregnant. She is also leaving Berlin for Paris, in pursuit of a film executive with whom Clive has connected her. Back in present-day London, Christopher and Sally reunite. Upon learning that Sally is again penniless and homeless, Chris invites her to stay in his spare room. In a subplot, Fritz tries to secure the affections of Natalia Landauer, a wealthy Jewish department store heiress and Christopher's student for English. When Natalia fails to respond to his charms, Sally suggest that he ""pounce"", make a sexual advance. He reports that this tactic is unsuccessful and Natalia refuses to see him. Fritz confesses to Christopher that he is Jewish and has been concealing it for years, but vows to stop lying about his heritage. Their story concludes with their announcement to Chris and Sally that they plan to marry and emigrate to Switzerland."

It later transpires that Tadgh killed the donkey after discovering it had broken into their field. The donkeys owner blames Bull McCabe for the death and demand ""blood money"". McCabe has a deep attachment to a rented field his family have cultivated from barren, to a very productive piece of land over a number of generations. The fields owner is a widow who, around the time of the 10th anniversary of the death of her husband, decides to sell the field. McCabe has been trying to buy the field from her for some time. She decides to sell the field by public auction rather than to McCabe directly. Unknown to McCabe his son, Tadgh, has been harassing the widow nightly for years. The widow believes McCabe is behind the harassment in order to force her into a sale. On hearing there will be an auction McCabe goes to the village pub and announces that nobody would dare bid against him for ""my field"". An American, Peter, whose ancestors are from the area, arrives in the village. He has plans to build a hydro-electric plant in the area and quarry stone for new ""highways"". Central to his plans is McCabe's field. At the auction Peter repeatedly out-bids McCabe, forcing the price up to 100 pounds, twice what McCabe can afford. Seeing the bidding war the widow stops the auction and insists there would be a new auction, with a reserve price of 100 pounds. Knowing he cannot out bid Peter and seeing his cattle thrown off the field, McCabe goes to the rectory to confront Peter, and the parish priest who has been supporting him. McCabe now discovers Tadgh's actions, expelling him from the meeting, and goes on to explain his deep attachment to the field. This includes the death of his mother while saving hay. Despite McCabe, Peter refuses to back down. In a desperate last attempt McCabe and Tadgh confront Peter at a waterfall he has just purchased, the night before the second auction. When Tadgh fails to defeat Peter in a fight, McCabe himself intervenes and beats both men in a rage. Peter is killed, and upon realising McCabe has a mental break. He confuses Peter with is dead son Seamie. Tadgh flees to the Travellers daughter he has fallen for. He tells her he has killed Peter. They plan to run off together. The Bird bids on behalf of McCabe and secures the field for 101 pounds at the second auction, unopposed. A Traveller boy spots the dead donkey floating in the lake and a crane is brought in to recover it. It inadvertently recovers the corpse of Peter. At the same time Tadgh comes home to tell his father he is leaving with the Travellers daughter and says he never wanted the field. The Parish priest arrives to confront McCabe about the discovery of Peter. Having lost his son and with the corpse discovered, McCabe insanely herds his cattle to the cliffs. The Bird follows Tadgh and tells him his father has gone mad. Tadgh rushes to stop his father but gets driven over the cliff by the heard of cattle and is killed. The film ends with McCabe attempting to drive back the waves from his dead son, and Tadgh's mother and the Travellers daughter sobbing on the cliff top. McCabe has constant doubts about the ability of Tadgh to safeguard the field. His older son, Seamie, committed suicide when he was 13. Toward the end of the film we discover McCabe blames himself for the death as McCabe told Seamie the field could only support one family, and Tadgh would have to emigrate when he grew up. Since the death McCabe and his wife have not spoken for 18 years. McCabe also revealed he inherited the field as he was the eldest son, and his siblings had no choice but to emigrate."

The crew and the scientist escape. The lead kidnapper finds a camera and realizes that the scientist stole the egg, which caused the snake to attack, and he decides to kill the snake, and the crew. The snake follows the crew, who are in a truck, but is wounded by a grenade. The second Piranhaconda arrives and, sensing blood, attacks its wounded mate. It then decides to track down the crew. The scientist reveals that he had the egg, so they try to escape via boat. But the Piranhaconda stalls their plans. The scientist pretends to get rid of the egg, but doesn't, causing the creature to follow them. The crew become trapped by the kidnappers, but the Piranhaconda crashes the party. It eats the ransomers and the star of the movie. The scientist and the two remaining crew members get back to the boat, but the man stays on shore to destroy the snake. In the water, the girl real-izes that the scientist had the egg all along. She throws it in the river and shoves him overboard. He is then killed by the Piranhaconda. The girl goes back to shore and finds the boy. They lure the Piranhaconda to a waterfall using the egg. Jack slips a bomb into the case and threw it at the beast, then he and the girl jumped into the river below. The bomb went off and decapitated the snake. The two then decide to go on a date. They kiss as a third Piranhaconda devours them both. The camera swithches to a shot of the waterfall, and the growl of the Piranhaconda is heard.

He discovers that his commanders intend to demolish the ruins of a local church, in which civilians were murdered by the German occupation forces at 1944. A local journalist who researches the event discovers that West German General Rucker ordered the massacre, but he is mysteriously murdered. Klaus defies his commanding officer Siebert, who instructs him to steal the documents indicting Rucker, and hands the evidence over to Jeanne.

Emboldened by his discovery of God in a pervasively polytheistic land, he returns to Ur Kaśdim where he assumes a janitorial position at his father's idol shop. One day, Utz visits the shop to buy an idol. Abraham innocently asks Utz to explain how an inanimate idol of stone can provide for and he urges Utz to disavow idolatry. Then, after destroying all the idols in the shop, Avraham places the mallet into the hand of a stone likeliness of Nimrod, the largest idol in the shop and attempts to mollify his father Terakh, insisting that the idol of Nimrod was the perpetrator of the iconoclasm. Enraged by the carnage of his idols, Terakh permits Nimrod's men to frogmarch his son to Nimrod to be condemned for his blasphemous and treasonable actions. Abraham breaks loose of the guard's grip en route the palace, and finds himself on the run once again. After a fortuitous encounter with an angel, who saves him from certain death in the desert, Abraham is led by the angel to the yeshiva of Noah. Noah takes Abraham under his wing and eventually instructs a now-matured and grown up Abraham to return to Ur Kaśdim and smash the pyramid of Mesopotamian idolatry. The final scene of the film is a showdown in which Abraham defiantly refuses to acknowledge Nimrod's bald self-declaration as ""God Supreme"" of the world. An infuriated Nimrod hurls Abraham into a bonfire, but he miraculously survives before the eyes of a repentant Nimrod, who now recognizes the God of Abraham and instructs his people to convert to Abraham's monotheistic beliefs."

During the game, the referee, Maurice Bruno , awards a penalty, resulting in the jaunes et noirs losing the match, and leading to fighting between the two sets of supporters. With the defeated and angry fans waiting for Maurice after the game, the team physio manages to quietly slip he and Martine out of the stadium in a van. The couple go to the local studios of FR3  where Maurice takes part in a football discussion programme. Rico and his gang go to a pizza restaurant, where they see Maurice on the television. Hearing what Maurice is saying, they becoming increasingly agitated, shouting insults at his image on the television. Angrily, they set off to the TV studio to find him. Maurice and his girlfriend manage to flee to a shopping centre. The gang follow them into the centre then spread out to search, using an alarm signal to keep in touch. During the search Rico accidentally kills Béru, a fellow gang member. The other gang members don't witness this so Rico blames it on Maurice. Determined to avenge their friend, Rico and the gang comb the stadium entrance for any trace of the referee. This leads them to Martine's home address. When they arrive at Martine's home, she and Maurice are inside. The gang cut the power and set about trying to gain entrance using any means possible, with Rico attacking the door with a blowtorch.

The car falls a few metres to the ground, apparently killing its two occupants. Granowski arrives at the scene moments later in his car. With mission accomplished, Rico walks away from camera, gleefully ranting, raving, gesturing, and proffering insults to the excavation workers around him. A police car is seen catching up with him just as the film ends.

In nearby Tibet and Ladakh, in Sikkim, Bhutan, and Nepal, traditional Tibetan Buddhist culture is either dead already or dying. The horror of Chinese government design in Tibet is being matched by the destruction of global economics elsewhere. Zanskar, ringed by high Himalayan mountains in northwest India, one of the most remote places on the planet, has been safe until now. But that’s changing. In 3-5 years a road connecting Padum, the heart of Zanskar, with Leh, the heart of neighboring Ladakh, will be finished. The route which previously took up to two days by car will take only 4-5 hours. As economic growth descends on Zanskar it will bring with it an end to this unbroken Buddhist social tradition. Will the native language, culture, and religious practice be able to survive? The Dalai Lama has instructed two monks from Zanskar’s Stongde Monastery to do everything in their power to insure that it does. The monks are building a school to educate the children from surrounding villages in their own language, culture, history, and religion. Presently, the government school teaches none of those subjects, and is closed most of the year. The nearby private school also doesn’t teach those subjects and is additionally unaffordable for the area’s poor families. At Stongde, along with indigenous traditions, the children will be educated in the best Western curricula. The monks are racing against the clock. While they complete the school they are also placing local children in other schools and monasteries in the city of Manali and beyond. This requires walking over a 17,500 foot pass. On foot. On horseback. Led by yaks... Whatever it takes.

Their destination is James's favourite beach at Barafundle Bay, on the Pembrokeshire coast. Davy is a kind, loyal and responsible soul who has been unemployed and helping James's family take care of him for quite a while already. Bill is boisterous and fun-loving, and everybody hopes he is finally getting around to breaking up with his long-time oppressive girlfriend. Miles, lately absent from James's life, is a handsome intellectual turned into a businessman and the son of a successful novelist who died, also of cancer, when Miles was a child. James's and Miles's friendship used to be very close and has always bordered on rivalry, particularly as aspiring writers. James is too weak to walk much any more, so he mostly sits in a special cart and needs a lot of very practical and physical help from his companions, in addition to liquid morphine and other medications at increasing frequency to manage his chronic pain and other symptoms. Having been ill for some years already, he seems to be at peace with his rapidly approaching death and takes childlike delight in everything this last journey has to offer. However, his failing strength and increasing discomfort and outright pain also bring out his bitterness in the knowledge that his life will be over before he ever had time to make anything much of it. Traveling over the rugged and isolated coastal terrain, the young men fool around having light-hearted, juvenile fun to give James the time of his life. They also encounter various odd persons and situations and are faced with a series of setbacks and accidents, including loss of various supplies and finally the cart. Everyone's nerves and patience are sorely tested by James's outbursts at each of his friends in turn: out partly of premeditation and partly of spontaneous anger due to pain, he seems to attempt to shake them out of mediocrity, settling for things and excessive unselfishness and into making what they actually want out of the lives they still have ahead. Davy is mortified by James's observations; Bill reveals that his girlfriend is pregnant and while he knows that they are not right for each other, under the circumstances he can't and won't leave her; Miles counters James's attacks with equally brutal honesty regarding James himself. Eventually James and Miles come to reveal the guilty secrets each has kept from the other. James found, copied and read the novel manuscript Miles finished years ago without ever telling anyone, and has been jealous ever since but also impressed by Miles's writing talent. Miles has kept away from James lately because he has been unable and unwilling to cope with his best friend's illness, but he is in love and sleeping with James's married sister, and she and her children will soon come to live with Miles – something he did not intend James ever to know. On the night they finally arrive at Barafundle Bay, James reveals the true purpose of the trip: he plans to drown himself in the sea while he still feels alive and before pain takes his life over completely. He asks his friends to allow him to do this and tell everybody that they woke up in the morning and found his body in the water. Horrified at the thought, they refuse; however, after temporarily losing James's morphine supply and witnessing him struggle with severe pain, they change their minds. Next morning, James swims out with his friends keeping him company, and eventually Miles helps him to drown himself near the shore and brings his body back.

With Carlita's party plans ruined, Amber and Lisa plan a party at Lisa's house the same night since her parents are away at a spa treatment. During the party, Amber gets Lisa up on stage to sing ""Typical"" which attracts the attention of Nick. Lisa and Nick talk after her performance and the two end up sharing an unexpected kiss and Nick then tells her he will break it off with Carlita. Amber and Lisa soon find out from Vice-Principal Richardson that Lisa's friend, Raj Kurkuri, who was trying to buy a used calculator online, accidentally forgot to log off on a school computer before Lisa send the changed party date message, and Raj is held responsible for the damages at Carlita's house. Lisa ends up passing on her friends' plans for finishing a claymation pig film now that she is popular. Meanwhile, Amber's sister Clementine feels her mother is too busy mourning the death of Amber to pay any attention to her. Seeing this for herself, Amber helps guide her mother into paying more attention to Clementine now that she has died. Lisa's friend Selena learns about Amber's involvement with Lisa's popularity and decides to use black magic to tell Amber to leave Lisa alone, but Amber tells her she needs to right what she did wrong in order to get into Heaven. Selena is understanding but still pleads for Amber to help Lisa return to normal. Amber confronts Lisa and, realizing that she has unintentionally ruined her life by making her popular, jumps into her body to drive her out to Oak Springs on Highway 7  so she would not make it back to town in time for the prom that evening. After stumbling onto Floyd's Gator Jerky Shop, and calls all her friends on a pay phone, Lisa is unsuccessful in getting a ride back into town until she reaches Selena. When Selena  make it to pick her up, Lisa learns being popular isn't what it is cracked up to be. She also learns Raj was suspended and has to perform community service to fix Carlita's yard. Meanwhile, Amber reports her failure to Supervisor J-3 and takes a ride down to Hell in a flaming prison shuttle bus. After just making it to prom night, Lisa confesses to her vice principal and the rest of the school that it was her that sent the mass email about the change to Carlita's party, not Raj. She then makes a speech on stage that everyone should break down the barriers between the popular and unpopular by voting Raj as Prom King which almost all of the students agree upon. After Raj is elected Prom King, Amber is transported off the shuttle bus to Hell to get her wings to enter Heaven as the least popular student was voted Prom King. She appears to Lisa one last time and the two share a hug with Amber promising to watch over Lisa from Heaven before she goes. Carlita  tries to stop the music by pulling wires from the stage's control box electrocuting herself in the process. Then Supervisor J-3's voice can be heard saying ""Here we go again."""

Guns start blazing and some crooks are killed and some escape. A bomb goes off when the Feds are looking over a yacht. In Black Point, Washington , John Hawkins is getting drunk in a bar. Still drinking from a bottle, he drives home, playing chicken with a truck which narrowly avoids him and then runs into a tree. This leads to the sheriff  and her chief deputy  turning up at his log cabin with guns drawn in case of trouble though Lisa is an old friend of John’s. However this is next day and John has now sobered up. Lisa tells him he has two strikes against him and the next time he causes trouble he’ll be put away . This leads to a contrite John jogging into town to the local docks where he passes a young couple who are moving into a riverside house they have rented. He meets his friend Standing Bear who runs a fishing boat  who John has let down again in not turning up for work because of his binges. John is set to work and later delivers some fish in his banged up vehicle to the new couple. The husband  is out and the wife  is having trouble with a water leak, which John fixes. As they are beginning to get friendly, Gus and some friends turn up so John leaves. He chucks away his booze stash when he gets home. Early next morning, he joins a hunting party with Standing Bear and some of his  Indian friends. Malcolm rings Gus up. He’s the man behind the villains and is a nasty person. Gus tells him that the Feds just got some “dirty money” but he still has the clean money.. The gang leave in a motor launch. John is jogging again and rescues Natalie who has jumped into the water to drown herself. Taking her back to her place, he sees bruises on her body where Gus has beat her up. Gus meanwhile kills his gang leader and gets the money back. John returns to his house late to meet Natalie there. They cook and eat a meal and talk about her husband Gus and things get more romantic and they end up in bed. Later she wanders into a nearby shack where John is sitting. All around are photos of a young girl. John reveals that it is his daughter Gabrielle, who was six when someone took her while out Christmas shopping two years ago. His wife later left him. After everyone else gave up on her, he is still looking for her. Natalie talks of them leaving together. Later, Natalie phones John that Gus and his cronies have turned up while she is packing. He rushes to her house and finds one of Gus’s men shoving her about. He attacks him and the other men and while one is accidentally shot by his friend, she shoots the other with a gun she stole from John the night they slept together. She then knocks John out and tapes his hands together, planning to kill him in the woods. John manages to escape and she thinks he fell over a cliff. Back at her house she then injures herself and makes it look like John is the guilty party before phoning the sheriff. The law turns up, then Gus turns up and it turns out that over $20,000 of jewelry is missing. Natalie who is in a local clinic tells Gus that “the bag” which Eddie  carried is gone. It had all the clean money in it. Natalie tells Lisa some lies, meanwhile Fred finds the gun belongs to Hawkins so she and he head to his cabin with other armed officers. Gus is informed that Hawkins is one of the men who took the money. Gus and his cronies go to the café and give Standing Bear a good beating to get information about John. John  finds the beaten up friend and takes him to the clinic and is arrested when he leaves. Gus and Natalie are taken for a ride to see Malcolm who is busy torturing three men , one of whom he knows tipped the Feds off about the “harbour drop” at the film’s start. Malcolm wants his three and a half million dollars of clean money back, or else. Gus hears that Hawkins has been arrested, which naturally shocks Natalie. John is saying nothing, and in return Natalie says he was not one of the people who robbed her. Lisa knows that she does not have the whole story as people are lying to her but with no other choice, she lets John go. He goes to see Bear who is recovering in the clinic and on leaving is met by two of Gus’s men who want to take him to meet Gus. He slaps them about some and before leaving tells them to tell Gus he’ll be at Flanagan’s  at two o’clock. At Flanagan’s he tells Gus he wants Natalie in exchange for the money, and that he’ll take him to the money. If anything happens to him though, a “fuck you” letter goes to the sheriff in an hour’s time. Gus stays with the car while two men follow him into the woods. He is having doubts over Natalie. In the woods, one of the men reaching for what he thinks is money puts his hand in a bear trap. John knocks the other out. Natalie now blames Malcolm, saying he set Gus up so he gets Natalie and the money. Gus sends Logan into the woods to kill John and heads off to Harbour Manor Inn to confront Malcolm. Logan fares badly and ends up in the hands of John, Bear and some Indian buddies. Malcolm’s tough guy image cuts no ice with Gus now and he shoots him and his two enforcers. Natalie escapes by car as Gus finds out too late that she is “playing him”. John visits the Sea Vista Camp Grounds, closed for the winter and finds the bag of money there, then goes to the Inn where he finds the dead bodies and alerts Lisa by phone. Gus is tipped off by Fred who is paying him for tip offs about Gus, and Lisa finds the money gone. She goes to John’s cabin where Gus gets her and he is waiting when John arrives with the bag of money. But while Gus has a gun on him, John threatens to drop a lit lighter into the bag of money which is now soaked in petrol. He does and dives out of the window, taking a bullet as he did so. Gus shows him Natalie who is ready to be hung, then he kicks the chair out from under her. The wounded John tackles him and they smash into a post which knocks down the cross beam Natalie is hung from. The wounded John is losing the fight against Gus when Natalie who has got free of the noose stabs him in the back, killing him. Lisa and Fred turn up, and Natalie decides to tell all. She goes to prison but John  is going to wait for her. He decides to leave the area for a job interview in San Francisco. End.

Her parents are divorced and she has minimal contact with her alcoholic father. Sarah lives with her mother, JoAnne, and stepfather, Matt. They do not notice how lonely Sarah is. She feels overshadowed by her sister, Nancy, and wishes to live with her father. Sarah commences drinking alcohol at a party hosted by her mother and stepfather. She feels uncomfortable with standard questions the guests ask her about how she is doing at school and what her favorite subjects are. Sarah is overcome with anxiety when she is forced to engage in conversations with important people at the party. She feels out of place in several situations. For example, her desire to fit in at school manifests itself with her attempting to become a member of the Glee Club. Unfortunately, Sarah is not accepted. Over the course of the film, Sarah makes numerous attempts to have contact with her salesman father, Richard , who often ignores his daughter's sincere attempts to have a meaningful father-daughter relationship with him. When Richard makes the effort to see her, he presents himself as someone who is interested in Sarah's life and wants to please his daughter. They often have fun together. When they meet, Sarah is disappointed to discover that her father is unemployed. He responds by asking Sarah to get him a beer. Her mood, however, improves when her father tells her that he threw his sample case from a bridge; this is a source of amusement for her. Richard shows that he is capable of showing affection for his daughter. Sarah is even more pleased when Richard gives her money in order to purchase an outfit. At first, when Sarah drinks, the alcohol seems to suppress her feelings of anxiety, insignificance and inadequacy. She associates happiness with drinking. For example, Sarah is embarrassed and humiliated when her mother arranges for her to attend a party at the Peterson's with a date, Ken. When Sarah emphatically states that she does not want to go, her mother's primary concern is of the social repurcussions if Sarah does not attend the party. Thus, at the party, Sarah plies herself with alcohol in order to satiate her feelings of inferiority. She surprises herself and others when she plays the guitar, which everyone at the party appreciates. When Sarah becomes inebriated at the party, her parents attribute blame to Ken, even though it was Sarah who made the conscious decision to drink copious amounts of alcoholic beverages. JoAnne is more concerned with the impression that the guests formed at the party of Sarah as opposed to caring about the welfare of her daughter. Ken exhibits an interest in Sarah. For example, he introduces her to his horse, Daisy. He invites her to spend a day with him and the two teenagers bond while riding Daisy. As a result of Sarah's close relationship with Ken, Sarah becomes more popular at school. While life at school improves for Sarah, her home life continues to be complicated, confusing amd erratic. For example, her mother decides to fire Margaret, the housekeeper, whom she has accused of watering down the scotch. Sarah knows that she herself is to blame and attempts to stand up for Maragaret. By this point in time, Sarah has began to appropriate the alcohol which is delivered to the house. Although Sarah exhibits symptoms of shame as a result of her drinking, she begins to consume alcohol at school. Matters become even more complex for Sarah when the school counsellor speaks to JoAnne and Sarah about the fact that Sarah has not attended classes. JoAnne also realises that Sarah has forged notes in JoAnne's name excusing her daughter from her classes. The counsellor is adamant that something is wrong in Sarah's life. JoAnne takes offence to this statement. The counsellor characterises Sarah as a student with a high I.Q. who once took a diligent approach to her schoolwork. JoAnne resents the counsellor's interventions and feels that she is being targeted because Sarah's parents are divorced. When Ken confronts Sarah about her binge drinking, she confesses that she drinks because the alcohol makes life a little bit easier. As the film progresses, Sarah endeavours to be regarded as mature. Her Daffy Duck hat, however, belies her attempts. She dons the hat when she babysits for the Tylers. When she does so, Ken  gently rebuffs her when she tells him that she loves him. To make matters worse, Sarah is unable to contact with her father when she attempts to do so by telephone. Sarah drinks when she is supposed to be babysitting and then passes out. When her mother discovers what Sarah has been up to, her only concern is that Sarah will be the focus of neighbourhood gossip. In a confrontation with Matt and JoAnne, Sarah states that she has been drinking almost everyday for two years. As she drinks more, however, things begin to get out of control. When Sarah and her mother see a doctor, her mother proves her inadequacy as a parent because she refuses to believe that Sarah has a problem and is only concerned what other people will think. Despite her mother's criticism, Sarah attends an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting where she meets Bobby, who is even younger than Sarah. What Bobby tells the group resonates with Sarah. She recognises herself in what Bobby says, such as the lying to other people as well as to oneself. During her family therapy sessions, Sarah expresses a desire for her family to be complete once again and for her parents to stop fighting. When Matt reveals that he is unable to have full custody of Sarah because of the nature of his job, Sarah once again feels the irresistible urge to drink. She is unable to purchase liquor because of her young age. She then asks a group of rough-looking teenagers to purchase a fifth of vodka for her. Sarah attempts to seal the bargain by inviting the youths to do anything that they would like to Sarah. They oblige, but tease her by devouring most of the bottle themselves. After she devours a bottle of vodka, she decides to take Daisy for a ride. Sarah's actions have fatal consequences for Daisy. Sarah spends time in a hospital, where she expresses extreme remorse for the way she has acted. She does not understand why she has been placed in a world where the only feelings she possesses are rotten and dismay. Sarah realises how much she has loved when not only her Mother and Father are willing to assist, but also her friends whom she has met when she attended the Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.

Following her marriage to Aeneas Gunn who has just bought a 1 million acre cattle station near Mataranka, called Elsey Station, Jeannie follows him from Melbourne in 1902. Some of the drovers were unhappy at first because they believed that the bush is no place for a white woman. As such, they were both wary of her and made fun of her when both her and her husband arrived. However, Jeannie was determined to prove them wrong. While her husband was away with the other men herding the cattle, Jeannie begins making friends with the Aboriginal people. Her husband and the other white men treated the local people  as inferior to them, often regarding them as lazy, indifferent, and unreliable. Jeannie however is sympathetic, often giving them food, or trying to stop domestic disputes. Later, Aeneas goes on a cattle muster, and asks Jeannie to come along, which she does gladly. However the trip is difficult for her, riding side-saddle, and she is nearly attacked by a rogue bull. However, as time passes, things improve at the station - the house is expanded, a new Chinese cook arrives, a garden is planted, and her belongings finally arrive from Melbourne. But boredom sets in as she assumes her place - that of the station master's wife. She is asked not to help a feverish yet dying man, or to interfere with the balance of things, or to give the Aboriginal people goods meant for the working men. As a result, she spends more time with the locals, since she longs to learn and understand more about their ways. Jeannie even takes a semi-orphaned mixed-heritage child called Bett-Bett under her wing, much to the dismay of her husband. Over time Jeannie gains the respect of the Aboriginal people and they slowly open up to her. At one point, Goggle Eye, an elder Aboriginal male, allows her to watch an Aboriginal dance. The stockmen however interrupt the ""heathen"" dance, shooting and shouting ""God save King George"". Later, Bett-Bett goes on walkabout, and Goggle Eye becomes ill and feverish, believing that he has been affected by a singing curse, and passes away.

Next day, Inder meets Suman and asks her the reason for not having a child. Suman tells him that two years earlier, while she was pregnant, she fell off from the stairs. Dr. Verma was busy in an emergency duty and could not come to the hospital to see her and she lost the child. She regrets that if Verma had come that day, they would not have lost the child. The next night, Inder calls a prostitute  to his house and tells her to behave like Suman. But when she calls him Raja, Inder beats her black and blue and tells her that you are not Suman and the day will come when Suman will fall for him. Inder's friend Inspector Sule warns him to stop interfering in the life of Dr. Verma and Suman and that if he continues to do that, he will report this matter to the ACP. Inder ignores the warning and disconnects the telephone and electricity connection of Verma's house. At night, he enters Verma's house where Rohan and Suman are having sex. While finding Inder at such an uninviting position at his house, Rohan gets furious and along with his lawyer  goes to the ACP to lodge a complaint against Inder.

A giant chicken, about whom Tomoki apparently forgot, wreaks havoc on Sorami City, so Tomoki, via one of Ikaros' cards, has Sohara grown to giant size to fight the chicken, which she defeats, but then promptly steps on Tomoki for staring up her skirt. The film then switches to Daedalus who explains more about the Angeloids and their history, and then to a scene where an Angel is asleep in a pod. On Earth, Hiyori Kazane, a resident of Sorami City and the film's main heroine, introduces herself and explains how she met and fell in love with Tomoki, while also narrating about how she took part in several events from the two previous anime seasons, all the while observing Tomoki and his friends, and even becoming acquainted with most of them. After the recap, Hiyori decides she wants to be closer to Tomoki, so she asks to join the New World Discovery club, though Eishiro is against it, as he remembers seeing an Angel resembling Hiyori in Synapse  and is not yet sure what their reality is. He relents however, when Mikako mentions the clubs budget will increase with the new addition, which also means Tomoki must now fully participate in the club. Not happy with this, Tomoki decides to make Hiyori quit by subjecting her to various perverted, fake initiation tests, which Hiyori embarrassingly completes. Despite this, Hiyori's feelings for Tomoki remain unchanged and she is welcomed in to the club and participates in many activities with them, with even Tomoki accepting her presence and spending much time with her. This makes Sohara, Nymph, and Astraea believe they are dating, but wonder why, so Mikako suggests that Tomoki is blackmailing Hiyori. When the three girls confront Tomoki on this, Hiyori, who overheard everything, clears the misunderstanding and also confesses to Tomoki. Tomoki is left unsure of what to do, while Nymph and Ikaros understand that a relationship between Tomoki and Hiyori is impossible. In Synapse, Eishiro asks Daedalus about the relationship between Hiyori and the Angel that resembles her. When she does not answer, Eishiro mentions that when he first met Tomoki, he briefly forgot that they had met and asks if that is related to Synapse, to which Daedalus confirms. Eishiro decides to further investigate, while on Earth Tomoki goes to meet with Hiyori to give her a reply. On the way, Hiyori is run over by a truck and dies, causing her body to disappear and her existence to be erased from the memories of everyone not related to the Synapse. Realizing what is happening, Eishiro desperately runs to where the Angels in pods are but when he makes it he does not recognize the Hiyori in the pod. The Master of the Synapse appears and taunts Eishiro with his forgotten memories and mentions that Hiyori is awakening. Tomoki, unaware of Hiyori's fate, waits for her but when Nymph and Ikaros arrive, the former lies to him and tells him Hiyori will meet him tomorrow. To make up for her lying, Nymph spends the night with Tomoki and asks for the imprinting, but Tomoki explains that he wants her and the other angeloids to be free. Nymph says she wants to be imprinted because she is in love with Tomoki, but before she can convey her feelings Tomoki experiences severe headaches from the memory wipe, so Nymph holds him, knowing that by tomorrow Tomoki will have forgotten Hiyori. The next morning, Tomoki still clearly remembers Hiyori, while everyone else has forgotten her. Distraught, Tomoki runs over town searching for her, while in Synapse Hiyori is grief-stricken that her time on Earth has ended, so the Master of the Synapse offers her one more chance to see Tomoki. Tomoki confronts Ikaros and Nymph on what is happening, but Nymph explains they cannot tell him anything for fear of Tomoki learning that Hiyori is not the only part of his reality that isn't real. Tomoki collapses from the severe headache pain, so the two Angeloids including Astraea look after him. Nymph picks up something on her radar, so the three go to investigate, and find Hiyori. The reunion is cut short when, she is transformed into an Angeloid and is ordered by the Master of the Synapse to kill the three. Hiyori uses her ability of time manipulation to attack both Sorami City and the Angeloids, and easily overpowers the three. Nymph determines the only way to stop Hiyori is to kill her, though Ikaros objects, but Nymph reluctantly prepares to do so, until she is stopped by Tomoki, who swears to save Hiyori. The Master of the Synapse orders Hiyori to kill Tomoki, but Eishiro arrives to help, while the three Angeloids stall Hiyori. They manage to destroy the structure that binds her, but it does not free her. Nymph also realizes that the dimensional mechanism system that produces Hiyori's time altering powers has reached the breaking point causing a process that will result in the area around Hiyori, Sorami City, to be blown away. Unable to stop the process, Ikaros traps Hiyori within her Aegis to contain the blast, but also traps herself in since she does not want Hiyori to be alone in her final moments. Tomoki however hang glides to them and is let into the Aegis, where he is able to bring Hiyori back to her senses. Hiyori begs for them to get away as it won't be long before she self-destructs, so she uses her hacking abilities to dispel the Aegis, and kisses Tomoki before leaving. She thanks him and remembers how they met first met as children, and that it was because of him that she came to love Sorami City. She notes that while her time on Earth was short, she enjoyed her time with everyone and thanks her friends and Tomoki, and reaffirms her love for him before being destroyed. Tomoki breaks down in tears, and the film ends with him swearing that he will never forget Hiyori. Near the end of the credits, Sohara is seen viewing the scrapbook, filled with pictures of the group having fun. As Sohara leaves, a picture where Hiyori had faded away due to the Synapse's deletion, is seen where Hiyori slowly fades back in, revealing that she has somehow been revived. In a post-credits scene, Tomoki stands at the spot overlooking the city where he and Hiyori first met, and behind him a ray of light shines down with feathers falling from the sky, when he looks he smiles happily, and as the screen fades out, the sound of Hiyori's bell ornaments are heard, also, implying she was somehow revived.

Not happy with this, Tomoki decides to make Hiyori quit by subjecting her to various perverted, fake initiation tests, which Hiyori embarrassingly completes. Despite this, Hiyori's feelings for Tomoki remain unchanged and she is welcomed in to the club and participates in many activities with them, with even Tomoki accepting her presence and spending much time with her. This makes Sohara, Nymph, and Astraea believe they are dating, but wonder why, so Mikako suggests that Tomoki is blackmailing Hiyori. When the three girls confront Tomoki on this, Hiyori, who overheard everything, clears the misunderstanding and also confesses to Tomoki. Tomoki is left unsure of what to do, while Nymph and Ikaros understand that a relationship between Tomoki and Hiyori is impossible. In Synapse, Eishiro asks Daedalus about the relationship between Hiyori and the Angel that resembles her. When she does not answer, Eishiro mentions that when he first met Tomoki, he briefly forgot that they had met and asks if that is related to Synapse, to which Daedalus confirms. Eishiro decides to further investigate, while on Earth Tomoki goes to meet with Hiyori to give her a reply. On the way, Hiyori is run over by a truck and dies, causing her body to disappear and her existence to be erased from the memories of everyone not related to the Synapse. Realizing what is happening, Eishiro desperately runs to where the Angels in pods are but when he makes it he does not recognize the Hiyori in the pod. The Master of the Synapse appears and taunts Eishiro with his forgotten memories and mentions that Hiyori is awakening. Tomoki, unaware of Hiyori's fate, waits for her but when Nymph and Ikaros arrive, the former lies to him and tells him Hiyori will meet him tomorrow. To make up for her lying, Nymph spends the night with Tomoki and asks for the imprinting, but Tomoki explains that he wants her and the other angeloids to be free. Nymph says she wants to be imprinted because she is in love with Tomoki, but before she can convey her feelings Tomoki experiences severe headaches from the memory wipe, so Nymph holds him, knowing that by tomorrow Tomoki will have forgotten Hiyori. The next morning, Tomoki still clearly remembers Hiyori, while everyone else has forgotten her. Distraught, Tomoki runs over town searching for her, while in Synapse Hiyori is grief-stricken that her time on Earth has ended, so the Master of the Synapse offers her one more chance to see Tomoki. Tomoki confronts Ikaros and Nymph on what is happening, but Nymph explains they cannot tell him anything for fear of Tomoki learning that Hiyori is not the only part of his reality that isn't real. Tomoki collapses from the severe headache pain, so the two Angeloids including Astraea look after him. Nymph picks up something on her radar, so the three go to investigate, and find Hiyori. The reunion is cut short when, she is transformed into an Angeloid and is ordered by the Master of the Synapse to kill the three. Hiyori uses her ability of time manipulation to attack both Sorami City and the Angeloids, and easily overpowers the three. Nymph determines the only way to stop Hiyori is to kill her, though Ikaros objects, but Nymph reluctantly prepares to do so, until she is stopped by Tomoki, who swears to save Hiyori. The Master of the Synapse orders Hiyori to kill Tomoki, but Eishiro arrives to help, while the three Angeloids stall Hiyori. They manage to destroy the structure that binds her, but it does not free her. Nymph also realizes that the dimensional mechanism system that produces Hiyori's time altering powers has reached the breaking point causing a process that will result in the area around Hiyori, Sorami City, to be blown away. Unable to stop the process, Ikaros traps Hiyori within her Aegis to contain the blast, but also traps herself in since she does not want Hiyori to be alone in her final moments. Tomoki however hang glides to them and is let into the Aegis, where he is able to bring Hiyori back to her senses. Hiyori begs for them to get away as it won't be long before she self-destructs, so she uses her hacking abilities to dispel the Aegis, and kisses Tomoki before leaving. She thanks him and remembers how they met first met as children, and that it was because of him that she came to love Sorami City. She notes that while her time on Earth was short, she enjoyed her time with everyone and thanks her friends and Tomoki, and reaffirms her love for him before being destroyed. Tomoki breaks down in tears, and the film ends with him swearing that he will never forget Hiyori. Near the end of the credits, Sohara is seen viewing the scrapbook, filled with pictures of the group having fun. As Sohara leaves, a picture where Hiyori had faded away due to the Synapse's deletion, is seen where Hiyori slowly fades back in, revealing that she has somehow been revived. In a post-credits scene, Tomoki stands at the spot overlooking the city where he and Hiyori first met, and behind him a ray of light shines down with feathers falling from the sky, when he looks he smiles happily, and as the screen fades out, the sound of Hiyori's bell ornaments are heard, also, implying she was somehow revived.

Detectives look for a witness. Into the police office walks Min Soo-Ah . She used to be a promising cadet at the police academy, but after a horrific car accident which killed her surrogate brother, Soo-Ah's police career ended. Min Soo-Ah also lost her eyesight in the car accident. Min Soo-Ah reveals to Detective Jo  at the police station that on the night of the hit and run case she was picked up by a taxi cab driver. Soo-Ah believes the taxi driver may be the perpetrator of the crimes. Initially, Detective Jo doesn't take Soo-Ah's claims seriously because she is blind, but when Soo-Ah displays her acute senses the detective starts to believe her. Detective Jo and Min Soo-Ah then work together to find the taxi cab driver, but all their leads turn up empty. Then another witness comes forward Kwon Ki-Sub . Kwon Ki-Sub is a motorcycle delivery boy who claims to have also witness the hit and run incident. Kwon Ki-Sub also emphatically states that the car in question was not a taxi cab, but rather an imported sedan. Meanwhile, Min Soo-Ah finds herself being stalked by a mysterious man. [Spoiler] It turns out that the gynecologist, Myung Jin  is the mysterious man stalking her as well as the killer. Min Soo-ah, while in the car with him, remembered that he had a strong scent/cologne, he had a watch on his right hand, and he gave her an iced coffee drink in a glass can. While in the car with him, they hit a bump while in an argument. The body of the dead university student rolls out of the trunk and Myung Jin gets out to examine it. When Min Soo-Ah goes out as well to inspect the damage done, he claims that he hit a dog, but she reasons with him, starting another fight. He leaves her in the rain when another car comes. The reason why she was in the car with him is because she needed a ride back from visiting the orphanage she used to grow up in. She had gotten angry and stormed out because her ex-guardian tried to give her two things-- tickets to her dead brother's dance group's upcoming dance showdown, and a device that vibrates when a person or moving object-- or any object-- came too close. It would help her with her disability, but Min Soo-ah strongly disapproved of it. One night when Ki-Sub is walking home alone, he is followed by Myung Jin. Ki-Sub at first runs away, but is snuck up on and hit by a brick. An ambulance comes and the Detective/Min Soo-ah drives to the scene. When the Detective finishes up his interviews with the people and follows the ambulance to the hospital, we realize that Myung Jin was in the background, watching Min Soo-Ah in the car. At the hospital, the doctor tells them that because Ki-Sub has such a thick skull, only a small fracture was shown in the X-Ray scan. They are relieved and visits him. Ki-Sub gets annoyed by Min Soo-ah's constant nagging, and on the day of his release, storms out in anger. When he reaches the nearly-empty subway station, he sees Min Soo-ah on the other side and then sees her ride the subway, as well as the killer. He calls her on her phone and tells her urgently that the killer is in front of her. As he runs to catch up with her, she goes on Facetime and shows him her location and surroundings. He guides her out of the subway and to safety, as well as her seeing-dog, Seul-Gi . However, at one point, she trips, but gets up and feels the ground and way out . However, at one point, the killer catches up with her and leads her away, with a knife to her body. She reaches into her handbag and sprays his eyes with her pepper spray and runs off with Seul-Gi. When she reaches the elevator, she thought that she'd be safe, but the killer quickly gets in. Ki-Sub, who still sees her surroundings by Facetime, gets scared when he sees blood splatter on the elevator's button and the fact that Min Soo-Ah fainted. However, what they didn't know at the time was that Seul-Gi shielded Min Soo-Ah from the knife and while she was getting stabbed, grabbed the killer by the jacket and led him out of the elevator. In that scene, Seul-Gi dies by being stabbed many times while watching her owner go up through the elevator. When Min Soo-Ah wakes up, she asks for her seeing dog, but the doctor handed her the blood-stained leash. At home, Min Soo-Ah listens to many video tapes of her past self, when she had just graduated from the police academy. She laid down and listened to her brother's voice, as well as the voice of the orphanage lady. Halfway through, she gets a call from an unknown number. There is a raspy voice. The caller warns her from this case. ""You can't see me, but I'm watching you."" A few days later, the Detective had narrowed down the number of licensed imported black Sedans and finally, in a garage, he finds the killer. They get into a violent fight, in which the detective dies and the killer drives off. Meanwhile, Ki-Sub and Min Soo-Ah visits the orphanage again when they're asked to watch over it while the grandmother takes the children out. Ki-Sub finds the dead brother's room and various pictures. Min Soo-Ah goes to the 'office' and finds a cabinet filled with her past memories as a cop, as well as the vibrating motion sensor. The killer enters into the living room and lights a cigarette and listens to some music. Min Soo-Ah, annoyed by the music, goes downstairs to turn it off. She reprimands Ki-Sub for playing it, but smells the cigarette. Ki-Sub goes upstairs and fights with Myung Jin while Min Soo-Ah runs away. After a few minutes of them playing Cat and Mouse, she lights him on fire and takes the vibrating motion sensor. She helps Ki-Sub outside, where it's raining. Ki-Sub fights the killer again and Min Soo-Ah goes to the car and breaks it with the motion sensor. The killer runs at her with a knife and with the right timing and the motion sensor, she hits him on the head, making him fall unconsious. The police, who had picked up the Detective's body, had found the evidence and eventually found out who the killer was. The killer was put in jail and Min Soo-Ah was re-admitted to the academy and graduated again. Ki-Sub also enrolled into the police academy. It ends with another video, similar to the video of her first graduation, except instead of her surrogate brother, it had Ki-Sub. While the credits roll, you see pictures of them respectfully visiting the Detective's funeral."

During a battle against a robotic tank, Ben as Upgrade and Gwen argue about the best way to defeat it, leading to Gwen using a dismantling spell on the tank while Ben is attached. Unknown to the children, this leads to a malfunction in the Omnitrix. Later, after a mishap in school where the Omnitrix accidentally teleports his homework, Ben is grounded by his parents and forced to stay home and do a history report. Ben attempts to work on the report before the Omnitrix teleports it away, as well. Shortly afterwards, Tetrax Shard arrives and tells Ben that Azmuth has asked to meet with him. They go to meet Azmuth but are attacked by an evil version of Waybig. Tetrax and Ben fight the alien, who is also teleported into the Omnitrix, though neither of them is aware of it. Tetrax decides to take Ben to meet Azmuth and activates a new function on the Omnitrix. Before he can explain this new ability, the ship is attacked and Ben is sucked out into the atmosphere, falling to the ground as Diamondhead. It is later revealed that the new ability prevents Ben from returning to human form when he times out, simply switching alien forms. Ben as Fourarms arrives at Stonehenge and is attacked by a Galvanic Mechamorph who demands to know about the alien that attacked Ben. Ben tries to explain, but the warrior only continues to attack and the pair carry their battle across the globe, destroying most of Stonehenge and nearly damaging The Statue of Jesus in Rio de Janeiro before arriving back in Bellwood. Ben transforms into Grey Matter and manages to escape the Mechamorph. Meanwhile, Gwen and Grandpa Max receive a call from Ben's parents informing them that Ben has escaped the house. They go in search of him, only to find Tetrax and discover that Azmuth's ship  has crashed and was destroyed by the evil Waybig. They soon encounter Ben and Tetrax restores Ben's Omnitrix to normal just as the Mechamorph catches up to them. Gwen sees how the Omnitrix reacts after Ben returns to human form and deduces what has happened just as she, Ben, Tetrax and the Mechamorph are transported into the Omnitrix. Inside, Ben and the Mechamorph continue to battle before being attacked by a swarm of Stinkflys just as Gwen and Tetrax are ambushed by a herd of Wildmutt. The four catch up with each other and Gwen explains what has happened and they realize that the evil Waybig is inside with them just as he resurfaces. The Mechamorph, revealed to be Azmuth's father, attacks the Waybig in revenge for killing his son while Gwen uses him to reverse the transportation and return them to Earth. Unfortunately, the Omnitrix malfunctions again and transforms Ben's parents into Wildmutt and Heatblast, causing Gwen to realize that the evil Waybig is Azmuth, himself. Leaving Grandpa Max and Tetrax to handle the parents, Ben and Gwen follow Azmuth's father and the evil Waybig to the park where Ben transforms into Waybig to subdue Azmuth while he and Gwen try to reverse the transformation. They soon convince Azmuth's father that his son is the very alien they are fighting and the three work together to fix the Omnitrix and return Azmuth to normal. Azmuth reprimands Ben and Gwen for their errors and releases his father from the Mechamorph armor. Returning to Ben's house, Azmuth restores his parents and repairs the Rustbucket before leaving with his father. Ben's parents, having forgotten that they grounded Ben, tell him to enjoy his fishing trip with Grandpa Max and Gwen. Ben declines, having learned to be more responsible, and stays home to finish his history report. The movie ends with Ben, Gwen and Grandpa Max on another summer road trip where they encounter Doctor Animo and the three prepare for another exciting battle.

Upon returning home from a yet another long day of work at the ""Cafe Gardania,"" Emily, Blair's younger sister, is watching the annual ""Princess Procession"" on TV, which involves princesses from many other kingdoms coming to enroll at the original Princess Charm School  in order to learn their full potential. In addition, each semester one commoner is also allowed enrollment if she wins the ""lottery"" that awards her a full scholarship, as well as the chance to become a ""Lady Royal,"" a princess's most trusted advisor. Blair asks if their mom is okay as the two watch the television, and Emily tells her that the doctors have simply said that she was ""comfortable"". Blair wishes she were better, and also that Emily could grow up within a better neighborhood, as the family lives in the more destitute area of Gardania and have little money. Blair decides that she will continue to work hard for her family. On the TV, Blair, Emily and their mother, who later joins them, watch as the lottery winner is picked . . . Blair. Absolutely stunned by this, Blair then learns from her little sister that the reason her name had been drawn was due to the fact that Emily had secretly entered her Blair's name many times per day. Initially, Blair doesn't wish to leave her responsibilities to her family behind, but her mother, who sees it as a good opportunity for her daughter , manages to convince her. Blair parts ways with her family and leaves to go the school within a carriage driven by a man named Brock, who is an employee working there. At the school, Blair is greeted by a large Golden Retriever named Prince, which curiously takes an immediate shining to her. The Headmistress of the school, Alexandra Privet, finding Blair on the floor with Prince  then takes her to her locker, and explains things about the school along the way. Blair, at her locker, is suddenly met by a magical sprite named Grace. She turns out to be Blair's assigned, personal princess assistant, as every student within attendance at the charm school possesses, as well. Blair uses her magically-infused locker to change into her school uniform, and then Grace takes her to her dorm room in order to get settled in. There, Blair meets her new roommates : Isla  and Hadley . She also meets their sprite assistants, Caprice and Harmony. After their brief introductions have been made, a sudden announcement is heard from Miss Privet, stating that every student is to now head over to the ""Starlight Welcome"" immediately, in order to receive their training crowns. At the welcome ceremony, Miss Privet explains that they will get real crowns once they have successfully completed the semester with high expectations. Another teacher of the school, Dame Devin, then announces that she will soon quit her job of instructing at the Princess Charm School after her daughter, Delancy  becomes the new princess of Gardania at the end of the semester. She goes on to explain that both she and her daughter have lived at the royal palace since the time of her sister-in-law, Queen Isabella, and her family's death within a car crash many years ago. Isla and Hadley, seated with the rest of their fellow students, then quietly discuss with Blair a well known legend which states that not everyone from the Royal Family had died. After the ceremony, each student has a curtsying class before dismissal for the evening, and Blair gets distracted by Hadley and Isla's continued tale and bumps into Delancy, who seems to have already developed quite a strong dislike for Blair, and openly expresses her disdain over the school's lottery system of allowing commoners to enroll. Isla and Hadley comfort Blair, telling her that they are positive that Blair can do anything Delancy can do. The next day, Blair's momentary confident instantly becomes unraveled upon witnessing Delancy being able to walk about with a very large stack of books on her head without any sort of difficulty during one of their lessons, when she, herself, can't even balance one. Many of the other girls, however, do have a few problems, themselves, but Dame Devin, the lesson's instructor, seems more keen upon singling Blair out the most. However, upon getting a better view of Blair's face, Dame Devin becomes immediately, and curiously shocked. She then ruthlessly tells her to get out of her class and states that she doesn't belong at such an establishment. Later on, at lunch, Delancy inspired by her mother's viciousness, makes her sprite assistant, Wickellia, secretly tuck a piece of tablecloth into Blair's skirt while she, Isla, and Hadley unknowingly continue on within their meals. As a result, Blair ends up being further embarrassed with herself when she unexpectedly drags each girl's trays clear off of the table upon standing. Back within their dorm room, Isla and Hadley try to cheer up Blair by telling her that Dame Devin, herself, was once a lottery winner, as well. However, none of the princesses at the time had selected her to be their Lady Royal, not even Queen Isabella. Afterwards, a knock upon their door is heard, and Hadley goes to open it, revealing a struggling Grace holding onto a large care package addressed to Blair, from her sister Emily. Inside are various letters and other items, including a drawing of a baby Blair being left on their mother's doorstep. Blair explains to her curious friends that she is adopted, and so too, is Emily, and that the drawing is in reference to a tale which is favorite of Emily's , in that Blair had suddenly been found upon their mother's doorstep when Blair was one-year-old. Miss Privet, who arrives at the girls' dorm room in order to tell Blair a bit of bad news regarding her continued enrollment, then stops herself from doing so upon unintentionally eavesdropping. The following day, this time at a ballroom dancing class, Blair continually manages to step onto the toes of Delancy's friend, Portia, who is Blair's dance partner. As a result, Blair is kept behind after class by Miss Privet, who had been the instructor. Now alone, she tells Blair that Dame Devin wanted her to be expelled, a desire which had almost been granted; however, Miss Privet admits to Blair that she is aware of her personal reasons for wanting to become a Lady Royal , and so decides to tutor her, herself. She goes on to explain to Blair that each lesson her students learn simply isn't for superficial reasons, but rather to instill a better sense of character and confidence within each of girl. Confidence without character can be a problem, just like, within Blair's case, character without confidence can be, as well, according to Miss Privet. She then stresses to Blair that no one can make her feel inferior without her consent. And so, with the now added assistance of Miss Privet, Blair gradually begins to improve within her areas of balance, grace, dancing and more over time. As wintertime arrives, the charm school students are one day joined by the young men from the ""Prince Charming School""  for one of their dance classes. Blair inevitably gets partnered with a young prince-to-be named Nicholas, who appears to be every bit as down to earth and friendly as she. As a result, the two seem to hit it off, as they share various jokes with one another while dancing. Jealous, as she had been hoping to dance with Nicholas, herself, Delancy trips Blair in order to once again humiliate her; however, Nicholas helps Blair quickly recover, as the two lead the overall group  within an abrupt transition from traditional ballroom dancing, to something much more modern. before dancing like they're at a party. When they are done, the men leave, much to the regret of the women, but Miss Privet assures them that they will again return in order to attend the dual graduation ceremony, and coronation of Delancy as the princess of Gardania at the end of the semester. Springtime eventually arrives, and now with only two days before the ceremony, where both the princesses and Lady Royals will be crowned, Miss Privet announces that the girls will get to spend another one of their table manners classes within the palace this time. Blair, Hadley and Isla go with their sprites  to pamper themselves within the school spa as a preparatory treat, while Dame Devin secretly instructs Wickellia to rip up the girls' uniforms . Meanwhile, Isla and Hadley continue to tell Blair more legends about the Royal Family, including one about Gardania's magic crown, which lights up when put upon the head of the rightful heir to the throne. The girls head back to their room to find it in shambles, and their uniforms torn to shreds. As both Isla and Hadley lament over the fact that they cannot attend class without them on, and that missing any class will result within an automatic failure, Blair, having now grown a bit more confident over time, is then overcome with sudden determination. She refuses to let her or her friends fail, and so with the help of the sprites fashions some new, personalized uniforms using leftover fabric from the old ones. Having just made it to the palace in time, Blair, Isla, Hadley, and the rest of the students are awarded a bit of free time to explore the first floor before the start of class. While doing so, the trio mysteriously find a portrait of Blair, which actually turns out to be one of the then Princess Isabella, when she was eighteen-years-old, a year older than Blair. The girls then see a portrait of the entire Royal Family: Queen Isabella, her husband, King Reginald, a puppy which Blair is stunned to realize is actually Prince, the dog, and a young baby girl in the Queen's arms. Upon further inspection of the portrait, Hadley and Isla begin to surmise that perhaps Blair could be the baby from the picture, and proceed to ask her when exactly it was that her mother had found her as a baby. Blair reveals the date to be April 26th, a date which had also become her birthday when her mother find her on her doorstep, as she didn't know when Blair was actually born. Stunned, however now more convinced than ever that their suspicions are correct, both Isla and Hadley reveal to Blair that April 26th was the very same day that the Royal Family had perished within their car accident. They go on to say that they believe that perhaps Princess Sophia hadn't died with the King and Queen, after all, but rather had been found and left in front of somebody else's door to be raised. This hypothesis also makes them realize that this was the most probable reason why Dame Devin and Delancy have continually been so unfair to Blair, because she and Princess Sophia are one in the same and thus, is the rightful heir to the throne of Gardania. Unbeknownst to the trio, Delancy has eavesdropped upon the entire conversation, and promptly becomes disturbed by the news, as her mother had never told her these things. Later on at class, Dame Devin reveals to her students her intentions for Gardania  once her daughter is made princess: to bulldoze the beggared areas of the land and create parks in its stead, in order to make the overall kingdom more beautiful. Blair is shocked appalled by this, and informs her that her family lives there, but Dame Devin heartlessly remarks that she should then leave the school immediately in order to move her family to a new home in time, not at all caring that such an act would be impossible for them, as they have no money. Blair looks at Delancy, trying to talk to her to see sense, but Delancy remains silent, though she is herself worried about what her mother will do further when she is a princess. Blair runs away in her room, feeling utterly broken and defeated. She does do as Dame Devin had instructed and packs up her belongings in order to leave the school once and for all; however, upon gazing at her sister Emily's sent drawing once more, decides to stay and to finally fight back. Meeting back up with Hadley and Isla, Blair informs them that she intends to locate the magical crown so that she can use it to prove that she is the rightful heir, and thus successfully stop Dame Devin and Delancy's plans from coming to fruition. Her friends naturally volunteer to help, and so the trio then plan to go back to the palace later that night to search for it, before the graduation and coronation the following day. That evening, before the girls can leave, a fire alarm suddenly goes off. The students all go outside accordingly, while Dame Devin secretly places several pieces of her jewelery within Blair, Hadley and Isla's dorm room in order to implicate them and finally have them expelled. Delancy finds her leaving the room and becomes suspicious, but her mother quickly changes the subject by asking her why she suddenly has a customized uniform like Blair and her friends, to which Delancy coolly explains it's simply because she likes the way it looks. A little more than half an hour later, the students can finally go back into their rooms, but Blair, Isla and Hadley are abruptly stopped by a guard, Dame Devin, and Miss Privet. They are then accused of stealing Dame Devin's jewelery, about which they naturally dispute. However, upon searching their dorm room, the guard successfully locates each missing valuable. The girls are then to be detained until after the coronation ceremony; however, while the guard takes them away, Delancy suddenly approaches and stops him, claiming that she wishes to carry out their punishment, herself . At first hesitant to listen to her, the gevery student within attendance es and she hesitantly asks Blair if she truly is Princess Sophia, to which Blair responds that she believes she is. Delancy then quickly hands over a map of the palace basement where the magical crown can be located, further revealing to them that she is assisting their efforts because she wants to do what is right for the kingdom. Before parting ways, she also tells them she will leave a window open on the third floor of the palace for them to enter through, and then runs off back to her room, as her mother believes her to already be asleep. Blair, Hadley and Isla head back to the palace, and find Prince thankfully distracting another guard for them. They then use a rope from their bag to climb up to the third floor window, before then taking an elevator inside to the basement. Hadley notices devices on the walls within the room, and recognizes them as laser alarms, whose beams are invisible and will set off its detection if any are stepped through. And so Blair carefully blows a bit of makeup powder towards the lasers in order to make them become visible. Hadley, the most athletic of the three, utilizes some of her impressive gymnastics abilities in order to bypass the beams and make it to the other side, while both Blair and Isla make a far more slower trek across, with some help from Grace. Once there, there is a keypad which needs a password to unlock a vault door, most probably where the magical crown is being held, so they try the date of the coronation. It is incorrect, however, and so they use the password hint  to figure out the real password. They then try the date of the car crash and it works. Inside the room are several of Dame Devin's possessions. Blair and her friends find the magical crown, but Dame Devin finds them, and makes Brock, her guard, seize the crown from them. She then changes the password, with Isla memorizing the tune of the pressed buttons, and locks them inside of the vault. The girls are stuck within the vault for several hours, right up to when the coronation begins and Delancy becomes moments away from being officially crowned. Seeing that they have yet to arrive, she figures out how to stall the proceedings while Blair and her friends try to find a way to escape. Isla, meanwhile, keeps humming the tune of the keypad buttons, and Hadley, who had been attempting to pry open the vault doors with a sword she had found, accidentally knocks the cover off a nearby box of electrical wires. Seeing this and realizing that it is most likely connected to the vault's stored password, they wire up Blair's phone to the keypad to use her phone buttons to enter the password from inside of the room. Isla, having memorized the new password, she carefully hums out the tune before entering it onto the phone. Successful, they finally make their hurried escape. The girls arrive at the graduation ceremony just in time, and Blair confidently makes an open claim to the throne, stating that she is Princess Sophia. Emily and her mother, who are watching the action at the TV, gasped in shock. The royal judge, who crowns the princesses and Lady Royals, takes Blair seriously, but Dame Devin, now furious, tries to stop her. They begin to fight over the crown, before Delancy manages to catch it and then has to decide whether to give it to her mother or to Blair. In the end, she chose to give it to Blair, and when she puts it on, it immediately illuminates and transforms her appearance magically, to look more like a princess. Dame Devin, amidst her outrage, exclaims that she killed Queen Isabella just so that Delancy could be the princess, instead, and thus is arrested, while a disheartened Delancy watches on as she gets dragged away. At Miss Privet's prompting, Blair makes a quick, introductory speech, telling the people of Gardania that she is honored to be their princess. Miss Privet then tells her that now is the time when she must select a Lady Royal, and Blair, feeling sympathy for Delancy for helping her so much in this mission, chooses Delancy, who is delighted and then crowned. Later that evening, at the graduation party, everyone dances to Isla's one of her finally revealed songs, ""We Rule This School,"" which she also DJs for. Even Miss Privet dances along with her students, while the now Prince Nicholas arrives and meets up with Blair again. He states that he is unsure of whether to call her Blair or Princess Sophia, but she assures him that she wants to continue going by the name ""Blair."" The new Lady Royal, Delancy, then announces that the Princess has some special visitors, which are revealed to be Emily and her mother. Blair welcomes them to their ""new home"". Emily then asks Blair if, since Blair is now a princess, does that also make her one, as well. Blair warmly tells her: ""Of course; there's a princess in every girl,"" before stating that she wishes to introduce both she and their mother to everyone."

Upon returning home from a yet another long day of work at the ""Cafe Gardania,"" Emily, Blair's younger sister, is watching the annual ""Princess Procession"" on TV, which involves princesses from many other kingdoms coming to enroll at the original Princess Charm School  in order to learn their full potential. In addition, each semester one commoner is also allowed enrollment if she wins the ""lottery"" that awards her a full scholarship, as well as the chance to become a ""Lady Royal,"" a princess's most trusted advisor. Blair asks if their mom is okay as the two watch the television, and Emily tells her that the doctors have simply said that she was ""comfortable"". Blair wishes she were better, and also that Emily could grow up within a better neighborhood, as the family lives in the more destitute area of Gardania and have little money. Blair decides that she will continue to work hard for her family. On the TV, Blair, Emily and their mother, who later joins them, watch as the lottery winner is picked . . . Blair. Absolutely stunned by this, Blair then learns from her little sister that the reason her name had been drawn was due to the fact that Emily had secretly entered her Blair's name many times per day. Initially, Blair doesn't wish to leave her responsibilities to her family behind, but her mother, who sees it as a good opportunity for her daughter , manages to convince her. Blair parts ways with her family and leaves to go the school within a carriage driven by a man named Brock, who is an employee working there. At the school, Blair is greeted by a large Golden Retriever named Prince, which curiously takes an immediate shining to her. The Headmistress of the school, Alexandra Privet, finding Blair on the floor with Prince  then takes her to her locker, and explains things about the school along the way. Blair, at her locker, is suddenly met by a magical sprite named Grace. She turns out to be Blair's assigned, personal princess assistant, as every student within attendance at the charm school possesses, as well. Blair uses her magically-infused locker to change into her school uniform, and then Grace takes her to her dorm room in order to get settled in. There, Blair meets her new roommates : Isla  and Hadley . She also meets their sprite assistants, Caprice and Harmony. After their brief introductions have been made, a sudden announcement is heard from Miss Privet, stating that every student is to now head over to the ""Starlight Welcome"" immediately, in order to receive their training crowns. At the welcome ceremony, Miss Privet explains that they will get real crowns once they have successfully completed the semester with high expectations. Another teacher of the school, Dame Devin, then announces that she will soon quit her job of instructing at the Princess Charm School after her daughter, Delancy  becomes the new princess of Gardania at the end of the semester. She goes on to explain that both she and her daughter have lived at the royal palace since the time of her sister-in-law, Queen Isabella, and her family's death within a car crash many years ago. Isla and Hadley, seated with the rest of their fellow students, then quietly discuss with Blair a well known legend which states that not everyone from the Royal Family had died. After the ceremony, each student has a curtsying class before dismissal for the evening, and Blair gets distracted by Hadley and Isla's continued tale and bumps into Delancy, who seems to have already developed quite a strong dislike for Blair, and openly expresses her disdain over the school's lottery system of allowing commoners to enroll. Isla and Hadley comfort Blair, telling her that they are positive that Blair can do anything Delancy can do. The next day, Blair's momentary confident instantly becomes unraveled upon witnessing Delancy being able to walk about with a very large stack of books on her head without any sort of difficulty during one of their lessons, when she, herself, can't even balance one. Many of the other girls, however, do have a few problems, themselves, but Dame Devin, the lesson's instructor, seems more keen upon singling Blair out the most. However, upon getting a better view of Blair's face, Dame Devin becomes immediately, and curiously shocked. She then ruthlessly tells her to get out of her class and states that she doesn't belong at such an establishment. Later on, at lunch, Delancy inspired by her mother's viciousness, makes her sprite assistant, Wickellia, secretly tuck a piece of tablecloth into Blair's skirt while she, Isla, and Hadley unknowingly continue on within their meals. As a result, Blair ends up being further embarrassed with herself when she unexpectedly drags each girl's trays clear off of the table upon standing. Back within their dorm room, Isla and Hadley try to cheer up Blair by telling her that Dame Devin, herself, was once a lottery winner, as well. However, none of the princesses at the time had selected her to be their Lady Royal, not even Queen Isabella. Afterwards, a knock upon their door is heard, and Hadley goes to open it, revealing a struggling Grace holding onto a large care package addressed to Blair, from her sister Emily. Inside are various letters and other items, including a drawing of a baby Blair being left on their mother's doorstep. Blair explains to her curious friends that she is adopted, and so too, is Emily, and that the drawing is in reference to a tale which is favorite of Emily's , in that Blair had suddenly been found upon their mother's doorstep when Blair was one-year-old. Miss Privet, who arrives at the girls' dorm room in order to tell Blair a bit of bad news regarding her continued enrollment, then stops herself from doing so upon unintentionally eavesdropping. The following day, this time at a ballroom dancing class, Blair continually manages to step onto the toes of Delancy's friend, Portia, who is Blair's dance partner. As a result, Blair is kept behind after class by Miss Privet, who had been the instructor. Now alone, she tells Blair that Dame Devin wanted her to be expelled, a desire which had almost been granted; however, Miss Privet admits to Blair that she is aware of her personal reasons for wanting to become a Lady Royal , and so decides to tutor her, herself. She goes on to explain to Blair that each lesson her students learn simply isn't for superficial reasons, but rather to instill a better sense of character and confidence within each of girl. Confidence without character can be a problem, just like, within Blair's case, character without confidence can be, as well, according to Miss Privet. She then stresses to Blair that no one can make her feel inferior without her consent. And so, with the now added assistance of Miss Privet, Blair gradually begins to improve within her areas of balance, grace, dancing and more over time. As wintertime arrives, the charm school students are one day joined by the young men from the ""Prince Charming School""  for one of their dance classes. Blair inevitably gets partnered with a young prince-to-be named Nicholas, who appears to be every bit as down to earth and friendly as she. As a result, the two seem to hit it off, as they share various jokes with one another while dancing. Jealous, as she had been hoping to dance with Nicholas, herself, Delancy trips Blair in order to once again humiliate her; however, Nicholas helps Blair quickly recover, as the two lead the overall group  within an abrupt transition from traditional ballroom dancing, to something much more modern. before dancing like they're at a party.

And so, with the now added assistance of Miss Privet, Blair gradually begins to improve within her areas of balance, grace, dancing and more over time. As wintertime arrives, the charm school students are one day joined by the young men from the ""Prince Charming School""  for one of their dance classes. Blair inevitably gets partnered with a young prince-to-be named Nicholas, who appears to be every bit as down to earth and friendly as she. As a result, the two seem to hit it off, as they share various jokes with one another while dancing. Jealous, as she had been hoping to dance with Nicholas, herself, Delancy trips Blair in order to once again humiliate her; however, Nicholas helps Blair quickly recover, as the two lead the overall group  within an abrupt transition from traditional ballroom dancing, to something much more modern. before dancing like they're at a party. When they are done, the men leave, much to the regret of the women, but Miss Privet assures them that they will again return in order to attend the dual graduation ceremony, and coronation of Delancy as the princess of Gardania at the end of the semester. Springtime eventually arrives, and now with only two days before the ceremony, where both the princesses and Lady Royals will be crowned, Miss Privet announces that the girls will get to spend another one of their table manners classes within the palace this time. Blair, Hadley and Isla go with their sprites  to pamper themselves within the school spa as a preparatory treat, while Dame Devin secretly instructs Wickellia to rip up the girls' uniforms . Meanwhile, Isla and Hadley continue to tell Blair more legends about the Royal Family, including one about Gardania's magic crown, which lights up when put upon the head of the rightful heir to the throne. The girls head back to their room to find it in shambles, and their uniforms torn to shreds. As both Isla and Hadley lament over the fact that they cannot attend class without them on, and that missing any class will result within an automatic failure, Blair, having now grown a bit more confident over time, is then overcome with sudden determination. She refuses to let her or her friends fail, and so with the help of the sprites fashions some new, personalized uniforms using leftover fabric from the old ones. Having just made it to the palace in time, Blair, Isla, Hadley, and the rest of the students are awarded a bit of free time to explore the first floor before the start of class. While doing so, the trio mysteriously find a portrait of Blair, which actually turns out to be one of the then Princess Isabella, when she was eighteen-years-old, a year older than Blair. The girls then see a portrait of the entire Royal Family: Queen Isabella, her husband, King Reginald, a puppy which Blair is stunned to realize is actually Prince, the dog, and a young baby girl in the Queen's arms. Upon further inspection of the portrait, Hadley and Isla begin to surmise that perhaps Blair could be the baby from the picture, and proceed to ask her when exactly it was that her mother had found her as a baby. Blair reveals the date to be April 26th, a date which had also become her birthday when her mother find her on her doorstep, as she didn't know when Blair was actually born. Stunned, however now more convinced than ever that their suspicions are correct, both Isla and Hadley reveal to Blair that April 26th was the very same day that the Royal Family had perished within their car accident. They go on to say that they believe that perhaps Princess Sophia hadn't died with the King and Queen, after all, but rather had been found and left in front of somebody else's door to be raised. This hypothesis also makes them realize that this was the most probable reason why Dame Devin and Delancy have continually been so unfair to Blair, because she and Princess Sophia are one in the same and thus, is the rightful heir to the throne of Gardania. Unbeknownst to the trio, Delancy has eavesdropped upon the entire conversation, and promptly becomes disturbed by the news, as her mother had never told her these things. Later on at class, Dame Devin reveals to her students her intentions for Gardania  once her daughter is made princess: to bulldoze the beggared areas of the land and create parks in its stead, in order to make the overall kingdom more beautiful. Blair is shocked appalled by this, and informs her that her family lives there, but Dame Devin heartlessly remarks that she should then leave the school immediately in order to move her family to a new home in time, not at all caring that such an act would be impossible for them, as they have no money. Blair looks at Delancy, trying to talk to her to see sense, but Delancy remains silent, though she is herself worried about what her mother will do further when she is a princess. Blair runs away in her room, feeling utterly broken and defeated. She does do as Dame Devin had instructed and packs up her belongings in order to leave the school once and for all; however, upon gazing at her sister Emily's sent drawing once more, decides to stay and to finally fight back. Meeting back up with Hadley and Isla, Blair informs them that she intends to locate the magical crown so that she can use it to prove that she is the rightful heir, and thus successfully stop Dame Devin and Delancy's plans from coming to fruition. Her friends naturally volunteer to help, and so the trio then plan to go back to the palace later that night to search for it, before the graduation and coronation the following day. That evening, before the girls can leave, a fire alarm suddenly goes off. The students all go outside accordingly, while Dame Devin secretly places several pieces of her jewelery within Blair, Hadley and Isla's dorm room in order to implicate them and finally have them expelled. Delancy finds her leaving the room and becomes suspicious, but her mother quickly changes the subject by asking her why she suddenly has a customized uniform like Blair and her friends, to which Delancy coolly explains it's simply because she likes the way it looks. A little more than half an hour later, the students can finally go back into their rooms, but Blair, Isla and Hadley are abruptly stopped by a guard, Dame Devin, and Miss Privet. They are then accused of stealing Dame Devin's jewelery, about which they naturally dispute. However, upon searching their dorm room, the guard successfully locates each missing valuable. The girls are then to be detained until after the coronation ceremony; however, while the guard takes them away, Delancy suddenly approaches and stops him, claiming that she wishes to carry out their punishment, herself . At first hesitant to listen to her, the gevery student within attendance es and she hesitantly asks Blair if she truly is Princess Sophia, to which Blair responds that she believes she is. Delancy then quickly hands over a map of the palace basement where the magical crown can be located, further revealing to them that she is assisting their efforts because she wants to do what is right for the kingdom. Before parting ways, she also tells them she will leave a window open on the third floor of the palace for them to enter through, and then runs off back to her room, as her mother believes her to already be asleep. Blair, Hadley and Isla head back to the palace, and find Prince thankfully distracting another guard for them. They then use a rope from their bag to climb up to the third floor window, before then taking an elevator inside to the basement. Hadley notices devices on the walls within the room, and recognizes them as laser alarms, whose beams are invisible and will set off its detection if any are stepped through. And so Blair carefully blows a bit of makeup powder towards the lasers in order to make them become visible. Hadley, the most athletic of the three, utilizes some of her impressive gymnastics abilities in order to bypass the beams and make it to the other side, while both Blair and Isla make a far more slower trek across, with some help from Grace. Once there, there is a keypad which needs a password to unlock a vault door, most probably where the magical crown is being held, so they try the date of the coronation. It is incorrect, however, and so they use the password hint  to figure out the real password. They then try the date of the car crash and it works. Inside the room are several of Dame Devin's possessions. Blair and her friends find the magical crown, but Dame Devin finds them, and makes Brock, her guard, seize the crown from them. She then changes the password, with Isla memorizing the tune of the pressed buttons, and locks them inside of the vault. The girls are stuck within the vault for several hours, right up to when the coronation begins and Delancy becomes moments away from being officially crowned. Seeing that they have yet to arrive, she figures out how to stall the proceedings while Blair and her friends try to find a way to escape. Isla, meanwhile, keeps humming the tune of the keypad buttons, and Hadley, who had been attempting to pry open the vault doors with a sword she had found, accidentally knocks the cover off a nearby box of electrical wires. Seeing this and realizing that it is most likely connected to the vault's stored password, they wire up Blair's phone to the keypad to use her phone buttons to enter the password from inside of the room. Isla, having memorized the new password, she carefully hums out the tune before entering it onto the phone. Successful, they finally make their hurried escape. The girls arrive at the graduation ceremony just in time, and Blair confidently makes an open claim to the throne, stating that she is Princess Sophia. Emily and her mother, who are watching the action at the TV, gasped in shock. The royal judge, who crowns the princesses and Lady Royals, takes Blair seriously, but Dame Devin, now furious, tries to stop her. They begin to fight over the crown, before Delancy manages to catch it and then has to decide whether to give it to her mother or to Blair. In the end, she chose to give it to Blair, and when she puts it on, it immediately illuminates and transforms her appearance magically, to look more like a princess. Dame Devin, amidst her outrage, exclaims that she killed Queen Isabella just so that Delancy could be the princess, instead, and thus is arrested, while a disheartened Delancy watches on as she gets dragged away. At Miss Privet's prompting, Blair makes a quick, introductory speech, telling the people of Gardania that she is honored to be their princess. Miss Privet then tells her that now is the time when she must select a Lady Royal, and Blair, feeling sympathy for Delancy for helping her so much in this mission, chooses Delancy, who is delighted and then crowned. Later that evening, at the graduation party, everyone dances to Isla's one of her finally revealed songs, ""We Rule This School,"" which she also DJs for. Even Miss Privet dances along with her students, while the now Prince Nicholas arrives and meets up with Blair again. He states that he is unsure of whether to call her Blair or Princess Sophia, but she assures him that she wants to continue going by the name ""Blair."" The new Lady Royal, Delancy, then announces that the Princess has some special visitors, which are revealed to be Emily and her mother. Blair welcomes them to their ""new home"". Emily then asks Blair if, since Blair is now a princess, does that also make her one, as well. Blair warmly tells her: ""Of course; there's a princess in every girl,"" before stating that she wishes to introduce both she and their mother to everyone."

Upon returning home from a yet another long day of work at the ""Cafe Gardania,"" Emily, Blair's younger sister, is watching the annual ""Princess Procession"" on TV, which involves princesses from many other kingdoms coming to enroll at the original Princess Charm School  in order to learn their full potential. In addition, each semester one commoner is also allowed enrollment if she wins the ""lottery"" that awards her a full scholarship, as well as the chance to become a ""Lady Royal,"" a princess's most trusted advisor. Blair asks if their mom is okay as the two watch the television, and Emily tells her that the doctors have simply said that she was ""comfortable"". Blair wishes she were better, and also that Emily could grow up within a better neighborhood, as the family lives in the more destitute area of Gardania and have little money. Blair decides that she will continue to work hard for her family. On the TV, Blair, Emily and their mother, who later joins them, watch as the lottery winner is picked . . . Blair. Absolutely stunned by this, Blair then learns from her little sister that the reason her name had been drawn was due to the fact that Emily had secretly entered her Blair's name many times per day. Initially, Blair doesn't wish to leave her responsibilities to her family behind, but her mother, who sees it as a good opportunity for her daughter , manages to convince her. Blair parts ways with her family and leaves to go the school within a carriage driven by a man named Brock, who is an employee working there. At the school, Blair is greeted by a large Golden Retriever named Prince, which curiously takes an immediate shining to her. The Headmistress of the school, Alexandra Privet, finding Blair on the floor with Prince  then takes her to her locker, and explains things about the school along the way. Blair, at her locker, is suddenly met by a magical sprite named Grace. She turns out to be Blair's assigned, personal princess assistant, as every student within attendance at the charm school possesses, as well. Blair uses her magically-infused locker to change into her school uniform, and then Grace takes her to her dorm room in order to get settled in. There, Blair meets her new roommates : Isla  and Hadley . She also meets their sprite assistants, Caprice and Harmony. After their brief introductions have been made, a sudden announcement is heard from Miss Privet, stating that every student is to now head over to the ""Starlight Welcome"" immediately, in order to receive their training crowns. At the welcome ceremony, Miss Privet explains that they will get real crowns once they have successfully completed the semester with high expectations. Another teacher of the school, Dame Devin, then announces that she will soon quit her job of instructing at the Princess Charm School after her daughter, Delancy  becomes the new princess of Gardania at the end of the semester. She goes on to explain that both she and her daughter have lived at the royal palace since the time of her sister-in-law, Queen Isabella, and her family's death within a car crash many years ago. Isla and Hadley, seated with the rest of their fellow students, then quietly discuss with Blair a well known legend which states that not everyone from the Royal Family had died. After the ceremony, each student has a curtsying class before dismissal for the evening, and Blair gets distracted by Hadley and Isla's continued tale and bumps into Delancy, who seems to have already developed quite a strong dislike for Blair, and openly expresses her disdain over the school's lottery system of allowing commoners to enroll. Isla and Hadley comfort Blair, telling her that they are positive that Blair can do anything Delancy can do. The next day, Blair's momentary confident instantly becomes unraveled upon witnessing Delancy being able to walk about with a very large stack of books on her head without any sort of difficulty during one of their lessons, when she, herself, can't even balance one. Many of the other girls, however, do have a few problems, themselves, but Dame Devin, the lesson's instructor, seems more keen upon singling Blair out the most. However, upon getting a better view of Blair's face, Dame Devin becomes immediately, and curiously shocked. She then ruthlessly tells her to get out of her class and states that she doesn't belong at such an establishment. Later on, at lunch, Delancy inspired by her mother's viciousness, makes her sprite assistant, Wickellia, secretly tuck a piece of tablecloth into Blair's skirt while she, Isla, and Hadley unknowingly continue on within their meals. As a result, Blair ends up being further embarrassed with herself when she unexpectedly drags each girl's trays clear off of the table upon standing. Back within their dorm room, Isla and Hadley try to cheer up Blair by telling her that Dame Devin, herself, was once a lottery winner, as well. However, none of the princesses at the time had selected her to be their Lady Royal, not even Queen Isabella. Afterwards, a knock upon their door is heard, and Hadley goes to open it, revealing a struggling Grace holding onto a large care package addressed to Blair, from her sister Emily. Inside are various letters and other items, including a drawing of a baby Blair being left on their mother's doorstep. Blair explains to her curious friends that she is adopted, and so too, is Emily, and that the drawing is in reference to a tale which is favorite of Emily's , in that Blair had suddenly been found upon their mother's doorstep when Blair was one-year-old. Miss Privet, who arrives at the girls' dorm room in order to tell Blair a bit of bad news regarding her continued enrollment, then stops herself from doing so upon unintentionally eavesdropping. The following day, this time at a ballroom dancing class, Blair continually manages to step onto the toes of Delancy's friend, Portia, who is Blair's dance partner. As a result, Blair is kept behind after class by Miss Privet, who had been the instructor. Now alone, she tells Blair that Dame Devin wanted her to be expelled, a desire which had almost been granted; however, Miss Privet admits to Blair that she is aware of her personal reasons for wanting to become a Lady Royal , and so decides to tutor her, herself. She goes on to explain to Blair that each lesson her students learn simply isn't for superficial reasons, but rather to instill a better sense of character and confidence within each of girl. Confidence without character can be a problem, just like, within Blair's case, character without confidence can be, as well, according to Miss Privet. She then stresses to Blair that no one can make her feel inferior without her consent. And so, with the now added assistance of Miss Privet, Blair gradually begins to improve within her areas of balance, grace, dancing and more over time.

Now alone, she tells Blair that Dame Devin wanted her to be expelled, a desire which had almost been granted; however, Miss Privet admits to Blair that she is aware of her personal reasons for wanting to become a Lady Royal , and so decides to tutor her, herself. She goes on to explain to Blair that each lesson her students learn simply isn't for superficial reasons, but rather to instill a better sense of character and confidence within each of girl. Confidence without character can be a problem, just like, within Blair's case, character without confidence can be, as well, according to Miss Privet. She then stresses to Blair that no one can make her feel inferior without her consent. And so, with the now added assistance of Miss Privet, Blair gradually begins to improve within her areas of balance, grace, dancing and more over time. As wintertime arrives, the charm school students are one day joined by the young men from the ""Prince Charming School""  for one of their dance classes. Blair inevitably gets partnered with a young prince-to-be named Nicholas, who appears to be every bit as down to earth and friendly as she. As a result, the two seem to hit it off, as they share various jokes with one another while dancing. Jealous, as she had been hoping to dance with Nicholas, herself, Delancy trips Blair in order to once again humiliate her; however, Nicholas helps Blair quickly recover, as the two lead the overall group  within an abrupt transition from traditional ballroom dancing, to something much more modern. before dancing like they're at a party. When they are done, the men leave, much to the regret of the women, but Miss Privet assures them that they will again return in order to attend the dual graduation ceremony, and coronation of Delancy as the princess of Gardania at the end of the semester. Springtime eventually arrives, and now with only two days before the ceremony, where both the princesses and Lady Royals will be crowned, Miss Privet announces that the girls will get to spend another one of their table manners classes within the palace this time. Blair, Hadley and Isla go with their sprites  to pamper themselves within the school spa as a preparatory treat, while Dame Devin secretly instructs Wickellia to rip up the girls' uniforms . Meanwhile, Isla and Hadley continue to tell Blair more legends about the Royal Family, including one about Gardania's magic crown, which lights up when put upon the head of the rightful heir to the throne. The girls head back to their room to find it in shambles, and their uniforms torn to shreds. As both Isla and Hadley lament over the fact that they cannot attend class without them on, and that missing any class will result within an automatic failure, Blair, having now grown a bit more confident over time, is then overcome with sudden determination. She refuses to let her or her friends fail, and so with the help of the sprites fashions some new, personalized uniforms using leftover fabric from the old ones. Having just made it to the palace in time, Blair, Isla, Hadley, and the rest of the students are awarded a bit of free time to explore the first floor before the start of class. While doing so, the trio mysteriously find a portrait of Blair, which actually turns out to be one of the then Princess Isabella, when she was eighteen-years-old, a year older than Blair. The girls then see a portrait of the entire Royal Family: Queen Isabella, her husband, King Reginald, a puppy which Blair is stunned to realize is actually Prince, the dog, and a young baby girl in the Queen's arms. Upon further inspection of the portrait, Hadley and Isla begin to surmise that perhaps Blair could be the baby from the picture, and proceed to ask her when exactly it was that her mother had found her as a baby. Blair reveals the date to be April 26th, a date which had also become her birthday when her mother find her on her doorstep, as she didn't know when Blair was actually born. Stunned, however now more convinced than ever that their suspicions are correct, both Isla and Hadley reveal to Blair that April 26th was the very same day that the Royal Family had perished within their car accident. They go on to say that they believe that perhaps Princess Sophia hadn't died with the King and Queen, after all, but rather had been found and left in front of somebody else's door to be raised. This hypothesis also makes them realize that this was the most probable reason why Dame Devin and Delancy have continually been so unfair to Blair, because she and Princess Sophia are one in the same and thus, is the rightful heir to the throne of Gardania. Unbeknownst to the trio, Delancy has eavesdropped upon the entire conversation, and promptly becomes disturbed by the news, as her mother had never told her these things. Later on at class, Dame Devin reveals to her students her intentions for Gardania  once her daughter is made princess: to bulldoze the beggared areas of the land and create parks in its stead, in order to make the overall kingdom more beautiful. Blair is shocked appalled by this, and informs her that her family lives there, but Dame Devin heartlessly remarks that she should then leave the school immediately in order to move her family to a new home in time, not at all caring that such an act would be impossible for them, as they have no money. Blair looks at Delancy, trying to talk to her to see sense, but Delancy remains silent, though she is herself worried about what her mother will do further when she is a princess. Blair runs away in her room, feeling utterly broken and defeated. She does do as Dame Devin had instructed and packs up her belongings in order to leave the school once and for all; however, upon gazing at her sister Emily's sent drawing once more, decides to stay and to finally fight back. Meeting back up with Hadley and Isla, Blair informs them that she intends to locate the magical crown so that she can use it to prove that she is the rightful heir, and thus successfully stop Dame Devin and Delancy's plans from coming to fruition. Her friends naturally volunteer to help, and so the trio then plan to go back to the palace later that night to search for it, before the graduation and coronation the following day. That evening, before the girls can leave, a fire alarm suddenly goes off. The students all go outside accordingly, while Dame Devin secretly places several pieces of her jewelery within Blair, Hadley and Isla's dorm room in order to implicate them and finally have them expelled. Delancy finds her leaving the room and becomes suspicious, but her mother quickly changes the subject by asking her why she suddenly has a customized uniform like Blair and her friends, to which Delancy coolly explains it's simply because she likes the way it looks. A little more than half an hour later, the students can finally go back into their rooms, but Blair, Isla and Hadley are abruptly stopped by a guard, Dame Devin, and Miss Privet. They are then accused of stealing Dame Devin's jewelery, about which they naturally dispute. However, upon searching their dorm room, the guard successfully locates each missing valuable. The girls are then to be detained until after the coronation ceremony; however, while the guard takes them away, Delancy suddenly approaches and stops him, claiming that she wishes to carry out their punishment, herself . At first hesitant to listen to her, the gevery student within attendance es and she hesitantly asks Blair if she truly is Princess Sophia, to which Blair responds that she believes she is. Delancy then quickly hands over a map of the palace basement where the magical crown can be located, further revealing to them that she is assisting their efforts because she wants to do what is right for the kingdom. Before parting ways, she also tells them she will leave a window open on the third floor of the palace for them to enter through, and then runs off back to her room, as her mother believes her to already be asleep. Blair, Hadley and Isla head back to the palace, and find Prince thankfully distracting another guard for them. They then use a rope from their bag to climb up to the third floor window, before then taking an elevator inside to the basement. Hadley notices devices on the walls within the room, and recognizes them as laser alarms, whose beams are invisible and will set off its detection if any are stepped through. And so Blair carefully blows a bit of makeup powder towards the lasers in order to make them become visible. Hadley, the most athletic of the three, utilizes some of her impressive gymnastics abilities in order to bypass the beams and make it to the other side, while both Blair and Isla make a far more slower trek across, with some help from Grace. Once there, there is a keypad which needs a password to unlock a vault door, most probably where the magical crown is being held, so they try the date of the coronation. It is incorrect, however, and so they use the password hint  to figure out the real password. They then try the date of the car crash and it works. Inside the room are several of Dame Devin's possessions. Blair and her friends find the magical crown, but Dame Devin finds them, and makes Brock, her guard, seize the crown from them. She then changes the password, with Isla memorizing the tune of the pressed buttons, and locks them inside of the vault. The girls are stuck within the vault for several hours, right up to when the coronation begins and Delancy becomes moments away from being officially crowned. Seeing that they have yet to arrive, she figures out how to stall the proceedings while Blair and her friends try to find a way to escape. Isla, meanwhile, keeps humming the tune of the keypad buttons, and Hadley, who had been attempting to pry open the vault doors with a sword she had found, accidentally knocks the cover off a nearby box of electrical wires. Seeing this and realizing that it is most likely connected to the vault's stored password, they wire up Blair's phone to the keypad to use her phone buttons to enter the password from inside of the room. Isla, having memorized the new password, she carefully hums out the tune before entering it onto the phone. Successful, they finally make their hurried escape. The girls arrive at the graduation ceremony just in time, and Blair confidently makes an open claim to the throne, stating that she is Princess Sophia. Emily and her mother, who are watching the action at the TV, gasped in shock. The royal judge, who crowns the princesses and Lady Royals, takes Blair seriously, but Dame Devin, now furious, tries to stop her. They begin to fight over the crown, before Delancy manages to catch it and then has to decide whether to give it to her mother or to Blair. In the end, she chose to give it to Blair, and when she puts it on, it immediately illuminates and transforms her appearance magically, to look more like a princess. Dame Devin, amidst her outrage, exclaims that she killed Queen Isabella just so that Delancy could be the princess, instead, and thus is arrested, while a disheartened Delancy watches on as she gets dragged away. At Miss Privet's prompting, Blair makes a quick, introductory speech, telling the people of Gardania that she is honored to be their princess. Miss Privet then tells her that now is the time when she must select a Lady Royal, and Blair, feeling sympathy for Delancy for helping her so much in this mission, chooses Delancy, who is delighted and then crowned. Later that evening, at the graduation party, everyone dances to Isla's one of her finally revealed songs, ""We Rule This School,"" which she also DJs for. Even Miss Privet dances along with her students, while the now Prince Nicholas arrives and meets up with Blair again. He states that he is unsure of whether to call her Blair or Princess Sophia, but she assures him that she wants to continue going by the name ""Blair."" The new Lady Royal, Delancy, then announces that the Princess has some special visitors, which are revealed to be Emily and her mother. Blair welcomes them to their ""new home"". Emily then asks Blair if, since Blair is now a princess, does that also make her one, as well. Blair warmly tells her: ""Of course; there's a princess in every girl,"" before stating that she wishes to introduce both she and their mother to everyone."

Upon returning home from a yet another long day of work at the ""Cafe Gardania,"" Emily, Blair's younger sister, is watching the annual ""Princess Procession"" on TV, which involves princesses from many other kingdoms coming to enroll at the original Princess Charm School  in order to learn their full potential. In addition, each semester one commoner is also allowed enrollment if she wins the ""lottery"" that awards her a full scholarship, as well as the chance to become a ""Lady Royal,"" a princess's most trusted advisor. Blair asks if their mom is okay as the two watch the television, and Emily tells her that the doctors have simply said that she was ""comfortable"". Blair wishes she were better, and also that Emily could grow up within a better neighborhood, as the family lives in the more destitute area of Gardania and have little money. Blair decides that she will continue to work hard for her family. On the TV, Blair, Emily and their mother, who later joins them, watch as the lottery winner is picked . . . Blair. Absolutely stunned by this, Blair then learns from her little sister that the reason her name had been drawn was due to the fact that Emily had secretly entered her Blair's name many times per day. Initially, Blair doesn't wish to leave her responsibilities to her family behind, but her mother, who sees it as a good opportunity for her daughter , manages to convince her. Blair parts ways with her family and leaves to go the school within a carriage driven by a man named Brock, who is an employee working there. At the school, Blair is greeted by a large Golden Retriever named Prince, which curiously takes an immediate shining to her. The Headmistress of the school, Alexandra Privet, finding Blair on the floor with Prince  then takes her to her locker, and explains things about the school along the way. Blair, at her locker, is suddenly met by a magical sprite named Grace. She turns out to be Blair's assigned, personal princess assistant, as every student within attendance at the charm school possesses, as well. Blair uses her magically-infused locker to change into her school uniform, and then Grace takes her to her dorm room in order to get settled in. There, Blair meets her new roommates : Isla  and Hadley . She also meets their sprite assistants, Caprice and Harmony. After their brief introductions have been made, a sudden announcement is heard from Miss Privet, stating that every student is to now head over to the ""Starlight Welcome"" immediately, in order to receive their training crowns. At the welcome ceremony, Miss Privet explains that they will get real crowns once they have successfully completed the semester with high expectations. Another teacher of the school, Dame Devin, then announces that she will soon quit her job of instructing at the Princess Charm School after her daughter, Delancy  becomes the new princess of Gardania at the end of the semester. She goes on to explain that both she and her daughter have lived at the royal palace since the time of her sister-in-law, Queen Isabella, and her family's death within a car crash many years ago. Isla and Hadley, seated with the rest of their fellow students, then quietly discuss with Blair a well known legend which states that not everyone from the Royal Family had died. After the ceremony, each student has a curtsying class before dismissal for the evening, and Blair gets distracted by Hadley and Isla's continued tale and bumps into Delancy, who seems to have already developed quite a strong dislike for Blair, and openly expresses her disdain over the school's lottery system of allowing commoners to enroll. Isla and Hadley comfort Blair, telling her that they are positive that Blair can do anything Delancy can do. The next day, Blair's momentary confident instantly becomes unraveled upon witnessing Delancy being able to walk about with a very large stack of books on her head without any sort of difficulty during one of their lessons, when she, herself, can't even balance one. Many of the other girls, however, do have a few problems, themselves, but Dame Devin, the lesson's instructor, seems more keen upon singling Blair out the most. However, upon getting a better view of Blair's face, Dame Devin becomes immediately, and curiously shocked. She then ruthlessly tells her to get out of her class and states that she doesn't belong at such an establishment. Later on, at lunch, Delancy inspired by her mother's viciousness, makes her sprite assistant, Wickellia, secretly tuck a piece of tablecloth into Blair's skirt while she, Isla, and Hadley unknowingly continue on within their meals. As a result, Blair ends up being further embarrassed with herself when she unexpectedly drags each girl's trays clear off of the table upon standing. Back within their dorm room, Isla and Hadley try to cheer up Blair by telling her that Dame Devin, herself, was once a lottery winner, as well. However, none of the princesses at the time had selected her to be their Lady Royal, not even Queen Isabella. Afterwards, a knock upon their door is heard, and Hadley goes to open it, revealing a struggling Grace holding onto a large care package addressed to Blair, from her sister Emily. Inside are various letters and other items, including a drawing of a baby Blair being left on their mother's doorstep. Blair explains to her curious friends that she is adopted, and so too, is Emily, and that the drawing is in reference to a tale which is favorite of Emily's , in that Blair had suddenly been found upon their mother's doorstep when Blair was one-year-old. Miss Privet, who arrives at the girls' dorm room in order to tell Blair a bit of bad news regarding her continued enrollment, then stops herself from doing so upon unintentionally eavesdropping.

Inside are various letters and other items, including a drawing of a baby Blair being left on their mother's doorstep. Blair explains to her curious friends that she is adopted, and so too, is Emily, and that the drawing is in reference to a tale which is favorite of Emily's , in that Blair had suddenly been found upon their mother's doorstep when Blair was one-year-old. Miss Privet, who arrives at the girls' dorm room in order to tell Blair a bit of bad news regarding her continued enrollment, then stops herself from doing so upon unintentionally eavesdropping. The following day, this time at a ballroom dancing class, Blair continually manages to step onto the toes of Delancy's friend, Portia, who is Blair's dance partner. As a result, Blair is kept behind after class by Miss Privet, who had been the instructor. Now alone, she tells Blair that Dame Devin wanted her to be expelled, a desire which had almost been granted; however, Miss Privet admits to Blair that she is aware of her personal reasons for wanting to become a Lady Royal , and so decides to tutor her, herself. She goes on to explain to Blair that each lesson her students learn simply isn't for superficial reasons, but rather to instill a better sense of character and confidence within each of girl. Confidence without character can be a problem, just like, within Blair's case, character without confidence can be, as well, according to Miss Privet. She then stresses to Blair that no one can make her feel inferior without her consent. And so, with the now added assistance of Miss Privet, Blair gradually begins to improve within her areas of balance, grace, dancing and more over time. As wintertime arrives, the charm school students are one day joined by the young men from the ""Prince Charming School""  for one of their dance classes. Blair inevitably gets partnered with a young prince-to-be named Nicholas, who appears to be every bit as down to earth and friendly as she. As a result, the two seem to hit it off, as they share various jokes with one another while dancing. Jealous, as she had been hoping to dance with Nicholas, herself, Delancy trips Blair in order to once again humiliate her; however, Nicholas helps Blair quickly recover, as the two lead the overall group  within an abrupt transition from traditional ballroom dancing, to something much more modern. before dancing like they're at a party. When they are done, the men leave, much to the regret of the women, but Miss Privet assures them that they will again return in order to attend the dual graduation ceremony, and coronation of Delancy as the princess of Gardania at the end of the semester. Springtime eventually arrives, and now with only two days before the ceremony, where both the princesses and Lady Royals will be crowned, Miss Privet announces that the girls will get to spend another one of their table manners classes within the palace this time. Blair, Hadley and Isla go with their sprites  to pamper themselves within the school spa as a preparatory treat, while Dame Devin secretly instructs Wickellia to rip up the girls' uniforms . Meanwhile, Isla and Hadley continue to tell Blair more legends about the Royal Family, including one about Gardania's magic crown, which lights up when put upon the head of the rightful heir to the throne. The girls head back to their room to find it in shambles, and their uniforms torn to shreds. As both Isla and Hadley lament over the fact that they cannot attend class without them on, and that missing any class will result within an automatic failure, Blair, having now grown a bit more confident over time, is then overcome with sudden determination. She refuses to let her or her friends fail, and so with the help of the sprites fashions some new, personalized uniforms using leftover fabric from the old ones. Having just made it to the palace in time, Blair, Isla, Hadley, and the rest of the students are awarded a bit of free time to explore the first floor before the start of class. While doing so, the trio mysteriously find a portrait of Blair, which actually turns out to be one of the then Princess Isabella, when she was eighteen-years-old, a year older than Blair. The girls then see a portrait of the entire Royal Family: Queen Isabella, her husband, King Reginald, a puppy which Blair is stunned to realize is actually Prince, the dog, and a young baby girl in the Queen's arms. Upon further inspection of the portrait, Hadley and Isla begin to surmise that perhaps Blair could be the baby from the picture, and proceed to ask her when exactly it was that her mother had found her as a baby. Blair reveals the date to be April 26th, a date which had also become her birthday when her mother find her on her doorstep, as she didn't know when Blair was actually born. Stunned, however now more convinced than ever that their suspicions are correct, both Isla and Hadley reveal to Blair that April 26th was the very same day that the Royal Family had perished within their car accident. They go on to say that they believe that perhaps Princess Sophia hadn't died with the King and Queen, after all, but rather had been found and left in front of somebody else's door to be raised. This hypothesis also makes them realize that this was the most probable reason why Dame Devin and Delancy have continually been so unfair to Blair, because she and Princess Sophia are one in the same and thus, is the rightful heir to the throne of Gardania. Unbeknownst to the trio, Delancy has eavesdropped upon the entire conversation, and promptly becomes disturbed by the news, as her mother had never told her these things. Later on at class, Dame Devin reveals to her students her intentions for Gardania  once her daughter is made princess: to bulldoze the beggared areas of the land and create parks in its stead, in order to make the overall kingdom more beautiful. Blair is shocked appalled by this, and informs her that her family lives there, but Dame Devin heartlessly remarks that she should then leave the school immediately in order to move her family to a new home in time, not at all caring that such an act would be impossible for them, as they have no money. Blair looks at Delancy, trying to talk to her to see sense, but Delancy remains silent, though she is herself worried about what her mother will do further when she is a princess. Blair runs away in her room, feeling utterly broken and defeated. She does do as Dame Devin had instructed and packs up her belongings in order to leave the school once and for all; however, upon gazing at her sister Emily's sent drawing once more, decides to stay and to finally fight back. Meeting back up with Hadley and Isla, Blair informs them that she intends to locate the magical crown so that she can use it to prove that she is the rightful heir, and thus successfully stop Dame Devin and Delancy's plans from coming to fruition. Her friends naturally volunteer to help, and so the trio then plan to go back to the palace later that night to search for it, before the graduation and coronation the following day. That evening, before the girls can leave, a fire alarm suddenly goes off. The students all go outside accordingly, while Dame Devin secretly places several pieces of her jewelery within Blair, Hadley and Isla's dorm room in order to implicate them and finally have them expelled. Delancy finds her leaving the room and becomes suspicious, but her mother quickly changes the subject by asking her why she suddenly has a customized uniform like Blair and her friends, to which Delancy coolly explains it's simply because she likes the way it looks. A little more than half an hour later, the students can finally go back into their rooms, but Blair, Isla and Hadley are abruptly stopped by a guard, Dame Devin, and Miss Privet. They are then accused of stealing Dame Devin's jewelery, about which they naturally dispute. However, upon searching their dorm room, the guard successfully locates each missing valuable. The girls are then to be detained until after the coronation ceremony; however, while the guard takes them away, Delancy suddenly approaches and stops him, claiming that she wishes to carry out their punishment, herself . At first hesitant to listen to her, the gevery student within attendance es and she hesitantly asks Blair if she truly is Princess Sophia, to which Blair responds that she believes she is. Delancy then quickly hands over a map of the palace basement where the magical crown can be located, further revealing to them that she is assisting their efforts because she wants to do what is right for the kingdom. Before parting ways, she also tells them she will leave a window open on the third floor of the palace for them to enter through, and then runs off back to her room, as her mother believes her to already be asleep. Blair, Hadley and Isla head back to the palace, and find Prince thankfully distracting another guard for them. They then use a rope from their bag to climb up to the third floor window, before then taking an elevator inside to the basement. Hadley notices devices on the walls within the room, and recognizes them as laser alarms, whose beams are invisible and will set off its detection if any are stepped through. And so Blair carefully blows a bit of makeup powder towards the lasers in order to make them become visible. Hadley, the most athletic of the three, utilizes some of her impressive gymnastics abilities in order to bypass the beams and make it to the other side, while both Blair and Isla make a far more slower trek across, with some help from Grace. Once there, there is a keypad which needs a password to unlock a vault door, most probably where the magical crown is being held, so they try the date of the coronation. It is incorrect, however, and so they use the password hint  to figure out the real password. They then try the date of the car crash and it works. Inside the room are several of Dame Devin's possessions. Blair and her friends find the magical crown, but Dame Devin finds them, and makes Brock, her guard, seize the crown from them. She then changes the password, with Isla memorizing the tune of the pressed buttons, and locks them inside of the vault. The girls are stuck within the vault for several hours, right up to when the coronation begins and Delancy becomes moments away from being officially crowned. Seeing that they have yet to arrive, she figures out how to stall the proceedings while Blair and her friends try to find a way to escape. Isla, meanwhile, keeps humming the tune of the keypad buttons, and Hadley, who had been attempting to pry open the vault doors with a sword she had found, accidentally knocks the cover off a nearby box of electrical wires. Seeing this and realizing that it is most likely connected to the vault's stored password, they wire up Blair's phone to the keypad to use her phone buttons to enter the password from inside of the room. Isla, having memorized the new password, she carefully hums out the tune before entering it onto the phone. Successful, they finally make their hurried escape. The girls arrive at the graduation ceremony just in time, and Blair confidently makes an open claim to the throne, stating that she is Princess Sophia. Emily and her mother, who are watching the action at the TV, gasped in shock. The royal judge, who crowns the princesses and Lady Royals, takes Blair seriously, but Dame Devin, now furious, tries to stop her. They begin to fight over the crown, before Delancy manages to catch it and then has to decide whether to give it to her mother or to Blair. In the end, she chose to give it to Blair, and when she puts it on, it immediately illuminates and transforms her appearance magically, to look more like a princess. Dame Devin, amidst her outrage, exclaims that she killed Queen Isabella just so that Delancy could be the princess, instead, and thus is arrested, while a disheartened Delancy watches on as she gets dragged away. At Miss Privet's prompting, Blair makes a quick, introductory speech, telling the people of Gardania that she is honored to be their princess. Miss Privet then tells her that now is the time when she must select a Lady Royal, and Blair, feeling sympathy for Delancy for helping her so much in this mission, chooses Delancy, who is delighted and then crowned. Later that evening, at the graduation party, everyone dances to Isla's one of her finally revealed songs, ""We Rule This School,"" which she also DJs for. Even Miss Privet dances along with her students, while the now Prince Nicholas arrives and meets up with Blair again. He states that he is unsure of whether to call her Blair or Princess Sophia, but she assures him that she wants to continue going by the name ""Blair."" The new Lady Royal, Delancy, then announces that the Princess has some special visitors, which are revealed to be Emily and her mother. Blair welcomes them to their ""new home"". Emily then asks Blair if, since Blair is now a princess, does that also make her one, as well. Blair warmly tells her: ""Of course; there's a princess in every girl,"" before stating that she wishes to introduce both she and their mother to everyone."

Upon returning home from a yet another long day of work at the ""Cafe Gardania,"" Emily, Blair's younger sister, is watching the annual ""Princess Procession"" on TV, which involves princesses from many other kingdoms coming to enroll at the original Princess Charm School  in order to learn their full potential. In addition, each semester one commoner is also allowed enrollment if she wins the ""lottery"" that awards her a full scholarship, as well as the chance to become a ""Lady Royal,"" a princess's most trusted advisor. Blair asks if their mom is okay as the two watch the television, and Emily tells her that the doctors have simply said that she was ""comfortable"". Blair wishes she were better, and also that Emily could grow up within a better neighborhood, as the family lives in the more destitute area of Gardania and have little money. Blair decides that she will continue to work hard for her family. On the TV, Blair, Emily and their mother, who later joins them, watch as the lottery winner is picked . . . Blair. Absolutely stunned by this, Blair then learns from her little sister that the reason her name had been drawn was due to the fact that Emily had secretly entered her Blair's name many times per day. Initially, Blair doesn't wish to leave her responsibilities to her family behind, but her mother, who sees it as a good opportunity for her daughter , manages to convince her. Blair parts ways with her family and leaves to go the school within a carriage driven by a man named Brock, who is an employee working there. At the school, Blair is greeted by a large Golden Retriever named Prince, which curiously takes an immediate shining to her. The Headmistress of the school, Alexandra Privet, finding Blair on the floor with Prince  then takes her to her locker, and explains things about the school along the way. Blair, at her locker, is suddenly met by a magical sprite named Grace. She turns out to be Blair's assigned, personal princess assistant, as every student within attendance at the charm school possesses, as well. Blair uses her magically-infused locker to change into her school uniform, and then Grace takes her to her dorm room in order to get settled in. There, Blair meets her new roommates : Isla  and Hadley . She also meets their sprite assistants, Caprice and Harmony. After their brief introductions have been made, a sudden announcement is heard from Miss Privet, stating that every student is to now head over to the ""Starlight Welcome"" immediately, in order to receive their training crowns. At the welcome ceremony, Miss Privet explains that they will get real crowns once they have successfully completed the semester with high expectations. Another teacher of the school, Dame Devin, then announces that she will soon quit her job of instructing at the Princess Charm School after her daughter, Delancy  becomes the new princess of Gardania at the end of the semester. She goes on to explain that both she and her daughter have lived at the royal palace since the time of her sister-in-law, Queen Isabella, and her family's death within a car crash many years ago. Isla and Hadley, seated with the rest of their fellow students, then quietly discuss with Blair a well known legend which states that not everyone from the Royal Family had died. After the ceremony, each student has a curtsying class before dismissal for the evening, and Blair gets distracted by Hadley and Isla's continued tale and bumps into Delancy, who seems to have already developed quite a strong dislike for Blair, and openly expresses her disdain over the school's lottery system of allowing commoners to enroll. Isla and Hadley comfort Blair, telling her that they are positive that Blair can do anything Delancy can do. The next day, Blair's momentary confident instantly becomes unraveled upon witnessing Delancy being able to walk about with a very large stack of books on her head without any sort of difficulty during one of their lessons, when she, herself, can't even balance one. Many of the other girls, however, do have a few problems, themselves, but Dame Devin, the lesson's instructor, seems more keen upon singling Blair out the most. However, upon getting a better view of Blair's face, Dame Devin becomes immediately, and curiously shocked. She then ruthlessly tells her to get out of her class and states that she doesn't belong at such an establishment. Later on, at lunch, Delancy inspired by her mother's viciousness, makes her sprite assistant, Wickellia, secretly tuck a piece of tablecloth into Blair's skirt while she, Isla, and Hadley unknowingly continue on within their meals. As a result, Blair ends up being further embarrassed with herself when she unexpectedly drags each girl's trays clear off of the table upon standing. Back within their dorm room, Isla and Hadley try to cheer up Blair by telling her that Dame Devin, herself, was once a lottery winner, as well. However, none of the princesses at the time had selected her to be their Lady Royal, not even Queen Isabella.

She then ruthlessly tells her to get out of her class and states that she doesn't belong at such an establishment. Later on, at lunch, Delancy inspired by her mother's viciousness, makes her sprite assistant, Wickellia, secretly tuck a piece of tablecloth into Blair's skirt while she, Isla, and Hadley unknowingly continue on within their meals. As a result, Blair ends up being further embarrassed with herself when she unexpectedly drags each girl's trays clear off of the table upon standing. Back within their dorm room, Isla and Hadley try to cheer up Blair by telling her that Dame Devin, herself, was once a lottery winner, as well. However, none of the princesses at the time had selected her to be their Lady Royal, not even Queen Isabella. Afterwards, a knock upon their door is heard, and Hadley goes to open it, revealing a struggling Grace holding onto a large care package addressed to Blair, from her sister Emily. Inside are various letters and other items, including a drawing of a baby Blair being left on their mother's doorstep. Blair explains to her curious friends that she is adopted, and so too, is Emily, and that the drawing is in reference to a tale which is favorite of Emily's , in that Blair had suddenly been found upon their mother's doorstep when Blair was one-year-old. Miss Privet, who arrives at the girls' dorm room in order to tell Blair a bit of bad news regarding her continued enrollment, then stops herself from doing so upon unintentionally eavesdropping. The following day, this time at a ballroom dancing class, Blair continually manages to step onto the toes of Delancy's friend, Portia, who is Blair's dance partner. As a result, Blair is kept behind after class by Miss Privet, who had been the instructor. Now alone, she tells Blair that Dame Devin wanted her to be expelled, a desire which had almost been granted; however, Miss Privet admits to Blair that she is aware of her personal reasons for wanting to become a Lady Royal , and so decides to tutor her, herself. She goes on to explain to Blair that each lesson her students learn simply isn't for superficial reasons, but rather to instill a better sense of character and confidence within each of girl. Confidence without character can be a problem, just like, within Blair's case, character without confidence can be, as well, according to Miss Privet. She then stresses to Blair that no one can make her feel inferior without her consent. And so, with the now added assistance of Miss Privet, Blair gradually begins to improve within her areas of balance, grace, dancing and more over time. As wintertime arrives, the charm school students are one day joined by the young men from the ""Prince Charming School""  for one of their dance classes. Blair inevitably gets partnered with a young prince-to-be named Nicholas, who appears to be every bit as down to earth and friendly as she. As a result, the two seem to hit it off, as they share various jokes with one another while dancing. Jealous, as she had been hoping to dance with Nicholas, herself, Delancy trips Blair in order to once again humiliate her; however, Nicholas helps Blair quickly recover, as the two lead the overall group  within an abrupt transition from traditional ballroom dancing, to something much more modern. before dancing like they're at a party. When they are done, the men leave, much to the regret of the women, but Miss Privet assures them that they will again return in order to attend the dual graduation ceremony, and coronation of Delancy as the princess of Gardania at the end of the semester. Springtime eventually arrives, and now with only two days before the ceremony, where both the princesses and Lady Royals will be crowned, Miss Privet announces that the girls will get to spend another one of their table manners classes within the palace this time. Blair, Hadley and Isla go with their sprites  to pamper themselves within the school spa as a preparatory treat, while Dame Devin secretly instructs Wickellia to rip up the girls' uniforms . Meanwhile, Isla and Hadley continue to tell Blair more legends about the Royal Family, including one about Gardania's magic crown, which lights up when put upon the head of the rightful heir to the throne. The girls head back to their room to find it in shambles, and their uniforms torn to shreds. As both Isla and Hadley lament over the fact that they cannot attend class without them on, and that missing any class will result within an automatic failure, Blair, having now grown a bit more confident over time, is then overcome with sudden determination. She refuses to let her or her friends fail, and so with the help of the sprites fashions some new, personalized uniforms using leftover fabric from the old ones. Having just made it to the palace in time, Blair, Isla, Hadley, and the rest of the students are awarded a bit of free time to explore the first floor before the start of class. While doing so, the trio mysteriously find a portrait of Blair, which actually turns out to be one of the then Princess Isabella, when she was eighteen-years-old, a year older than Blair. The girls then see a portrait of the entire Royal Family: Queen Isabella, her husband, King Reginald, a puppy which Blair is stunned to realize is actually Prince, the dog, and a young baby girl in the Queen's arms. Upon further inspection of the portrait, Hadley and Isla begin to surmise that perhaps Blair could be the baby from the picture, and proceed to ask her when exactly it was that her mother had found her as a baby. Blair reveals the date to be April 26th, a date which had also become her birthday when her mother find her on her doorstep, as she didn't know when Blair was actually born. Stunned, however now more convinced than ever that their suspicions are correct, both Isla and Hadley reveal to Blair that April 26th was the very same day that the Royal Family had perished within their car accident. They go on to say that they believe that perhaps Princess Sophia hadn't died with the King and Queen, after all, but rather had been found and left in front of somebody else's door to be raised. This hypothesis also makes them realize that this was the most probable reason why Dame Devin and Delancy have continually been so unfair to Blair, because she and Princess Sophia are one in the same and thus, is the rightful heir to the throne of Gardania. Unbeknownst to the trio, Delancy has eavesdropped upon the entire conversation, and promptly becomes disturbed by the news, as her mother had never told her these things. Later on at class, Dame Devin reveals to her students her intentions for Gardania  once her daughter is made princess: to bulldoze the beggared areas of the land and create parks in its stead, in order to make the overall kingdom more beautiful. Blair is shocked appalled by this, and informs her that her family lives there, but Dame Devin heartlessly remarks that she should then leave the school immediately in order to move her family to a new home in time, not at all caring that such an act would be impossible for them, as they have no money. Blair looks at Delancy, trying to talk to her to see sense, but Delancy remains silent, though she is herself worried about what her mother will do further when she is a princess. Blair runs away in her room, feeling utterly broken and defeated. She does do as Dame Devin had instructed and packs up her belongings in order to leave the school once and for all; however, upon gazing at her sister Emily's sent drawing once more, decides to stay and to finally fight back. Meeting back up with Hadley and Isla, Blair informs them that she intends to locate the magical crown so that she can use it to prove that she is the rightful heir, and thus successfully stop Dame Devin and Delancy's plans from coming to fruition. Her friends naturally volunteer to help, and so the trio then plan to go back to the palace later that night to search for it, before the graduation and coronation the following day. That evening, before the girls can leave, a fire alarm suddenly goes off. The students all go outside accordingly, while Dame Devin secretly places several pieces of her jewelery within Blair, Hadley and Isla's dorm room in order to implicate them and finally have them expelled. Delancy finds her leaving the room and becomes suspicious, but her mother quickly changes the subject by asking her why she suddenly has a customized uniform like Blair and her friends, to which Delancy coolly explains it's simply because she likes the way it looks. A little more than half an hour later, the students can finally go back into their rooms, but Blair, Isla and Hadley are abruptly stopped by a guard, Dame Devin, and Miss Privet. They are then accused of stealing Dame Devin's jewelery, about which they naturally dispute. However, upon searching their dorm room, the guard successfully locates each missing valuable. The girls are then to be detained until after the coronation ceremony; however, while the guard takes them away, Delancy suddenly approaches and stops him, claiming that she wishes to carry out their punishment, herself . At first hesitant to listen to her, the gevery student within attendance es and she hesitantly asks Blair if she truly is Princess Sophia, to which Blair responds that she believes she is. Delancy then quickly hands over a map of the palace basement where the magical crown can be located, further revealing to them that she is assisting their efforts because she wants to do what is right for the kingdom. Before parting ways, she also tells them she will leave a window open on the third floor of the palace for them to enter through, and then runs off back to her room, as her mother believes her to already be asleep. Blair, Hadley and Isla head back to the palace, and find Prince thankfully distracting another guard for them. They then use a rope from their bag to climb up to the third floor window, before then taking an elevator inside to the basement. Hadley notices devices on the walls within the room, and recognizes them as laser alarms, whose beams are invisible and will set off its detection if any are stepped through. And so Blair carefully blows a bit of makeup powder towards the lasers in order to make them become visible. Hadley, the most athletic of the three, utilizes some of her impressive gymnastics abilities in order to bypass the beams and make it to the other side, while both Blair and Isla make a far more slower trek across, with some help from Grace. Once there, there is a keypad which needs a password to unlock a vault door, most probably where the magical crown is being held, so they try the date of the coronation. It is incorrect, however, and so they use the password hint  to figure out the real password. They then try the date of the car crash and it works. Inside the room are several of Dame Devin's possessions. Blair and her friends find the magical crown, but Dame Devin finds them, and makes Brock, her guard, seize the crown from them. She then changes the password, with Isla memorizing the tune of the pressed buttons, and locks them inside of the vault. The girls are stuck within the vault for several hours, right up to when the coronation begins and Delancy becomes moments away from being officially crowned. Seeing that they have yet to arrive, she figures out how to stall the proceedings while Blair and her friends try to find a way to escape. Isla, meanwhile, keeps humming the tune of the keypad buttons, and Hadley, who had been attempting to pry open the vault doors with a sword she had found, accidentally knocks the cover off a nearby box of electrical wires. Seeing this and realizing that it is most likely connected to the vault's stored password, they wire up Blair's phone to the keypad to use her phone buttons to enter the password from inside of the room. Isla, having memorized the new password, she carefully hums out the tune before entering it onto the phone. Successful, they finally make their hurried escape. The girls arrive at the graduation ceremony just in time, and Blair confidently makes an open claim to the throne, stating that she is Princess Sophia. Emily and her mother, who are watching the action at the TV, gasped in shock. The royal judge, who crowns the princesses and Lady Royals, takes Blair seriously, but Dame Devin, now furious, tries to stop her. They begin to fight over the crown, before Delancy manages to catch it and then has to decide whether to give it to her mother or to Blair. In the end, she chose to give it to Blair, and when she puts it on, it immediately illuminates and transforms her appearance magically, to look more like a princess. Dame Devin, amidst her outrage, exclaims that she killed Queen Isabella just so that Delancy could be the princess, instead, and thus is arrested, while a disheartened Delancy watches on as she gets dragged away. At Miss Privet's prompting, Blair makes a quick, introductory speech, telling the people of Gardania that she is honored to be their princess. Miss Privet then tells her that now is the time when she must select a Lady Royal, and Blair, feeling sympathy for Delancy for helping her so much in this mission, chooses Delancy, who is delighted and then crowned. Later that evening, at the graduation party, everyone dances to Isla's one of her finally revealed songs, ""We Rule This School,"" which she also DJs for. Even Miss Privet dances along with her students, while the now Prince Nicholas arrives and meets up with Blair again. He states that he is unsure of whether to call her Blair or Princess Sophia, but she assures him that she wants to continue going by the name ""Blair."" The new Lady Royal, Delancy, then announces that the Princess has some special visitors, which are revealed to be Emily and her mother. Blair welcomes them to their ""new home"". Emily then asks Blair if, since Blair is now a princess, does that also make her one, as well. Blair warmly tells her: ""Of course; there's a princess in every girl,"" before stating that she wishes to introduce both she and their mother to everyone."

Upon returning home from a yet another long day of work at the ""Cafe Gardania,"" Emily, Blair's younger sister, is watching the annual ""Princess Procession"" on TV, which involves princesses from many other kingdoms coming to enroll at the original Princess Charm School  in order to learn their full potential. In addition, each semester one commoner is also allowed enrollment if she wins the ""lottery"" that awards her a full scholarship, as well as the chance to become a ""Lady Royal,"" a princess's most trusted advisor. Blair asks if their mom is okay as the two watch the television, and Emily tells her that the doctors have simply said that she was ""comfortable"". Blair wishes she were better, and also that Emily could grow up within a better neighborhood, as the family lives in the more destitute area of Gardania and have little money. Blair decides that she will continue to work hard for her family. On the TV, Blair, Emily and their mother, who later joins them, watch as the lottery winner is picked . . . Blair. Absolutely stunned by this, Blair then learns from her little sister that the reason her name had been drawn was due to the fact that Emily had secretly entered her Blair's name many times per day. Initially, Blair doesn't wish to leave her responsibilities to her family behind, but her mother, who sees it as a good opportunity for her daughter , manages to convince her. Blair parts ways with her family and leaves to go the school within a carriage driven by a man named Brock, who is an employee working there. At the school, Blair is greeted by a large Golden Retriever named Prince, which curiously takes an immediate shining to her. The Headmistress of the school, Alexandra Privet, finding Blair on the floor with Prince  then takes her to her locker, and explains things about the school along the way. Blair, at her locker, is suddenly met by a magical sprite named Grace. She turns out to be Blair's assigned, personal princess assistant, as every student within attendance at the charm school possesses, as well. Blair uses her magically-infused locker to change into her school uniform, and then Grace takes her to her dorm room in order to get settled in. There, Blair meets her new roommates : Isla  and Hadley . She also meets their sprite assistants, Caprice and Harmony. After their brief introductions have been made, a sudden announcement is heard from Miss Privet, stating that every student is to now head over to the ""Starlight Welcome"" immediately, in order to receive their training crowns. At the welcome ceremony, Miss Privet explains that they will get real crowns once they have successfully completed the semester with high expectations. Another teacher of the school, Dame Devin, then announces that she will soon quit her job of instructing at the Princess Charm School after her daughter, Delancy  becomes the new princess of Gardania at the end of the semester. She goes on to explain that both she and her daughter have lived at the royal palace since the time of her sister-in-law, Queen Isabella, and her family's death within a car crash many years ago. Isla and Hadley, seated with the rest of their fellow students, then quietly discuss with Blair a well known legend which states that not everyone from the Royal Family had died. After the ceremony, each student has a curtsying class before dismissal for the evening, and Blair gets distracted by Hadley and Isla's continued tale and bumps into Delancy, who seems to have already developed quite a strong dislike for Blair, and openly expresses her disdain over the school's lottery system of allowing commoners to enroll. Isla and Hadley comfort Blair, telling her that they are positive that Blair can do anything Delancy can do. The next day, Blair's momentary confident instantly becomes unraveled upon witnessing Delancy being able to walk about with a very large stack of books on her head without any sort of difficulty during one of their lessons, when she, herself, can't even balance one. Many of the other girls, however, do have a few problems, themselves, but Dame Devin, the lesson's instructor, seems more keen upon singling Blair out the most. However, upon getting a better view of Blair's face, Dame Devin becomes immediately, and curiously shocked.

In a drunken stupor Viren lands up at Bhatti's doorstep demanding his money back, while Mini's engagement is in progress. An argument ensues and Viren lays his hands on a pistol. Viren tells Bhatti that he is going to count to 3 or he is going to shoot him. Viren counts to three but misses because he was drunk. The cause of the sound made a distraction, and Mini and Viren escape. In the commotion, Mini seizes the opportunity of cancelling her marriage and forces Viren to kidnap her and makes him drive them off in the waiting vehicle. The spunky Mini makes a deal with Viren that he will follow her instructions and will demand a ransom of Rs 10 lakh  from her father. He can then have his Rs 60,000 and she will keep the rest as she does not want to go back home and get married. While the ransom letter goes to Mini's father, the couple enter into someone's home and try to make ends meet. In the process, they fall in love and are happy being with each other. The story takes a twist when Mini's fiance Sunny along with her father comes to pay the ransom amount but actually fools them and starts firing, hoping to take Mini back. Suddenly, Mini and Viren are kidnapped by another person and taken away to the Chowdhary's haveli. Chowdhary  is a notorious kidnapping kingpin, who makes a living out of demanding ransom. Just when you think Chowdhary is a villain of sorts and some never-ending torture drama will unfold, we discover that Viren alias ""Chotu"" is Chowdhary's son. Disapproving of his father's ways, Viren has left home six years ago to work in Patiala as a rickshaw driver. The story unfolds and leads to a dramatic climax involving a shiny horse and a beautiful car! Mini's father comes to take her, Mini is very sad to go back home and Viren also tells her to go. Mini's marriage day comes, Viren has a conversation with his father and after that he and Mini are married. Mini finally realizes that she is married to Viren and they both live happily."

The movie begins with Molly  waiting in an emergency room. There is a television news broadcast about a missing girl. After being told by the physician that she has heartburn and to ""lay off the spliffs"", she's off riding her bike to her art class where she is drawing a nude woman. Luke  is walking down the school hall to meet up with Molly to go squat. Both walking to their vehicle, they meet up with Toby  and Zoe , all packing the van to go searching for a vacant home to squat. While driving, they all discuss the legality of squating and what they will be doing while squating. When they arrive at their first destination, they quickly discover the residence is too secured and decide to drive around to find a new place. They drive up to a huge abandoned home, break in, and quickly make themselves at home. Trying to turn on the water valve, Toby and Zoe have a quick sex scene. Toby bumps into a wardrobe and a few pieces of clothing fall out. As Zoe dances around the room with a hat from the wardrobe, Molly and Luke quickly recognize there is blood on the clothes. Everyone is then freaked out and want to leave. Toby suggests sleeping the night and leaving in the morning. Everyone agrees. After walking up, they discover they are locked inside the house and the tools they used to break in are now missing. They discover their phones are also missing and there is no possible way out of the house. They quickly come to the conclusion they are not alone and begin exploring the house. They discover a dank room with four empty chairs lined up. Going back to the room they slept in the night before, they notice a tiny hole in the boarded window. They begin yelling for help when they see a patrol officer in front of the house looking at their parked van. A door in the room quickly slams shut and a gas begins to seep through the threshold and knocks all four of them out. Once they awake, Toby is missing and the remaining three frantically start looking for him. While looking, Zoe cuts her leg. The films cuts to Toby sitting in one of the four chairs in the dank room and a rubber gloved hand covers his mouth. Back to the remaining three, Molly asks Zoe to show her where she cut her leg. She brings them to a metal locker. Luke and Molly move the locker and a horrible smell is omitted from a huge hole in the wall. Luke stands in front of the hole and although we do not see him enter the whole in the wall, we are to assume he did as we get a glimpse of a few teeth in a wall pipe. The film cuts back to Toby as he is now tied to a metal bed/cot and he is thrashing in attempts to break free. A man in a hazmat type suit and a surgical mask quickly enters the room and gives him a sedative that knocks him out. The film cuts back to the remaining three. Zoe starts to verbally assault Luke and asks him what he saw, that he looked shaken up by what he saw. Luke claims he saw nothing, then confesses he saw mutilated body parts. Zoe and Molly are disturbed. As Molly and Luke are talking, Zoe walks back to the hole in the wall and peeks inside. As Luke and Molly realize Zoe is not in the room with them, they rush to the whole in the wall just as Zoe is being dragged in by the man in the hazmat suit. As Molly and Luke are now in a new room , Luke tells Molly not to look around as it is gorey. The film cuts to Zoe tied to a cot/metal bed. She can see the man in a hazmat suit cut out Toby's eye and put it in a jar. The man then walks to Zoe. As she pleads for her life, she asks why is he doing his. He mumbles, ""for my father"". He exams Zoe's cut leg, leaves the room, and then returns with a hack saw. The film cuts back to Molly and Luke as they find a key in the wall to the fuse box. As Luke opens the box and stats turning on lights, the lights in the room with the man and Zoe start to flicker. Annoyed by this, the man leaves Zoe to deal with Molly and Luke. Luke is hiding behind a door when he sees the hazmat suited man walk past slowly. Luke and Molly attack the man violently with planks only to find that the hazmat suited man tricked them and put Toby in the suit. Toby quickly dies and the old man appears behind Molly and Luke with the sleepIng gas. As Molly tries to drag herself away, Luke is dragged off into a room. Molly passes out. The film cuts back to the doctor returning to Zoe, who has almost freed herself. He slaps her across the face and begins to quickly cut her leg off. Molly awakes and is in the dank room with four chairs from the beginning. She sees the old man looking at her through a room but does not try to escape. She leaves the room and returns to the room where they spent the first night. She begins removing two stair railings and starts to break the stairs from underneath. She is then in a room eating an ice cube when the old man comes in and knocks her out. When she awakes, she is tied to a gurney. The man is about to cut her chest when he realizes he has no water in his bowl. Going upstairs to get water, the stairs Molly previously began destroying is starting to give way. The man returns without incident and attempts to cut Molly's chest. He hears a noise upstairs and goes to check it out, leaving the scalpel on the gurney. Molly grabs the scalpel and begins to cut herself free. As the man comes down the stairs, he falls through the sabotaged steps, Molly grabs a wooden object and hits him in the head, knocking him out. She grabs his keys and begins running through the house trying to get free. Entering a room, she sees Luke with a plastic sheet covering him. The old man awakes and begins to get free from the stairs. Molly runs into what looks like the living quarters and finds a door out with a few locks. Fumbling for the right key, she cannot get the locks openned quick enough before the old man is in the same area she's in. She hides behind a door while the man looks around for her. She sees a few newspaper articles about how a father was beaten in front of his son, and a few identification cards showing the old man was or is a surgeon. The man enters the same room Molly is in, but she has already snuck out and returned to the door to unlock it. The old man is standing in front of an urn  when he hears the jingle of the keys Molly is using to try and get free. The man quickly approaches Molly and attacks her. The movie goes silent, but the movie is showing her struggle with the man as he drags her though the house and throws her in a dark room. The sound returns as Molly is locked in the room with the only light is a TV that is knocked down and showing only static. She hears a sound and starts to see that there is another person in the room with her. It is the girl from the missing persons broadcast from the beginning of the movie , but she is clearly exhibiting animal instincts. The girl attacks Molly and the movie ends."

Nate is a recognized artist, Emily a fashion designer and the two are expecting their first child. Emily suffers a terrible miscarriage during a dinner party and she is informed that the scarring left on her womb means that she will never be able to conceive again. To give them both a fresh start, Nate and Emily move out into the countryside to Nate's family home which has been uninhabited for some time. At first enchanted by it, Emily is horrified when a skeleton is discovered during an inspection of the house plumbing but it is obvious that the body is very old so no danger can be attached to the house. Nate decides to use the large outdoor shed as a studio while Emily takes one of the old bedrooms as her workshop. After Emily discovers an old trunk filled with baby things in the cellar she pays a visit to the local Historical Society and is told that the house has a past she and Nate were unaware of. Several suspicious deaths have occurred at the property and a female relative of Nate's vanished without trace when the house was new. Nate grows distant as he starts painting again and he refuses to let Emily see his new work. Tense and isolated, Emily starts to see visions of a woman covered with blood and faints. After seeing the doctor, who thinks she is suffering from trauma, she gets a phone call to tell her that she is actually pregnant. Ordered to spend the bulk of her pregnancy in bed resting due to the high risk of miscarriage, Emily starts to get bored and frustrated by Nate who is working longer and longer hours and seems uninterested in her or the coming baby. Emily's visions continue and she thinks that she can see the missing aunt of Nate's walking about the property. Organising a party so she can see her city friends, she believes that Nate's agent is having an affair with her husband. Soon afterwards the agent somehow falls through the window in Emily's studio and is hospitalised. Nate thinks Emily may have pushed her as he saw her in the rom after the woman fell and tells Emily's best friend that he is concerned for Emily's health. When the couple receive a call to tell them that the agent has died, Nate storms out. Emily reads through a folder of press cuttings left by the historical society and discovers that all the women who died at the house were killed by their husbands. She has another vision of the dead woman and believes that Nate is coming back to kill her. She calls her best friend who tells her that she will come and pick her up. Terrified, Emily hides in her bedroom with a knife when she hears Nate come back into the house. She tries to stab him with the knife but instead stabs her friend- who had driven back with Nate. She and Nate then fight resulting in Emily killing Nate. At the hospital a scan reveals that Emily is not pregnant although she believes that she is- the phone call from the doctor and the visions were all in her head, a symptom of psychosis. Emily is left in a padded room, rocking her imaginary child in her arms.

The narrator focuses on the emotional qualities of the objects, and discusses the perception of African sculptures from a historical and contemporary European perspective. Only occasionally does the film provide the geographical origin, time period or other contextual information about the objects. The idea of a dead statue is explained as a statue which has lost its original significance and become reduced to a museum object, similarly to a dead person who can be found in history books. Interweaved with the objects are a few scenes of Africans performing traditional music and dances, as well as the death of a disemboweled gorilla. During the last third of the film, the modern commercialisation of African culture is problematised. The film argues that colonial presence has compelled African art to lose much of its idiosyncratic expression, in order to appeal to Western consumers. A mention is made of how African currencies previously had been replaced by European. In the final segment, the film comments on the position of black Africans themselves in contemporary Europe and North America. Footage is seen from a Harlem Globetrotters basketball show, of the boxer Sugar Ray Robinson, and a jazz drummer intercut with scenes from a confrontation between police and labour demonstrators.

Gertrud Habersaat is a maid in the house of the Leßtorffs, the richest farmers in Rakowen, a village in Mecklenburg. She is pregnant with Jürgen Leßtorff's baby, and hopes he will marry her. But after returning from the war in Poland, he forsakes her in favor of Countess Palvner and joins Hans Frank's staff in the newly-formed General Government. Gertrud is forced to have an abortion and to marry Emil Kalluweit, a landless worker. Willi Heyer, a communist recently released from prison who was on probation in Rakowen, escapes to join the underground.   Kalluweit is given a farm in Poland, where he and his wife are to be part of the new 'Master Race'. They witness the brutal deportation of the local Poles. Gertrud saves a little girl, Mala, who is harassed by SS men and adopts her. Heyer, who is now imprisoned in a concentration camp, saves Polish professor Pinarski from the AB Action; they escape the camp. When Gertrud discovers that Mala is Jewish, she finds Leßtorff and convinces him to arrange fake papers for her; he agrees, on condition that she takes in another child, Stefan. Kalluweit volunteers to join the Wehrmacht after SS officer Schneider wants to draft him to his organization.  In 1945, Gertrud and the children flee the Red Army. She returns to Rakowen, where Heyer is appointed mayor by the Soviet authorities. Leßtorff returns, after hiding his wartime activities from his British captors. Heyer confiscates the rich farmers' cows to provide milk for the starving children of the refugees. When Heyer leaves to meet the Soviet commandant, the wealthy villagers seize power again. Schneider, who hides in Leßtorff's farm, threatens Gertrud not to reveal his identity. She leaves the village, but the returning Heyer convinces her to stay. He confronts the villagers and wins them over. Gertrud exposes Schneider, who kills Jürgen while trying to escape. Countess Palvner, who owned most of the village's land, is deported and her possessions are re-distributed to her former serfs.  The need to modernize and to maximize production leads most of the villagers to agree to the formation of an agricultural cooperative. Gertrud resists the plans to hand over her land, but Heyer convinces her to accept it, and she eventually becomes the chairperson of the new cooperative.  Emil Kalluweit, now a rich West German businessman, returns to the village and tries to convince Gertrud to leave with him. Stefan's mother is revealed to be alive, and visits her son, who is torn between her and his German upbringing. Gertrud decides to remain in Rakowen, starting a new life with Heyer.

Upon entering the town pub he sees the silhouettes of a group of men, one of whom is holding a gun. Believing he is witnessing a murder he rushes into the next room, where he sees that the men are trying to put down an apparently sick dog. Unable to bring themselves to carry out the euthanasia, the men, with Thomas, retreat to the bar. Publican Jack Collins  tells him the dog's name is Red Dog and narrates his story. Upon arriving in Dampier, the dog befriends many of the employees of Hamersley Iron, who have a major iron ore excavation in progress. Various miners relate their stories of Red Dog to Thomas, but state that, while Red Dog was a dog for everyone, he had no real master. The men then tell of an American named John Grant , who becomes Red's true master. John, a bus driver for Hamersley Iron, starts dating a woman named Nancy , who is a secretary at Hamersley Iron. After living in Dampier for two years, John proposes to Nancy. On the night of the engagement, John tells Red Dog to stay until he returns from Nancy's caravan. Early the next morning, John rides his motorcycle from Nancy's caravan, but is killed in an accident on the way home. In the shock of John's accident, Nancy and the Hamersley men forget about Red Dog. Three days after the funeral, they find him still waiting where John told him to stay. After three weeks Red decides to look for John, first at Hamersley Iron, then the bar and other places where John was known to go, until all of Dampier is explored. He then continues across much of the Australian North West Pilbara region from Perth to Darwin. He is even rumoured to have caught a ship to Japan in search of John. Finally, the grief catches up to him, and he decides to return to Dampier. When he arrives, he returns to Nancy at the caravan park where she is staying, and she is overwhelmed to see him. The caretakers of the caravan park, however, do not allow dogs in the park, and threaten to shoot Red Dog. Nancy and John's friends at Hamersley then travel to the community of Dampier in support of Red Dog and, after a ""civilised chat"" with some of the miners, the caretaker and his wife leave, leaving their cat, Red Cat, behind. A great fight between Red Dog and Red Cat ensues, and in the end, they resolve their differences and become mates. Back in the present day, miner Jocko  asks the gathered crowd why they should have a statue of a man  set in their town when all he did in relation to the place was say that there were too many flies, and suggests that they should instead erect a statue of someone who represents the town – Red Dog. During the celebrations that follow, Red Dog gets up and walks out of the bar, unnoticed by everyone. Upon realising that the sick dog has left, everyone in the town begins looking for him, eventually finding him lying dead in front of John's grave. One year later, Thomas once again drives up to Dampier with a new puppy, a new Red Dog and the whole town unveils a statue of Red Dog, a statue which still stands today."

Sylvester suddenly hears a howl that scares him and Porky proceeds to point out it is a harmless coyote, forcing to go to sleep outside while Porky himself sleeps in his tent. Suddenly, an alien from the planet Jupiter arrives on Earth, with his mission being to collect some earthlings for an experiment. Sylvester is scared by the alien and tries to warn Porky, but this only makes Porky angry and causing him to boot Sylvester back outside. Eventually, Sylvester manages to show Porky of the alien who has arrived in their tent, but Porky mistakes the alien for a Navajo Native American and tells him to go back in his 'wigwum', on the supposed pretense he will look at his goods in the morning.

He then makes up a story about owning a little cat who'd cry when he was all alone and screams a loud ""MEOW!"" at the suitcase causing the dog to leap out. Realizing his cover's been blown, Pluto ducks back into the suitcase, but Pete has already figured it out. Before he can catch the pair, Mickey and Pluto run away and a chase ensues on board the train. Mickey and Pluto first hide in a sleeping car where Pete mistakenly intrudes on a female passenger and gets assaulted. Pete then stumbles into another bed where Mickey and Pluto  are hiding. Pete apologizes for the intrusion, but quickly catches on after realizing he was covering up Pluto's tail. Just as Mickey and Pluto are gloating that they'd fooled Pete, Pete bursts in and threatens to beat them to a pulp, but the sudden darkness  allows the pair to escape, leaving Pete to beat the mattress to a pulp . Mickey and Pluto masquerade as a conductor by hiding in Pete's own coat and hat which they'd had taken off in the tunnel. After getting false directions from Mickey, Pete catches on and threatens to catch them, but only ends up disturbing the female passenger again. Pete receives another beating and, unintentionally taking the passenger's hat, gets pricked by one of her needles. Finally Mickey disguises himself as an Indian chief with Pluto as his papoose, but Pete eventually sees through their disguises right after Pluto bites his hand. While Mickey and Pluto are next to an open window, Pluto is caught on a passing mail hook which whisks him outside the train. Mickey runs after him through the train, and is just barely able to grab Pluto as he exits the last car. Pete throws their luggage out after them and they fall to the ground from the mail hook. Mickey looks up at the station sign and is pleasantly surprised that they have already arrived at their destination &ndash; Pomona."

Mickey, at this point, decides to smuggle Pluto onboard by squeezing the dog inside his suitcase. At first, the handle breaks, making Mickey almost leave Pluto behind, but Mickey recovers the suitcase and manages to make it aboard just as the train is clearing the platform. Later, Pluto barks, wanting to be let out. Mickey scolds him for nearly arousing Pete, but manages to take Pluto out and unsquash Pluto.

Cindy, who works in the town's local museum and Jim, who is employed at the town's historic pencil factory, reside in the drought-stricken town of Stanleyville, North Carolina. The Greens are informed by doctors that they are unable to conceive. Distraught by the news, Jim convinces Cindy to dream up their ideal child and write the child's characteristics and life events on slips of notepad paper. The couple places the notes inside a box and bury it in their backyard garden. After a thunderstorm, which seemingly affects only their property, a ten year-old arrives at their home, claiming the Greens as his parents. After finding the box they buried smashed to pieces around a large hole in the ground where they originally buried it and finding the boy inside their house, covered in mud, they realize that the boy, named Timothy, is actually a culmination of all their wishes of what their child would be. The Greens also discover that Timothy has a startling feature; he has leaves growing on his legs.

Then one day his mother noticed that he wasn't playing with the other bulls. His mom asked him why he wasn't butting his head with the other bulls. He replied that all he wanted to do was to sit and smell the flowers. Luckily, his mother was very understanding. Over the years, Ferdinand grew and grew until he was as big as the tree. The other bulls wanted to accomplish one goal in life: to be in the bullfights in Madrid, Spain, but not Ferdinand. Then one day, five strange looking men were here to see the bulls. When the bulls noticed them, they fought as rough as possible, hoping that they would get picked, but not Ferdinand who went back to smell the flowers. Just as Ferdinand was sitting, he accidentally sat on a bumblebee. That made him go crazy and on a rampage, knocking the other bulls out and crashed into a tree, making it fall down. The five men cheered as they took Ferdinand to Madrid. There was a lot of excitement when the day of the bull fight came. On posters, they called him Ferdinand the Fierce. At the ring came out picadors and the matador who was being cheered on. When he was bowing, a woman in the audience gave him a bouquet of flowers which landed in his hand. Then the moment came where Ferdinand came out. He was wondering what was he doing there. The picadors were scared and hid, but the matador was scared stiff as Ferdinand noticed the bouquet of flowers. He was coming as the matador dropped the bouquet of flowers as Ferdinand smelled the flowers. The matador was angry that he wasn't charging at him. Then he was so angry that he cried because he didn't do anything and ripped his shirt. Ferdinand noticed that he had a flower tattoo with the word ""Daisy"" at the bottom. Ferdinand licked the tattoo as he kept on crying. Eventually, he was dragged out of the arena smelling the flowers and was taken back home. Then he went back under the tree and just smelled the flowers."

Meanwhile, an animator chooses to carry on with his work. In his drawing, he sketched a dungeon scene where Beans the Cat encounters a goblin. Weary for working several hours continuously, the animator decides to take a little snooze. Before ending the session, he draws a steel barricade between the two characters. Suddenly, the goblin comes to life and pulls him into the drawing. The goblin carries the animator away, heading somewhere beyond the picture's scene. Shocked and terrified, the animator tries in vain to break out of the goblin's grasp. He was then brought into a mystic chamber where stone portraits of various monsters are displayed on the walls. The monsters happened to be the animator's creations as well as those of his colleagues. They too came too life and got out of their illustrations. As revenge for how he and other cartoonists made them get subdued in the end of each film, the monsters gave the animator a pencil and forced him to draw a deep pit in the floor where they tossed him inside. Upon falling in, the animator holds onto a branch, trying to avoid being devoured by the crocodile at the bottom. Back at the scene still being worked on, Beans still stands behind the barricade, boredly waiting for his artist to come back. Just then, Little Kitty came to him, offering a lunchbox. Beans was expecting food but was a little surprised to find a saw in the container. Nonetheless, he uses it to cut his way out of the metal fence. Finally freeing himself, he goes around to find his animator. In no time, Beans found the chamber where his animator is being tormented. To intervene, he hurls a boot at the goblin, luring the monsters away as they try capture him. Beans managed to lose them somehow when he returns to the place to rescue the troubled man. The animator then receives a pencil from Beans and draws a ladder to climb out the pit. When the monsters are coming back, Beans spills lubricant between the room's entrance and the pit. The monsters slide on the lubricant mess and fall into the hole. To vanquish them for good, the animator removes the hole with an eraser. Beans and the animator shook hands for a work well done. It turns out what the animator went through was merely a dream as he was awaken by the custodian. To his relief, he finds the drawing on his desk unchanged. Not wanting to recall his experience, the animator edits out the goblin and the steel barricade, leaving only Beans in the picture. As a compliment to his little friend, he draws a platter with gelatin on top for Beans to eat.

That person then goes to the cellar of a Mansion called Dia Mansion, writes all that he has done on a letter, places it in a huge coffin-like box, and then shoots himself. The next part of the film opens in modern day UK, where the protagonist Dr. Kabir Malhotra  is shown living happily with his wife Sia . One day she goes missing without even a word. The worried doctor searches for her everywhere and questions everyone including her best friend Monica  but does not find anything, until he comes across Disha, a musician and sooth sayer with special powers of premonition on touching objects who does that job for free. Initially Kabir insults her and rejects her, but later on being convinced by inspector Asif Sheikh about her authentic powers, he agrees to take her help. With Sia gone, Kabir reflects on everything in the past- how he found Sia, how he had fought with other men at bars who went near her, how they had a good time. Soon Disha and the police find that Sia had gone with Monica and somebody else in a car somewhere, and that car is found abandoned. Kabir and Disha go to Monica's house, only to find that she has been murdered. The case takes an interesting turn when Disha happens to visualize something about Sia, whch she does not tell Kabir because of her fear that it would be too shocking for him to accept. Soon Kabir and his parents get a call that Sia has been kidnapped, and the kidnapper asks for 1 million pounds from Kabir's parents. The kidnappers ask Kabir to come alone to deliver the money through directions given to him time and again over phone. Kabir goes with transmitters fitted on him and the police tracking him, but these measures are rendered useless by the apparently smart criminals. Soon Kabir finds himself in a dance bar, where the bags are taken from him, but the criminals find that it is filled with only paper, and they beat him and threaten to kill his wife. Kabir chases them, only to be stopped by Disha who arrives at the scene. She tells him that she knows where his wife is. Disha takes Kabir and the cops to Dia Mansion, where on searching they come across the cellar and the coffin box. Kabir opens it to find a skeleton and a worn out parchment. He reads all that was on it, and understand that this was written by none other than himself centuries ago. Kabir had at that time been deceived by a jealous friend of his into believing that his wife was unfaithful, and he murdered his wife and kept her in the coffin box. Later on knowing the truth, he was not able to forgive himself, so he had approached a guru, who told him that he will pay for his crimes now and in the next life, and told him what to do next. Kabir had then written everything and had shot himself at the cellar. Soon the kidnappers send a disc to Kabir's family with a video of Sia being tortured as a warning not to call police, and this time Kabir is called to an isolated ship to pay up and take his wife. On reaching the ship, Kabir goes alone, but Disha sees a gang of goons following him, senses danger and follows him secretly. On the deck, Kabir meets with the greatest shock of his life when he sees his wife, hale and hearty waiting to meet him, with none other that her Englishman boyfriend, whom Kabir had once beaten in a bar for going to Sia. Apparently everything that has taken place has been an act and both have been involved in the entire drama. Sia shoots Kabir in the shoulder. She then tells him that she and the Englishman were lovers, and that her only interest in Kabir was in his father's money an property, for which she married him. She also admits that it was she who killed Monica as the latter was involved in the crime and knew all about it.

After discovering his Aunt has been hiding packages addressed to him, he sneaks down to the mailbox one morning and finds an envelope containing an iPhone, which transports him to Lunar Park in Sydney, Australia. He's met by Mr. Pentangle , an imposing Aboriginal man, who reveals that Ben is part of an ancient magical sect of Wittertainers. The pair journey to a small island off the Australian coast, which is home to Fairport Academy, the magic school that Ben will be attending. While moving into his dorm, Ben meets Scarlett McKenna , a gorgeous co-ed a few years his senior, who casts a spell curing his near-sightedness. At the school assembly, Ben is ignored by the student population, but Scarlett comforts him. The new principal, Bavarian filmmaker Werner Herzog , gives the opening address, warning the students that changes will be made with him in charge. A musical montage shows the next three months Ben's school life. His initial classes with Professor Mumblecore as a disaster, and Ben is the subject of humiliating gossip among his fellow students. He takes advantage of a history project to deliver a presentation on his idol, skiffle legend Johnny Leroy, which wins over his classmates, who applaud him enthusiastically. A chat between Ben and Scarlett shows their relationship beginning to grow closer, as Ben's confidence has grown. He is outfitted with a new wardrobe, and is given a suit belonging to his father as a going away present from Pentangle, who is swimming to Germany to take up his new post as headmaster of Werner Herzog's Rogue Film School. Ben visits Principal Herzog, curious about the history of his family. Herzog tells Ben of his early life, fighting along Ben's father Percy , a secret agent employed by the British government. Percy's career was focused on defeating the machinations of the sinister Lord Emmerich, a vicious mastermind with the head of a gorilla. In flasback, we see Ben's mother Lucy  held hostage by Lord Emmerich in his lair, inside a hollowed out Icelandic volcano. Percy breaks into the facility and confronts Emmerich, defeating him and rescuing his bride. Sensing his defeat, Emmerich sets the self-destruct sequence, causing the volcano to erupt and kill them all. Ben relates his troubles to Scarlett over a game of billiards in the Fairport Academy bar. She reveals she lusted after Ben's father when she was growing up, and they trade innuendo as she beats him decisively. As they get more and more drunk, she delivers a rambling speech to him about hero worship and they almost kiss. The next morning, Ben invites Scarlett down to the disused concert hall, and shows her his plan to resurrect the school's tradition of concerts, which used to be filled by the ghosts of dead rock stars. Ben's strategy is to run school talent quests, then start to bring in notable living performers, like Bruce Springsteen. An impressed Scarlett joins Ben on the stage and they perform a duet of the Fairport Academy School Song. The print becomes scratchy and is replaced by a technical difficulties card. The projectionist  phones the director of the film  and explains that he's lost the next two reels of the film. Dylan is concerned that this skips a number of important plot points, but they conclude that no one will notice. Kenneth restarts the projector. Elvis Costello and Paul McCartney have just left the stage as Ben concludes his performance at the school talent quest to rapturous applause. Later, Ben sleeps uneasily. Ben dreams he's back in the concert hall, watching Johnny Leroy and the Impulsives perform on stage. In the second verse, Leroy transforms into the Lord Emmerich, who leaps down from the stage and menaces Ben, demanding to know the 'secret of the cauldron of penguins'. Ben awakes with a start. Scarlett comes to his door to check on him, but Ben assures her it was merely a bad dream. A concerned Scarlett calls Pentangle in Germany and relays the news. Ben is plagued by another dream involving Lord Emmerich and the Cauldron of Penguins, this time more violent, and awakes in a panic. Scarlett comes to his door again, more concerned, and they sit together in his room and resolve to go to Principal Herzog for advice. She comforts him and they have sex. In his office the next morning, Herzog tells Ben of his concern that Emmerich is using Ben's dreams as a way to regain a footing in the physical world. The only solution is to keep Ben awake indefinitely and Herzog concocts a mixture of energy drinks, coffee and cocaine that Ben reluctantly drinks. He heads to the school library with the mixture, researching penguins in hopes of discovering the solution to the mystery of the cauldron. As he ingests more the mixture and stays awake longer, he begins hallucinating a talking stuffed penguin , who mocks him. Ben punches him repeatedly in the face. Two weeks later, a concerned Pentangle arrives at the library, searching for Ben, who has become totally unhinged. Pentangle cleans him up and tells him that Scarlett and Herzog have been kidnapped by Lord Emmerich, and together they search for clues where they were last seen. Ben finds an iPhone and uses the transporter app to follow them. He appears in Lord Emmerich's hollowed out Icelandic volcano lair, an exact replica of the room where he faced off with Ben's parents. Scarlett is bound and gagged on an operating table and Emmerich stands over her, threatening them with a pistol. He removes his gorilla mask to reveal that he is really Werner Herzog, who created the fictional persona of an eccentric Bavarian filmmaker to escape the authorities after surviving the destruction of his old lair. He reveals his overly elaborate plan in a long-winded speech, then prepares to shoot them both dead. Ben, remembering the layout from the earlier flashback sequence, activates the self-destruct sequence and transports him and Scarlett to safety

With little money and no prospects, Frankie is just about to move back home when she meets Stanley Benson  at a diner where Frankie has been washing dishes. Stanley asks Frankie out for dinner and a movie and convinces her to stay in Manhattan and take some classes at the local community college. Frankie tells Stanley that she is broke, and he suggests a way she can earn some extra money. She doesn't like the tone of Stanley's voice, but she is broke and has little choice, so she follows Stanley to his friend Johnny Pearson's place . Johnny calls himself a manager, but Frankie immediately knows he is truly a pimp. He offers her an opportunity to earn some money and even gives her a room she can live in. Frankie wants to tell him where to go, but she is broke so she moves in to Johnny's apartment building and begins sleeping with men, for money, during the nights, and working with Johnny's mother, Mrs. Pearson  during the day in the family's bakery, which is nothing more than a cover business for tax purposes.

Of the teachers, professor Mahanta  showed special interest in her. But Radha was more impressed by professor Naren Dutta , a shy, introvert man by nature and with strong ethical principle. As the result, rumour was spread in the village of Radha having affair with both the Professors. Radha got involved in the village affairs, and she influenced Rajat to think the course of action logically. Radha and Rajat joined the mission of smashing up country liquor joints and also questioned on the morality of Jamuna Hazarika in running licenced liquor outlet. Radha, along with Rajat, took initiative and exposed all wrong doings of Hazarika and his son Muhidhar in their process of construction of the dam. Finally, the monsoon downpour dropped in. Unabated heavy shower for days did the same to the villagers what they have been witnessing since ages. The dam constructed by Hazarika proved to be a farce because Muhidhar and his unholy nexus cut the base of the dam in the darkness of the downpour night. The entire area became submerged with water. The flood relief distribution team of the college led by professor Mahanta enjoyed the mission with joy and fun like having a picnic. Radha, disturbed, annoyed and tormented mentally, while standing on the bank of the devastating river, recalls the words of her most admired professor Naren Dutta : ""You’ve suffered, I’ve suffered. Only we have to struggle for our own dignity, we’ve got to fight."""

After a night playing together, James's grandmother becomes suspicious of her grandson and begins to spy on him, particularly after she starts to see him acting in mysterious ways. Finally, the Grandmother begins to take up the floorboards and discovers her missing things, notably the artifacts from her dollhouse. The Clock family escape to the sewers, where Pod  berates his daughter for having 'spoken to, let alone been seen by a human bean'. The Clock family travel down the sewers and emerge in a city of other little people like themselves, much to Arrietty's dismay, as she had been brought to believe that their family was the only one of their kind. Meanwhile, Professor Mildeye , a professor at a London university, is specialising in the subject of Homo sapiens redactus  but is dismissed by his colleagues as a fantasist. He befriends James's grandmother when she begins to ask him questions about little people, having found out about him online. The Clock family start to explore their new world. Arrietty, with a new urban fashion sense, is nearly run over by Spiller , a biker-type leader. After a confrontation with her, Homily Clock  turns up and makes him apologise, much to Arrietty's annoyance. When it turns out that Arrietty's father has chosen him to guide them to a new place to live, they strike up a friendship of sorts. Professor Mildeye arrives at James's house, determined to find the Clock family in order to examine them dead or alive. James, feigning disbelief at the existence of little people, becomes wary as these events develop. Arrietty then starts playing with the snowflakes as Pod and Homily have a talk about her ""mistake"". After explaining what snow is to Arriety, and after giving her a heated heart-to-heart about the protected life she's had, Arrietty storms off in anger, but activates a trap set out to capture them by Professor Mildeye. Pod and Homily push her out of the way but become trapped themselves. Pod tells Spiller to take care of Arriety and they escape as Pod and Homily are captured and brought to Mildeye's laboratory. Spiller tries to explain that he tried everything to save Pod and Homily, but Arrietty is determined to and save them. Spiller is shocked and says she will be killed, but they depart on hostile terms. In Professor Mildeye's laboratory, Pod thinks about how to escape, but is happy that his daughter is safe. Professor Mildeye leaves a message on the Hellman family's answer phone explaining to James's grandmother that he has captured Pod and Homily. James intercepts it, and listens in horror before deleting it and rushing off to the university. Meanwhile, Arrietty ventures above ground and is nearly killed by a street cleaning vehicle, but is rescued by Spiller who has reappeared. They head off to a church and hide in the Nativity scene while they work out what to do next. Spiller explains that Pod is a hero in the little world, as he saved their community from the human beans, but he failed to save a little girl, as he was faced with a terrible choice: Arrietty's cousin Eggletina or the entire community. Spiller adds that no-one blamed him for her death, but Pod blamed himself and exiled himself to the Hellman's house to live away from the little people community. Spiller agrees to help Arrietty save her parents. They head back to James Hellman's house, as she is sure he can help them. Pod and Homily attempt to escape but are captured by Mildeye as they hide behind a table leg. As he recaptures them, he discovers they can talk. James arrives at the university, feigning surprise that the Professor was right and the Borrowers do exist. Back home, the grandmother takes a bunch of flowers from the postman which are from Mildeye, who has become infatuated with her. James's dad arrives home with a model aircraft which is a Christmas present for James. James explains to Arrietty and Spiller that Homily and Pod are still alive. Spiller tries to attack James, but Arrietty explains that he's trustworthy. They watch a news clip from BBC News of the anchorman explaining Mildeye's theory, and that there would be a scientific conference the following day. The following morning, James heads to the university with the model aircraft which he found hidden under his late mum's bed, as Mildeye prepares for the conference. Spiller and Arrietty get inside the aircraft, and James launches it  and flies them above the university building from where, after an intimate moment during which the couple nearly kiss, they are dropped onto the building by makeshift parachutes. They make their way through the air conditioning system to a vent above the glass that Pod and Homily are being kept in. Meanwhile, James goes inside the university and distracts Mildeye that there are whole communities of little people living underground. Mildeye calls his assistant out of the lab, giving Arrietty and Spiller a chance to rescue Pod and Homily. At first, Homily is shocked to find Pod smiling, laughing and looking upwards as his daughter and Spiller are rescuing them using string and a paperclip. Mildeye being in the corridor talking to his assistant about James's revelation gives James a chance to open the air conditioning vent in the Professor's office to put a modified remote control car inside for the Borrowers to use as an escape vehicle. James leaves Mildeye's office, and gives Mildeye a board marker. The Professor and his assistant rush back to the office to find that James has drawn silly faces on magazine cut-outs of Mildeye which are hung on the wall. Mildeye realises that his ""specimens"" are in danger and rushes back to the lab, gaining entry just as Pod is being lifted up towards the air vent. As Mildeye tries to grab him, Spiller attaches himself to the other end of the string and jumps down through the vent, causing Pod to shoot up into it. Spiller, now in the lab, quickly escapes Mildeye and his assistant. The Clock family escape as Arrietty drives the modified remote control car through the air vents, while Mildeye chases the sound of the car through the corridors below. They leave the air conditioning system and drive through the corridors as Mildeye chases them. They make it into a lift in the nick of time, while Mildeye rushes down the stairs. As the lift opens, Arrietty drives the car full speed down a corridor and out over a balcony to the reception area below where James is waiting with a rucksack to catch them. Mildeye arrives at the balcony to see James running away. When they are safely back home, the Clock family and James watch the conference online to see if Mildeye has caught Spiller. When it appears that he has, Mildeye reveals a doll's jacket, much to the mirth of the crowds of press and scientists. They all leave the lecture theatre, leaving Mildeye raging, desperate and humiliated. As James closes the laptop, Spiller appears behind it announcing, ""Did you really think they'd catch me?"" Arrietty finally admits she likes him, to which Spiller says that the only reason he rescued them was to have the gold coin. James picks up the coin, which turns out to be the missing rare coin that his Grandmother was asking about. James puts the coin on the floor of his mum's bedroom, where his Grandmother later finds it. It turns out that the coin is incredibly valuable, and James and his father sell it to raise money for their house and for Christmas. James's dad is puzzled as to why all of the strawberry cream chocolates are missing from a chocolate tin — earlier in the film, we see Pod 'borrowing' them. Under the floorboards, the Clocks and Spiller have their own Christmas, and Pod and Homily reveal to Arrietty that they're ready to allow her to leave the confines of their underfloor home to go wherever she wants. She is overjoyed, and decides she wants to head back to the Borrower city with Spiller. Outside, James and the Clocks say goodbye to Arrietty, and Arrietty and Spiller slide down the drainpipe and the film ends with a still of Arrietty shooting out of the pipe in mid-air. In the post credits, the Grandmother is seen slipping a strawberry cream chocolate down the hole to the Clocks' home, and whispering ""Merry Christmas""."

Doris' father, bank president Maxwell , embezzled $25,000 to support the drilling project. Doris and Gene's fight heats up after he shoots out the tires on her car and she steals his horse, Champion. In an attempt to discredit Gene, Doris, who runs a radio station above Sing Low's cafe, broadcasts him on a program sponsored by the oil company. When Gene discovers the trick, he sets out in a rage to find her. George Wilkins , who is in charge of the oil well drilling, takes Doris to the drilling site and tell her the well is dry and he needs additional funds from her father to bring the well in. Doris doesn't know that Wilkins is actually trying to swindle her father by getting him to pay for all of the equipment while he stalls the drilling. Wilkins intends to take over the lease on the profitable land when the bank's lease runs out. While taking the payroll to the drilling site, Wilkins and Doris are held up by two thieves, who are actually Wilkins' henchmen. Gene comes to the rescue and grudingly returns the money to Doris, who continues on to the drilling site. Wilkins reprimands his men for getting caught and then lets them go. Doris and Gene return to the bank, where they discover Maxwell has tried to commit suicide after receiving a letter notifying him that the bank examiner would be arriving soon. Protecting Maxwell from embezzlement charges, Gene makes it seem as if Maxwell was shot during a robbery. Sometime later, Gene learns that the railroad will go through the town if the oil comes in, and he informs Wilkins that he will publicly support the drilling. Not wanting any public attention on his operation, Wilkins orders his men to hold Gene captive until after the lease is transferred to him. Gene escapes and alerts the townspeople to Wilkins' crooked dealings. Wilkins spreads a rumor that Gene intentionally swindled his friends by making them buy worthless oil stock, and later tells a crowd that Gene was behind the bank robbery. A mob gathers and goes after Gene who is forced to flee. At the oil well, Gene finds Sam Brown, an oil worker who was shot by Wilkins after he discovered that the well only needed to be dynamited to come in. After getting a doctor to treat Sam, Gene and Frog Millhouse  dynamite the well, despite the opposition from Wilkins and the crowd. Following the blast, the well comes in and soon the oil company, now called the Maxwell-Autry company, is prospering.

Gena and Katie, who wanted to have a big party, run off to do cocaine. At the dinner, Katie tells Gena she got a stripper for them that night. We are introduced to Trevor  who is the best man, and Gena sees her ex-boyfriend Clyde ([[Adam Scott  while Joe , a former classmate of the girls, talks to Katie. Trevor is telling an embarrassing story for his toast and Becky's cousins do a rap for her. Gena stands up to give her toast, revealing that they met in their high school bathroom, and Becky was forcing herself to throw up. Katie steps in, and since they are both high it doesn’t turn out well. Later on in the hotel suite, a stripper, Katie's co-worker, shows up for all the women. Becky is into it until she hears him call her Pigface, which was her mean nickname in high school. Gena acts like it’s funny and Becky yells at her her, telling her and Katie not to come to the wedding unless they are sober. Regan, Gena, and Katie are left in the hotel room drinking and snorting coke. Regan can’t get over the fact that Becky is getting married before her. Katie tries on Becky’s wedding dress which is too big for them. She and Regan both get in the dress and Gena goes to take their picture, and the dress rips. They freak out and bring the dress down to the hotel housekeeper, but they can’t do anything. Meanwhile, Regan is on the phone with her boyfriend Frank who can no longer attend the wedding because he's busy with medical school. They discover that Katie’s nose is bleeding on the dress. In the hallway of the hotel, they run into Dale and his groomsmen, and he is blindfolded on his way to a strip club. They part ways but not before Gena pretends to come on to Clyde, stealing his wallet to try and help pay for the dress to get fixed. The men are in a limo on their way to the strip club talking about women and dating. Meanwhile, the women are standing outside the bridal shop waiting for the store owner, vowing they will never do coke again. The owner, Melissa shows up and is hostile to the girls, especially Regan, for making her open the store for them in the middle of the night. They lie and tell her that Becky decided she wants a new dress. Regan refuses to buy the dress Melissa finds because it’s “her perfect dress.” She says she’d rather lick the sidewalk than have Becky wear it, and then she actually does lick the sidewalk. During this, they discover that Katie knows how to sew. They buy thread and now need to find a sewing machine. Meanwhile, Trevor keeps texting Regan to go to the strip club. At the strip club, Dale goes to wait in the car when finding out Becky's friends are coming. The three ladies show up and aren’t allowed in the strip club without a male escort so Dale gets them in. They go inside to clean off the dress. Trevor asks Regan to help Joe hook up with Katie, and they wind up in a history discussion. Clyde is trying to hook up with the stripper and realizes that his wallet is missing. As Gena tries to clean the dress in the bathroom, she starts talking to a stripper who uses the dress as a towel and toilet paper without her noticing. Afterwards, Regan yells at Gena for trying to confess to Becky over the phone. The girls begin arguing, and Regan yells at Gena saying she handles everything, including Gena's abortion. Gena gets Clyde, and they leave together with the dress. Trevor gets Joe to take Katie home and tells him to have sex with her, which he doesn't want to do because she's heavily intoxicated. Gena and Clyde argue on the subway since she stole his wallet and she is still mad about what happened between them. In high school, Gena got pregnant and she had to get an abortion without his help. Meanwhile, Trevor and Regan wind up having sex in the hotel bar bathroom. Becky calls her and asks her to come up to her room. Clyde and Gena go to his mother’s house who agrees to fix the dress. Clyde makes pancakes while Gena tries to call a cocaine dealer. He throws her phone outside telling her it’s not cute anymore. They wind up looking at old photos and he tells her that he couldn’t show up that day because he was too sad. They go into his bedroom where he plays her a mixtape he made when they were in high school and they end up having sex. Joe and Katie go off on their own and go swimming in an indoor pool at the hotel. They share stories about partying, and she tells him that she slit her wrist a year ago. He kisses her, and they get out of the pool. They’re going to have sex, but Joe tells her that he likes her a lot and cares how they have sex. He doesn’t want a random, drunken hook up with her. However, Katie can’t even remember his name. He leaves, both of them upset. Regan goes to Becky’s room. Becky feels bad about what happened earlier. She thanks Regan for everything she’s done and Regan sneaks off to the bathroom and leaves another message for Gena on her phone. Becky opens the door and catches Regan about to make herself throw up. They reminisce about high school and how Becky took the fall for Regan's bulimia. Regan is about to tell Becky about the dress when Becky’s mother shows up and tells them that it’s time for her to start getting ready. Gena and Clyde wake up. She grabs the dress and runs out. The party planners try to find the dress, confused as to where it could be. Joe tells Regan that Katie locked herself in the bathroom and won’t come out. Gena has the fixed dress and brings it back to the tailor in the hotel saying it’s fixed and asks her to clean it. She finally calls back Regan and tells her the dress needs 40 minutes. Regan finds Katie in the bathroom, and she seemingly having OD’d. Joe realizes that Katie took the Xanax that Trevor gave him at the strip club and calls the paramedics. Regan sticks her fingers down Katie’s throat and has her throw up the pills, getting some vomit on Regan's dress. Regan tells a nervous Becky that her dress is being steamed. Gena knocks on Trevor’s door and hits him with a coffeepot for giving Joe the Xanax. She then runs after Regan and Becky with the dress but misses them. She uses the same cab as Clyde who tells her that they are meant to be together. Becky screams at her mother and Regan in the taxi saying she hates both of them. They get to the wedding, and Becky is still screaming at Regan. Gena shows up with the dress and Becky notices the blood stain. She gets over it and walks down the aisle, leaving Gena and Regan, who has vomit on her, behind. Katie gets there late and the three of them sit on a bench watching the ceremony. At the reception, Joe and Katie talk and kiss, Regan tries to sleep, and Clyde gives an obscene speech about having sex with Gena the night before. He says he wants to do that forever and starts to sing I'm Gonna Be to her after which they kiss. The four girls dance together as the film closes."

Gena and Katie, who wanted to have a big party, run off to do cocaine. At the dinner, Katie tells Gena she got a stripper for them that night. We are introduced to Trevor  who is the best man, and Gena sees her ex-boyfriend Clyde ([[Adam Scott  while Joe , a former classmate of the girls, talks to Katie. Trevor is telling an embarrassing story for his toast and Becky's cousins do a rap for her. Gena stands up to give her toast, revealing that they met in their high school bathroom, and Becky was forcing herself to throw up. Katie steps in, and since they are both high it doesn’t turn out well. Later on in the hotel suite, a stripper, Katie's co-worker, shows up for all the women. Becky is into it until she hears him call her Pigface, which was her mean nickname in high school. Gena acts like it’s funny and Becky yells at her her, telling her and Katie not to come to the wedding unless they are sober. Regan, Gena, and Katie are left in the hotel room drinking and snorting coke. Regan can’t get over the fact that Becky is getting married before her. Katie tries on Becky’s wedding dress which is too big for them. She and Regan both get in the dress and Gena goes to take their picture, and the dress rips. They freak out and bring the dress down to the hotel housekeeper, but they can’t do anything. Meanwhile, Regan is on the phone with her boyfriend Frank who can no longer attend the wedding because he's busy with medical school. They discover that Katie’s nose is bleeding on the dress. In the hallway of the hotel, they run into Dale and his groomsmen, and he is blindfolded on his way to a strip club. They part ways but not before Gena pretends to come on to Clyde, stealing his wallet to try and help pay for the dress to get fixed. The men are in a limo on their way to the strip club talking about women and dating. Meanwhile, the women are standing outside the bridal shop waiting for the store owner, vowing they will never do coke again. The owner, Melissa shows up and is hostile to the girls, especially Regan, for making her open the store for them in the middle of the night. They lie and tell her that Becky decided she wants a new dress. Regan refuses to buy the dress Melissa finds because it’s “her perfect dress.” She says she’d rather lick the sidewalk than have Becky wear it, and then she actually does lick the sidewalk. During this, they discover that Katie knows how to sew. They buy thread and now need to find a sewing machine. Meanwhile, Trevor keeps texting Regan to go to the strip club. At the strip club, Dale goes to wait in the car when finding out Becky's friends are coming. The three ladies show up and aren’t allowed in the strip club without a male escort so Dale gets them in. They go inside to clean off the dress. Trevor asks Regan to help Joe hook up with Katie, and they wind up in a history discussion. Clyde is trying to hook up with the stripper and realizes that his wallet is missing. As Gena tries to clean the dress in the bathroom, she starts talking to a stripper who uses the dress as a towel and toilet paper without her noticing. Afterwards, Regan yells at Gena for trying to confess to Becky over the phone. The girls begin arguing, and Regan yells at Gena saying she handles everything, including Gena's abortion. Gena gets Clyde, and they leave together with the dress. Trevor gets Joe to take Katie home and tells him to have sex with her, which he doesn't want to do because she's heavily intoxicated. Gena and Clyde argue on the subway since she stole his wallet and she is still mad about what happened between them. In high school, Gena got pregnant and she had to get an abortion without his help. Meanwhile, Trevor and Regan wind up having sex in the hotel bar bathroom. Becky calls her and asks her to come up to her room. Clyde and Gena go to his mother’s house who agrees to fix the dress. Clyde makes pancakes while Gena tries to call a cocaine dealer. He throws her phone outside telling her it’s not cute anymore. They wind up looking at old photos and he tells her that he couldn’t show up that day because he was too sad. They go into his bedroom where he plays her a mixtape he made when they were in high school and they end up having sex. Joe and Katie go off on their own and go swimming in an indoor pool at the hotel. They share stories about partying, and she tells him that she slit her wrist a year ago. He kisses her, and they get out of the pool. They’re going to have sex, but Joe tells her that he likes her a lot and cares how they have sex. He doesn’t want a random, drunken hook up with her. However, Katie can’t even remember his name. He leaves, both of them upset. Regan goes to Becky’s room. Becky feels bad about what happened earlier. She thanks Regan for everything she’s done and Regan sneaks off to the bathroom and leaves another message for Gena on her phone. Becky opens the door and catches Regan about to make herself throw up. They reminisce about high school and how Becky took the fall for Regan's bulimia. Regan is about to tell Becky about the dress when Becky’s mother shows up and tells them that it’s time for her to start getting ready. Gena and Clyde wake up. She grabs the dress and runs out. The party planners try to find the dress, confused as to where it could be. Joe tells Regan that Katie locked herself in the bathroom and won’t come out. Gena has the fixed dress and brings it back to the tailor in the hotel saying it’s fixed and asks her to clean it. She finally calls back Regan and tells her the dress needs 40 minutes. Regan finds Katie in the bathroom, and she seemingly having OD’d. Joe realizes that Katie took the Xanax that Trevor gave him at the strip club and calls the paramedics. Regan sticks her fingers down Katie’s throat and has her throw up the pills, getting some vomit on Regan's dress. Regan tells a nervous Becky that her dress is being steamed. Gena knocks on Trevor’s door and hits him with a coffeepot for giving Joe the Xanax. She then runs after Regan and Becky with the dress but misses them. She uses the same cab as Clyde who tells her that they are meant to be together. Becky screams at her mother and Regan in the taxi saying she hates both of them. They get to the wedding, and Becky is still screaming at Regan. Gena shows up with the dress and Becky notices the blood stain. She gets over it and walks down the aisle, leaving Gena and Regan, who has vomit on her, behind. Katie gets there late and the three of them sit on a bench watching the ceremony. At the reception, Joe and Katie talk and kiss, Regan tries to sleep, and Clyde gives an obscene speech about having sex with Gena the night before. He says he wants to do that forever and starts to sing I'm Gonna Be to her after which they kiss. The four girls dance together as the film closes."

Meanwhile, Oscar rides to work in a white limousine driven by his close friend and associate Céline; Oscar's job, it seems, involves using makeup, elaborate costumes, and props to carry out a number of complex and unusual scenarios. Of these, one has the actor performing an action sequence and simulated sex with an actress on a soundstage while he's filmed by an off-camera director. The second sequence puts him in a sewer with Monsieur Merde, a character who first appeared in Carax's segment in the omnibus picture Tokyo!; here, Merde falls in love with a beautiful model, Kay M., who accompanies him on a jaunt through a cemetery. Subsequent episodes cast Oscar in a deathbed melodrama, a gangster film, a musical alongside pop star Kylie Minogue, and much more.{{allrovi movie}}"

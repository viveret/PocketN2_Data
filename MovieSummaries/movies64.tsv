Luke was on his way home from football practice when the teen driver decides to go over a hill and decides to hill hop and make the car go airborne. He sped up the car to about 90 miles an hour and the car landed in a ditch 70 feet below. Luke suffered severe head trauma and broken bones. All the teens in the car except Zack Barnett were hospitalized. The doctor declared Luke brain dead the next day, Tuesday February 14th 2006. When Mrs. Abbate told the family about taking Luke to the DMV to get his learner's permit 3 months ago, she said that he asked ""What's organ donation?"" She explained it to him, and he said ""Yes I want to do that."" The family made the very very difficult decision to donate his organs. 5 people received parts of Luke's body parts. Including a lady from New York. She received his heart. The family then starts the journey to grieve the loss of Luke. Each family member dealt with it in their own way. The father starts working a lot more and the mom goes into a depression. Jon's grief though was an emotional roller coaster. One day, however, his mom takes him to weight training to try to change his appearance and get back to life again. His real life weight trainer portrays himself in the movie, and he gives Jon the speech about ""living for two."" When he feels a little bit better, but still grieving, he decides to go ahead and play football again. Then he goes to talk to his football coach  about switching his jersey number 40 to number 5. The number Luke wore. Wake Forest University was expected to come in last in the 2006 season. But with Jon Abbate's help, they end up an unlikely champion, sharing the Atlantic Coast Conference Championship with Georgia Tech and ending the season ranked 18th in the AP poll. Finally, at the end of the movie, the lady who receives Luke's heart came to their house and Steven Abbate listened to it, and her little girl says ""Are you Luke's Mommy?"" And she says ""Yes, yes I am."" And Mr. Abbate says ""Our Boy."" The plot is based on a true story, set in and around the events of the Wake Forest football team's 2006 season.

Working as an shy, friendless accountant in Manhattan, Jamie is beginning to wonder if true happiness is out of his reach. That is, until he meets Elissa who brings him to life. Blinded by love, he can't see that it's a mismatch from the start. When she suddenly stops communicating with him, Jamie finds himself heartbroken and alone again. After ten years of separation, he reluctantly calls Lianne for advice. But Lianne has her own problems and reminds Jamie that, in life, ""God is the big shot-caller"" and maybe God is trying to tell Jamie to love himself first.

His mother, Samantha Andrews, is a poor woman living in a mobile home who collects ceramic dolls as a hobby. She meets Gerald’s father, Edward Lamtet, a doll maker, and they fall in love. Samantha gets pregnant, but unfortunately, unbeknownst to Samantha, Edward is already married, leaving Samantha to raise the child, Gerald, by herself. Samantha being too proud to accept support money, Edward sends Samantha a ""Number 1"" doll. Gerald has trouble growing up. He is slightly mentally challenged due to being dropped on his head at birth by the inebriated on-call doctor. Gerald has few friends other than a neighborhood girl, Helen, and his mother’s eclectic friends; a clueless lush named Ethel, a mother-hen-like transvestite named Dolly, and the straight-and-narrow Kate. Gerald is a good boy, and although not very athletic, he loves bowling. At about age 30, Gerald has been working at the Bowling Emporium for several years. Helen is still a neighbor, and Samantha plays poker with her 3 friends every Friday night. One day Samantha learns that Gerald’s father has died, and that the doll maker’s son is positioning his company to be sold. She realizes she can now provide more for Gerald, because the doll she was given is a valuable ""Number 1"" doll, and all the “Number 1” dolls are needed to sell the company. That night, she plans to tell Gerald and her friends about the doll’s origin. Instead, Samantha unexpectedly dies and never gets to tell anyone about the doll and its value. As a way to cope with his loss, Gerald decides to have his mother cremated and her ashes put into her favorite doll . Gerald takes the doll, and mother, with him everywhere. One day, he takes her to the laundromat, and someone steals the doll while he is not looking. The police have little interest in searching for a lost ""doll"". So, Gerald takes it upon himself to find his mother. He puts up fliers of his mother as the doll. He checks the laundromat every day, to the annoyance of the clerk. In spite of his failures, Helen helps Gerald set up a fundraiser at the Bowling Emporium to raise enough money for a private investigator. At this fundraiser, we learn that Gerald can actually take care of himself, financially at least, because he is an excellent  bowler. However, he injures his foot and must go to the emergency room, where ironically he sees a little girl with his mother’s doll, or so he thinks. Gerald confronts the girl and discovers that there are many of the same dolls. The next day, however, Gerald gets an anonymous tip that allows them to track down the doll maker, only to find out that the doll maker has died and that the son of the doll maker is about to sell the company, along with all the “Number 1” dolls, within the next couple of days. They make an appointment to visit with the doll maker’s son. Mother’s doll has “mysteriously” re-appeared at the doll company’s museum. During the meeting, the son ignores Gerald’s request for the doll back and continues to prepare for the sale of the company, pushing it up to the next day. Neither Gerald nor the son put two-and-two together to realize that they are brothers, although Helen sees an uncanny resemblance. Gerald is desperate, and Gerald and with the help of Helen and friends, decides to break into the toy company after closing to steal his mother's ashes back. That night, Gerald, Helen, Dolly, with two of Dolly’s leather-clad friends, break into the building and make it to the museum, passing by security and avoiding the son, who is in his office speaking with his lawyer and assistant. As Gerald and the gang are attempting to exit the building with the doll, the son and his group find Gerald trying to get through the warehouse, and a fight and chase ensues. The chase ends at a wall of boxes in the warehouse where the son pulls a gun and insists on getting the doll back. At this point, the son’s assistant, who was his father’s assistant since day one, finally tells everyone the story about Gerald’s mother and how she came to own the ""Number 1"" doll. Everyone, to the son’s dismay, realizes that the son and Gerald are brothers. The lawyer also realizes that this makes Gerald part owner in the company, due to a flaw in the doll maker’s will. This leaves Gerald very rich and more importantly, the owner of the doll which contains his mother’s ashes. But Gerald does not forget his roots once he is rich. He marries Helen and continues to work at the Bowling Emporium, although he now is the owner; and everyday, Gerald’s mother watches over him as he comes and goes from her perch by the door."

In between there are flashbacks to the conversations she has had with the two students, scenes from their lives and the effect that their work in the sex industry is having on them and those close to them.

These sexual encounters inevitably lead to conflict in her relationship with her boyfriend who at one point demands to know if she is seeing someone else.

When asked who her clients are, Alicja simply replies that they are bored husbands.

The movie closes with an older Vicky sending a letter to Jonathan explaining this will be her last letter, thus identifying herself as the person sending the letters to the newspaper.

14658543The Crystal Cube is a science programme, based on shows such as Tomorrow's World. The show is hosted by Jackie Meld . In each episode, a different topic of science was to be discussed. In the pilot, it was genetics. Two guest scientists discussed the issue of genetics to a live studio audience and viewers at home. The scientists were Dr. Adrian Cowlacey , a practicing clinician at St. Thomas' Hospital, London, and Max Belhaven  of the Bastard Institute in California. Cowlacey and Belhaven comment positively on the prospects that in the future, society will be divided into a genetic caste system, with people divided into ""Alphas"", ""Betas"" and ""Gammas"" based on their genetic background . They also show an example of a genetically engineered human, Gareth Gamma 0001 , who is designed to carry out menial tasks without complaint. The show later goes into a debate between a member of clergy, The Bishop of Horley, The Very Reverend Previous Lockhort  and Martin Bealey , an anti-communist journalist who claims the Soviets are using genetics to invade Britain. However, Gareth interrupts the conversations and causes a riot. Cowlacey therefore ends the show.<ref nameThe Crystal Cube|series1|episode1983-07-07}}
23778616The Country Cousin tells the story of a mouse from ""Podunk""  coming to visit his relative in the city. The opening shot/title card is of the mouse in question, Abner, staring up at the city skyscrapers, with the sign directing him to Podunk facing the opposite way. He receives a telegram  from his cousin, Monty, telling him to ""Stop being a hick"" and come live with him in the city. Without specifying the location of Abner or Monty, the film sets out to contrast the lifestyles of the archetypal country and city inhabitants. Abner is shown walking along a railroad towards the city, and when he arrives, the differences between the two become clear. Abner is wearing overalls and is portrayed as bumbling and oblivious to the dangers of the city, whilst Monty sports a top-hat and is acutely aware of the problems they face . Monty leads Abner to a meal that the human residents of the household have set out. The two mice begin by dining on cheese, but Abner lacks any sense of etiquette, and soon begins gorging himself on celery, cream, and mustard, the latter of which generates a reaction to the excessive heat. Cooling himself with Champagne, Abner finds himself partial to the taste, and becomes drunk, provoking the disdain of Monty. Abner begins seeing in double vision, and creates more noise by bringing down a pile of bread . Abner then assesses his reflection  in a block of jelly . As he walks away, he slips on a piece of butter lying on a saucer. The saucer, spinning and flying across the table, catches Monty on the way, and breaks several pieces of dishware too. Monty is infuriated, and as the pair are now on the floor, he attempts to find a secluded spot, safe from the sleeping pet cat. The inebriated Abner, with a great sense of bravado, kicks the cat's behind, whilst his cousin rushes back to his home . The cat bares its teeth at Abner, which only leads him to inspect the inside of its mouth, thus bringing Abner back to his senses. He is then chased by the cat, first receiving an electric shock by jumping inside a socket , and then ending up on the city street when he jumps out of the window. Abner is faced with escaping from the footsteps of the people, a bike, an electric tram, and other vehicles. He finds himself at the city limits again, and flees back to his home town.

That’s where we have tried to go, to that place that no army can take away, that place full of pain and hope, of weariness and love, of struggle and desire.

The reluctant Bilal is to be the DJ. Kid is then involved in an altercation with school bully Stab  and his two brothers Pee-Wee and Zilla . When Kid comes home, he tries to convince his father, ""Pop""  to let him go to the party. At first Kid's father relents, but soon grounds Kid when a note from Kid's school informs him of the fight he was in. Rather than miss the party of the year, Kid sneaks out while his sleeping father is watching Dolemite - not realizing that his father woke up just as he closed the door. On his way to the party, Kid runs into Stab and his brothers, and ducks into an Alpha Delta Sigma reunion nearby to get away from them. Crashing the reunion, Kid has the DJ ([[George Clinton  scratch and mix a few of his old doo wop records so that he can liven the party with a rap, until Stab and the others turn up again. When trying to get away from Stab, he winds up knocking an older man down before attempting to make a run for it. However, Kid and the bullies are caught by the neighborhood police, who humiliate the four teenagers in front of the reunion party attendees before letting them go. Before that, he jumps over a fence to get away, ending up looking in a window where a fat man is having rough sex with his lady, and when he is discovered, Kid runs away, and the three punks are shot at. When Kid finally makes it to the house party, he finds it in full swing, with attractive girls Sydney  and Sharane  also in attendance. After some music and dancing, Kid and Play first get into a dance contest with Sidney and Sharane, and later have a quick freestyle battle. Stab and his friends attempt to break up the party, but are arrested a second time by the policemen, who take delight in the prospect of beating them up. Kid's father eventually makes his way to the party, demanding to know where Kid is. When he doesn't spot Kid - Kid is upstairs helping Sharane get her coat - Pop vows to wait for the boy at home. Although Kid and Sydney each have an eye for each other, Sharane decides to openly flirt with Kid, much to Sydney's disgust. The three of them soon leave the party, but when Kid tries to make advances on Sharane, she rebuffs him. Kid then walks Sydney back home, and after some argument the two of them finally calm down and make conversation. Sydney allows Kid to sneak into her house, and the two are about to have sex in Sydney's room when she stops him, wanting to know if she is simply his second choice. Kid admits that Sydney was his first choice all along, but they do not do anything when they see that the only condom Kid has is too old to be used. When Sydney's parents come home - now revealed as one of the couples at the high school reunion, including the man Kid ran into - Sydney hastily helps Kid sneak out of the house. He manages to get out of yet another scrape with Stab and his brothers, and they all end up in a jail cell, where Kid entertains the rest of the men in the cell by rapping, distracting them long enough for Play, Sharane, Bilal, and Sydney to arrive with enough cash to bail him out. Later on, the five friends say their goodnights. Kid and Sydney share a long passionate kiss goodnight. After Play and Bilal drops him off, Kid sneaks in the house and gets undressed. As he is about to get into bed, he looks up only to find Pop holding a belt. The movie then cuts to the credits where Pop whipping Kid can be heard.
1851374Stephen, a shell-shocked Vietnam veteran, returns from a mental hospital, which he entered voluntarily because he was suffering from nightmares about the war and had in consequence lost three jobs in a row. After having been treated and finally coming home again, he gets a new job as custodial engineer at a grammar school, but loses it again within less than one week because of a law forbidding people who spent time in a mental hospital to work within the vicinity of children. However, the Simmons family desperately need money, so Stephen continues looking for work, and finds a job picking potatoes. There he makes friends with a man called Moe Henry, with whose help he succeeds in obtaining a job working in a mine - his best one yet. In the meantime, the twins Lidia and Stu try to get away from the dreary reality of their lives. They find a tree in a forest close to their house and decide to build a tree house there. At first they and their friends argue over who has to construct it and who is allowed to use it; the three boys - Stu, Chet and Marsh - want it all to themselves, while the girls - Lidia, Elvadine and Amber - want them to work on it and share it afterwards. After several deals, they agree to build the tree house together. The girls get everything they need from the garbage heap belonging to the Lipnickis, a neighboring family with a reputation for bullying, who have a grudge against the Simmons and their friends. Unfortunately Billy, the youngest of the Lipnicki kids, discovers Lidia, Elvadine and Amber on his father's territory, so the girls have to pay him to keep quiet, but later his brothers force him to betray Lidia's secret. While the children are busy building their tree house, Stephen and Moe are caught in a collapse as they drain water out of a cavern. Moe is caught under falling rubble, but Stephen, who in Vietnam had to leave his best friend to die in order to be rescued himself, is determined to save him, even if it costs him his own life. He frees Moe, but is hit by falling rocks himself, and though the two men are both rescued, Stephen is badly hurt and comatose, being put on life-support in the hospital. While Stu and Lidia fear for their father's life, the Lipnickis find the treehouse and take it over, stealing the lock and key, which belonged to Stephen. However, they agree to return them if Stu can win a bet - swimming a lap around the inside of a water-tower while it drains - which he does. The children can keep the place, but not before the Lipnickis throw the key onto the rotted, treacherous roof of the water-tower, telling Stu that if he wants it, he can get it back himself. Shortly afterwards, their father is taken off life-support, and dies. When the kids run away from home to the tree house, they discover that the Lipnickis have returned. In the fight that erupts between them, the tree house is destroyed. Meanwhile, Billy Lipnicki protests against all the fighting, asking why they can't share the fort, but is ignored. He takes it on himself to go to the water tower to retrieve the key, but the roof caves in just as Stu and the others find him, and he almost drowns in the water tower. Stu rescues and resuscitates him together with Lidia, and Billy tells them he saw an angel, one who ""looked like [Stu,] only bigger,""  who told him he had to stay on Earth and take care of his family. From that time on the Lipnickis stop fighting with the others and stay out of their way, except for Billy, who becomes a good friend to them. The twins and their friends start to rebuild the tree house, but give it up after a couple of days due to lack of interest. Also, they find out that their father bought them a new house before he died and are happy to have a proper home again at last.

Holding opposing views on the issue of nature versus nurture, they make a wager of the ""usual amount"" and agree to conduct an experiment switching the lives of two people at opposite sides of the social hierarchy and observing the results. They witness an encounter between their managing director&mdash;the well-mannered and educated Louis Winthorpe III , engaged to the Dukes' grand-niece Penelope &mdash;and a poor street hustler named Billy Ray Valentine ; Valentine is arrested at Winthorpe's insistence because of a suspected robbery attempt. The Dukes decide to use the two men for their experiment. Winthorpe is publicly framed as a thief, drug dealer and adulterer by Clarence Beeks  at the request of the Dukes. Winthorpe is fired from Duke & Duke, his bank accounts are frozen, he is denied entry to his Duke-owned home, and he quickly finds himself vilified by Penelope and his former friends. He befriends Ophelia , a prostitute who agrees to help him in exchange for a financial reward once he is exonerated. Meanwhile, the Dukes bail Valentine out of jail, install him in Winthorpe's former job and grant him use of Winthorpe's home. Valentine soon becomes well-versed in the business using his street smarts to achieve success, and begins to act well-mannered. During the firm's Christmas party, Winthorpe is caught planting drugs in Valentine's desk in a desperate attempt to get his job back, and he brandishes a gun to escape. Later, the Dukes discuss their experiment and settle their wager for one dollar , before plotting to return Valentine to the streets. Valentine overhears the conversation, and seeks out Winthorpe. Winthorpe attempts suicide by overdosing on pills. Valentine, Ophelia and Winthorpe's former butler Coleman  nurse him back to health and inform him of the Dukes' experiment. On television, they learn that Clarence Beeks is transporting a secret report on orange crop forecasts. Winthorpe and Valentine recall large payments made to Beeks by the Dukes and realize that the Dukes plan to obtain the report to corner the market on frozen orange juice. The group agrees to disrupt their plan as revenge. On New Years Eve, the four board Beeks' Philadelphia bound train, intending to switch his report with a forgery. Beeks uncovers their scheme and attempts to kill them, but he is knocked unconscious by a gorilla being transported on the train. The four disguise Beeks with a gorilla costume and lock him up with the real gorilla. The forged report indicating that the year's orange crop will be low is then delivered to the Dukes. Valentine and Winthorpe then travel to New York City with Coleman and Ophelia's life savings to carry out their part of the plan. On the commodities trading floor, the Dukes commit all their holdings to buying frozen concentrated orange-juice futures contracts; other traders follow their lead, inflating the price. Meanwhile, Valentine and Winthorpe sell futures heavily at the inflated price. Following the broadcast of the actual crop report, showing that the orange crop will be normal, the price of orange-juice futures plummets. Valentine and Winthorpe buy back their futures at the lower price from everyone but the Dukes, turning a large profit. The Dukes fail to meet a margin call, and are left owing $394 million. Valentine and Winthorpe explain to the Dukes that they had made a wager on whether they could get rich while making the Dukes poor simultaneously. Valentine collects $1 from Winthorpe while Randolph collapses holding his chest and Mortimer shouts angrily at his brother about their failed plan. Beeks and the gorilla are loaded onto a ship heading for Africa. Meanwhile, the now wealthy Valentine, Winthorpe, Ophelia, and Coleman vacation on a luxurious tropical beach.

10667864{{Plot}} A Special Forces unit, known as the Painkiller Unit, is exposed to a biochemical weapon while on a mission in Sovetskaia, Chechnya. After attempting to retreat, the entire unit is ambushed and executed by a group of armed men in protective hazmat suits. One member of the unit, Captain Jane Browning , not only survives the execution, but recovers from the viral infection, and develops an abnormally rapid healing factor, increased dexterity, speed, strength, enhanced senses, mental abilities and a photographic memory. Her eyes enlarge to take in and process information at a hyper-normal rate, and her mind reorganizes what she has seen into analytical logic, such as plotting out a chess game and recognizing patterns in the type of a magazine article. She is taken to a US Army laboratory where scientists are trying to learn what happened so they can create an army of super-soldiers. The lead scientist who is helping to find out why she survived and changed when the others died is Dr. Graham Knight. She is told by Col. Ian Watts, her mentor, that the virus was created by a biochemical terrorist named Peter Erfan who has a genius IQ. As the US Army is transferring her to another base in Alaska, Knight passes her a note saying that they are never going to let her go. Jane escapes in an effort to find Peter Erfan and gain revenge on him for murdering her team. She goes to the university for help from Dr. Knight, but finds that Dr. Knight is not the man who was working with her at the army base. As she confronts the person she knew as Doctor Knight at his hotel, he reveals that he is Captain Lucas Hensley and is with military intelligence. He is undercover and investigating her superior officer, Col. Ian Watts. Hensley tells her that Watts created Erfan and used him as the perfect cover. Since Erfan didn't exist then he couldn't be caught. Hensley asks Jane to help catch him. She goes to confront Watts herself, but as she does so, they are both shot by an unknown assassin. As she is trying to contain the bleeding on Watts, some of her blood falls into his wound and mixes with his blood. It is implied that this may have allowed the colonel to recover from being shot. She goes after the shooter and he leads her to Lucas Hensley. Hensley admits that he is in fact Peter Erfan and has a vial of liquid which he has extracted from Jane. As he is talking with her the assassin starts to move in on her and she shoots him. Erfan refers to her as the new Eve, as something in her body altered the virus and then the virus changed her. This is why she survived but the rest of her unit did not. Erfan has been able to recreate this modified virus and already gave it to the assassin. As he is talking with her the assassin that was shot gets up and rips off a power box on the wall and hits Jane in the head with it. The next scene Erfan has her handcuffed in a helicopter and is taking her away. She breaks out of the handcuffs and starts fighting with Erfan. Shots are fired into the console of the helicopter and the assassin, who is piloting, loses control of the helicopter. This causes Erfan and Jane to fall out of the helicopter and they wrestle with each other while falling toward the water below. The next scene sees Col. Watts in a graveyard where he is standing over her tombstone. He then goes to the docks and gets on a boat. There he meets Jane and gives her a new identity and money. She sails off in the boat. The final scene sees a group of Asian gentlemen walking into a laboratory and meet with Lucas Hensley who apparently survived the fall unharmed. He holds a vial of green fluid, the genetic material for the enhancement virus in solution. The implication is that Erfan took the serum himself, in order to survive the impact with river and he will soon be creating an army of superhumans for the unnamed Asian business partner.

3150852The cartoon is a story-within-a-story. Daffy Duck is fed up with comedy and wants to try a dramatic act instead. He offers a script to the Warner Brothers executive ""J.L."", called The Scarlet Pumpernickel, which he wrote himself  As Daffy reads the script to J.L., the cartoon cuts away to various scenes and then back to J.L.'s office. Each time, Daffy announces a page number. By the cartoon's end, the script has exceeded 2 thousand pages . In this script, the clumsy Scarlet Pumpernickel  must save the Fair Lady Melissa from being married to a man she does not love, the Grand Duke ([[Sylvester  under the Lord High Chamberlain's  orders. Melissa loves Scarlet, but her happy mood is extinguished in a heartbeat when the Chamberlain orders her to ""Keep away from that masked ma-d-d-d-d-a-des-fradle-d-d-d-d... that masked stinker!"". The Chamberlain gets a brilliant plan and decides to marry Melissa to the Grand Duke in exchange for killing the Scarlet Pumpernickel. As planned, the Scarlet Pumpernickel is drawn to town to interrupt the wedding. He arrives disguised as a noble and uses the disguise to research and develop his plan for rescuing Melissa. Storming the wedding ceremony as she is walking up the aisle, he is instantly successful as Melissa tears herself from her father's arms and runs from the chapel, dragging Scarlet with her . Scarlet takes her back to the inn where he was staying, and leaves briefly. The Grand Duke stops for respite at the inn and spots Melissa on the staircase. He chases her and is bearing down upon her when Scarlet swings in. Notably in this segment of the plot there is a running gag in which Daffy compares his own daring stunts with those of Errol Flynn. The Grand Duke and the Scarlet Pumpernickel engage in an intense duel, but no conclusive ending is given as to who ultimately wins the battle. Daffy, as the scriptwriter, having only thought of the beginning and middle of the story, and being pressured by the enthusiastic ""J.L."", overdoes the ending as an unlikely series of random and accelerating natural disasters, including skyrocketing food prices , to which surprisingly, J.L. asks, ""is that all?"" At his wit's end, Daffy shoots through his hat in exhaustion, commenting, ""It's getting so you have to kill yourself to sell a story around here"". See Censorship for more details about the ending.

786972A fifty-year war between the Eastern Federation and Europa ends, with the Federation taking control of the Eurasian continent. A resistance movement rises in Zone 7 and the Federation mobilizes its military. However, the war and heavy industry have exhausted the Federation and polluted the environment. Dr. Azuma presents his discovery of Neo Cells, human cells that, in theory, can be converted to regenerate human tissue. The Neo Cells are only found in the genome of ""a primitive ethnic group."" He states that he can develop the Neo Cells for human use, but is quickly denounced. But Kaoru Naito, from Nikko Hairal Inc., offers Dr. Azuma sponsorship. Azuma is persuaded when Naito insinuates that accepting will also help Dr. Azuma cure his wife, Midori. A photo shoot at the Azuma Residence follows, commemorating Tetsuya's  engagement to Luna. They argue about Tetsuya joining the military. One year later, Tetsuya is deployed to Eurasia Zone 7. He kills civilians, and is killed by a booby trap. Azuma invites Luna's father, Dr. Kozuki, to his lab. They are rivals, since Azuma's cell research makes Kozuki's armor research redundant. However, although organs have been grown from the Neo Cells, they are not usable. Meanwhile, Midori, now almost blind, is visited by Tetsuya's ghost. Shortly after she is told of his death. His body is sent to Azuma's lab. Tetsuya's ghost sees the body. A lightning bolt strikes the facility and stimulates the Neo Cells, causing the limbs and organs to restructure into humans. Naito calls for the military to kill them. But a few escape and encounter Midori in her car, which they hijack. Azuma carries Tetsuya's body into his lab. Tetsuya is resurrected, but his condition is unstable, and he is brought to Kozuki's residence. Kozuki puts him in prototype battle armor. The Neo humans travel to Zone 7, sheltering in a derelict castle, where they discover a robot army. Calling themselves ""Neo-Sapiens,"" they vow revenge and reactivate the robots to wage war upon humanity. Kozuki's residence is attacked and Tetsuya is awakened. He kills a female Neo-Sapien, Saguree, but cannot save Kozuki. He escapes with Luna but is confronted by a robot battalion. After eliminating them Tetsuya battles the leader, Burai only to lose consciousness. When he comes to, he and Luna go to Zone Seven, but the route is contaminated, and Luna falls ill. Tetsuya is found in the forest by a doctor and led to a nearby village in Zone Seven, where the doctor treats Luna. It is revealed the people of Zone Seven aren't terrorists at all, but have been slaughtered for decades because of the government's discriminatory policies. The doctor, in conversation, informs Tetsuya of a local legend of a protective deity named ""Casshern""-a deity whose statue makes numerous appearances in the movie. Tetsuya fights Barashin as the village comes under attack by the military and Neo-sapiens, and it is here that he first refers to himself as Casshern. While both suffer injuries in the fight, Casshern is the victor and Barashin is killed. Fighting Barashin has caused Tetsuya to lose Luna, who escaped with a Neo-sapien and eventually found her way to a train full of captured villagers from Zone Seven. Here, Luna and the Neo-sapien are confronted by a bereaved scientist who blames the Neo-sapiens for the loss of his daughter. Luna is rescued by Dr. Azuma, but the Neo-sapien is injured. A coup d’état takes place and General Kamijo's son takes over, while in the laboratory Naito reveals that Neo Cells are not what they seem. The Neo Cells were acquired from the slaughtered ""original humans"" of Zone Seven for the purposes of prolonging General Kamijo and his cohorts' lives, and the Neo Cell culture did not in fact create the Neo-Sapiens. It simply rejoined the body parts that were harvested from the victims of Zone Seven after being struck by the stone lightning bolt. Even though Dr. Azuma had been spearheading the macabre experiments, he is unable to explain what has happened. As they talk, the stone lightning bolt crumbles and Casshern appears to fall from the sky into the laboratory, which is now in ruins. Burai arrives with an airship and abducts Luna, Casshern and the dying Neo-sapien, leaving a now fatally wounded Naito, Dr. Azuma and General Kamijo's son alone. Burai gives his reasons for hating humanity, and Casshern finds his mother, but she's apparently dead. Burai launches a giant machine that appears to be set to self-destruct, which slaughters countless soldiers. Casshern uses all his strength to stop the machine, although it still detonates, albeit away from any urban or heavily populated area. In the finale, the General's son kills Burai with a grenade after revealing he was human all along, and it is learned that Tetsuya, during his military service, slaughtered Burai's family. Casshern stops his father from resurrecting his mother, so Dr. Azuma retaliates by shooting Luna in the head. Luna is revived by the blood of Burai, only after Casshern kills his father. The souls of the dead come onto Casshern as he and Luna embrace each other. Luna rips out Tetsuya's containment suit and a pillar of light fires into space. It ends with a monologue by Tetsuya while the screen alternates between the pillar of light making its way through space & crashing down onto another planet and flashbacks of happier times for the characters. The film ends with home footage of the characters in happier times.

10195586Twenty years ago, a fire broke out in Lap Lan Girls' School and strange incidents started occurring in the school since then. The headmaster hanged himself from a tree while a student committed suicide by jumping off the school building. A silhouette of a person, like a shadow, appeared on a wall near the staircase, and it cannot be erased. Apart from typical school rules, an unreasonable regulation that forbids students from falling in love is strongly enforced in the school, as well as a curfew which states that students are not allowed to leave their dormitories after 11 at night. Whenever a student breaks a school rule or wanders out at night, she will hear a mysterious female voice coming from the sound system, calling her to enter the school office. The student is never seen again after she passes through a supernatural portal into that seemingly non-existent ""school office"". Each time someone goes missing, a new shadow will appear on that strange wall. In the present day, under the new education policy, the school accepts four boys  as students. The boys are confined to their classroom and dormitory, as the school aims to minimise interaction between them and the girls. However, the students still defy the rules and throw a secret party in the woods, after which, love begins to blossom among the youngsters. Unknown to them, their romance has already revived the curse within their school. Dick and Sze disappear after being pulled into the ""school office"" by a strange force, while Charlie and Kei die in the same manner as the previous headmaster and the suicide student respectively. The surviving students seek answers from their teacher, Miss Fong, who tells them that the strict school rules were actually set by a dean 20 years ago. The dean treated students harshly and punished offenders harshly in the school office while the headmaster never interfered in the dean's discipline system. One night, the dean was caught having an affair with the headmaster by the headmaster's wife, who locked her in the school office and burnt her to death in anger. The dean's spirit began haunting the school since then and she continued to ""enforce"" her rules in a spiritual way. Keung, Yat-man, Ben and Siu-fong work together to search for the exact location of the old school office and destroy it once more, as that is the only way to break the dean's evil curse.
2803158The film picks up where A Distant Thunder left off. Patty Myers  is faced with the decision to either accept the mark of the beast or lose her head. The soldiers strap her to the guillotine, but then flee due to a sudden earthquake. Left alone, Patty first screams for help, then that she wants the mark, only to die anyway as the earthquake causes the blade to fall on its own. Nearby, a woman named Kathy  and David Michaels  have just escaped a government detention center during the earthquake along with Kathy's young son Billy, and another woman named Leslie . The group evades the soldiers of the government, called UNITE . Kathy, David, and Billy become separated from Leslie  when a UNITE soldier shoots her below the shoulder, and David leaves her lying on the ground because she appears to be dead. The trio eventually meets up with the Rev. Matthew Turner . By this time Rev. Turner's church has been forced to close by the government, and he is living underground as a survivalist. Kathy and David attempt to use their knowledge of computers to create a fake ""mark of the beast"" which will allow them to move about freely in society; David rationalizes this by saying they are not taking the real mark. Rev. Turner disagrees and does not use the fake mark himself, but remains in his hideout where he has been living off the land as a small farmer. Kathy also finds the mark morally questionable, but David convinces her that they have no choice. The fake mark allows Kathy and David to move about freely through checkpoints where guards are checking people to make sure they have the mark, but when they attempt to use it to buy groceries, the plan falls through. Meanwhile, the Bible prophecies in the Book of Daniel and the Book of Revelation, as explained by the Rev. Turner, begin coming to pass. A new world leader is installed who speaks to the world through a computer-generated image broadcast on television. Earthquakes, wildfires, and a nuclear war occur. Eventually, David reunites with Leslie, and they are set up by, of all people, Sandy. Initially frustrated in her attempts to hack the mark, Kathy eventually realizes that the barcode system itself is the source code for the mark. Unfortunately, Kathy is discovered by Dianne, who tries to arrest her. Dianne is crushed to death by a giant locust, and while Kathy flees, she is stung. We do not know what becomes of her after that, though David later implied  that she died. Turner is also stung. Billy is arrested, and locked up with Leslie and David, then Leslie leads him to Christ before she is sent to be executed. The guards want David to convince Billy to take the mark, but after Billy tells David that Leslie led him to Christ, he instead tells Billy to close his eyes and put his faith in God. Both David and Billy are then faced with execution themselves.
28014683The film opens with homemade videos of Jack and Jill growing up. As the videos progress, it seems that Jack is the more gifted twin, with Jill constantly trying to get his attention by hitting him, hurting girls around him, etc. The film then goes to an adult Jack , a successful advertising executive in Los Angeles with a beautiful wife  and two kids, Sofie and Gary. Jack is incredibly irritated about the holiday visit of his ""identical""{{cite web}} twin sister Jill , as he has to pick her up at 4:00am. Following a series of problems from the airport to the house, Jack's patience is soon stretched increasingly thin. Jill's neediness and passive-aggressiveness is maddening to Jack, turning his normally tranquil life upside down. Jill starts ruining Thanksgiving dinner by talking loud, calling one of the guests homeless, and then runs away into the woods near the house with her pet Cockatoo. Jill says she has a list of things she wants to do before she leaves; she wants to be on a game show, go horseback riding, and do a studio tour. She tells them she has an open-ended ticket and Jill decides to stay until the end of Hanukkah. Meanwhile, Jack's client wants him to get Al Pacino to appear in a Dunkin Donuts commercial. Jill tries online dating, but doesn't get much of a response until Jack poses as Jill and alters her profile, leading her to get over 100 responses. When her date, ""Funbucket"" , meets her, however, he runs away and hides in the bathroom. Feeling guilty, Jack takes her to the Lakers game where Al Pacino is supposed to be. Pacino develops a crush on Jill as he gives her his phone number on a hot dog, written in mustard and ketchup. Jack hopes Jill would leave by New Year's Eve since Jack and his family are going on a cruise. All of Jack's friends throw him a birthday party and extend it to Jill as well, having never known that he even had a sister. Later, Pacino takes Jill to his home and lets her pick out a cake. The next day, Jill is leaving, until Jack's gardener, Felipe, takes her to the park to have fun. Jack doesn't want Jill to be alone on New Year's, so he invites her to the cruise, but she won't go. Pacino and Jack strike a deal in which Pacino will do the commercial if he gets a date with Jill. Jack disguises himself as Jill and goes on the date with Pacino. As Jack learns how much Pacino cares about Jill, he realizes that he loves his sister, and races back to the ship. Once there, however, he learns that Jill has gone back home to the Bronx. Jill goes to a restaurant with a picture of the twins' deceased mother. Jack and the family show up and celebrate with her. At the restaurant they see an old high school classmate, Monica  who attacks Jack's wife, but is stopped by Jill. Afterwards, they go to Jill's house, which Felipe has decorated to declare his love for Jill. She is overjoyed that someone loves her, and embraces him. Pacino also shows up at the party &mdash; in costume after a performance of Man of La Mancha &mdash; to declare his love, but steps aside once he sees that Jill is happy with someone else. The film ends with the commercial that Pacino stars in, promoting a new coffee Dunkaccino as a rap song. Pacino hates the commercial and tells Jack to destroy every copy and threaten everyone who has seen it.

His stories are hard hitting and mostly based on real life incidents and he tackles the issue head on. Now he has turned director with Malayalam film Bombay March 12, set against the serial bomb blasts that rocked the metropolis in 1993. The film makes the point that a person not even remotely connected with the event can become a victim just because of his name and the religion he believes in. The story is about Sameer , a sweeper with the Alapuzha Municipality, who is always on tenterhooks because he is on the police radar whenever there is trouble or an act of terror occurs. Later it is revealed that his brother-in-law Shahjahan  was suspected to be part of the terror team that had planted bombs in Bombay  in 1993 and was later killed in an encounter with the Army in Andhra Pradesh. The narrative moves back and forth, slowly connecting Sameer with Shahjahan who had gone to Bombay as an IT professional, from whom much was expected by his family. The innocent youngster gets entangled in the web of a terror group and goes into hiding fearing the safety of his loved ones. The storytelling is complicated and you need to be focused as every scene exposes yet another layer of the story, something Babu Janardhanan did as a writer in the Lijo Jose Pellissery directed City of God recently. But there is always a niggling thought at the back of our minds that the point he is trying to make – that 'one bad egg can spoil the whole basket' – could have been conveyed just as well in a more simple and linear narrative. Mammootty plays one of his most subdued roles in recent times. Roma as his wife Abida may look to be a mismatch for Mammootty but the age difference is justified in the story. Sadiq, who appears as Shahjahan's father, is the surprise package of the film. Unni Mukundan as Shahjahan has the role of a parallel hero and does full justice to the confidence that the director has reposed in him.

Since being dumped by Vanessa , Kumar has let himself go; he has not become a doctor since failing a drug test, and still lives in the messy apartment that he once shared with Harold Lee , who has become a successful businessman on Wall Street. Harold's assistant, Kenneth , persuades him to buy a 3D television as a gift for Harold's father-in-law. As Harold and Kenneth leave the building, they are attacked by protestors who throw eggs at them. Vanessa visits Kumar and tells him that she is pregnant with his child, shocking him. The two get into an argument and Vanessa leaves. After arriving home, Harold is seduced by his wife Maria , but their attempt to conceive is interrupted by the arrival of her father , who dislikes Harold. He explains to Harold that he has never had a perfect Christmas, and is counting on Harold to make this one the best for his daughter. He has brought a tree that he has grown for eight years and deemed the perfect Christmas tree. When a package addressed to Harold arrives at Kumar's apartment, Kumar decides to deliver it to Harold. The package turns out to be a large marijuana joint that Kumar cannot resist smoking. Since Harold has gotten married and does not get high anymore, he throws the lit joint out of the window and it 'magically' flies back into another window and lands on the tree, causing a fire that destroys it. To replace it, Harold reserves one of the last Christmas trees available at a nearby lot. Kumar, feeling bad that he may have ruined Christmas for Harold, decides to purchase a replacement tree, and bribes the tree lot into selling him the tree that Harold reserved.

31423990	/m/0gk_twk	Fire in Babylon			80	{}	{}	"{""/m/0jtdp"": ""Documentary""}"	"The documentary describes the ascension of West Indies cricket from being a team largely composed of highly talented, entertaining, ""Calypso Cricketers"" to a determined unit that dominated world cricket for nearly twenty years. It begins with an introduction to the West Indies Cricket Team. Using interviews with West Indian cricketing greats, and other people closely associated with West Indies cricket; the idea of culturally and politically different Caribbean nations playing under the common banner of the West Indies is described. The history of cricket in the West Indies is briefly described, such as the appointment of Sir Frank Worrell as the first black man to captain the West Indies Cricket Team, and the emergence of such cricketing greats as Everton Weekes, Learie Constantine, and Sir Garfield Sobers. However talented these individual cricketers were, they were unable to fetch results, resulting in the West Indies being perceived as ""Calypso Cricketers""; people who were entertaining, but would ultimately lose. The early 1970s saw the emergence of a new crop of West Indian cricketers, ones eager to shake the tag of Calypso, and who could dominate world cricket. However, it is said that when you have 10 young men from various islands in the Caribbean, you don't have a team; you have a gang. What was needed was a guiding hand, who could steer this young team in the right direction, and unite them for a common cause on the cricket field. That man was Clive Lloyd. Appointed as Captain in 1974, Lloyd's first major challenge came in the 1975-76 West Indies Tour of Australia. Australians Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson destroyed the West Indies with their fast bowling. Frequent bouncers and intimidatory tactics led to the spirit of the team being shattered and the tour ended with Australia winning the six-match test series 5-1. At the end of the series, Clive Lloyd realizes that in order to win, it would be necessary for him to also cultivate fast bowlers as devastating as Lillee and Thomson. When the Indian Cricket Team toured the West Indies in 1976, Clive Lloyd tested his new plan of attack, relentlessly getting his fast bowlers such as Andy Roberts, Michael Holding, and Colin Croft to bowl short-pitched or bouncers to Indian batsman. While playing at Kingston, Jamaica the Indian team declared on a second-innings lead of 12, after the management decided that they would rather not risk sending their bowlers such as Bishen Singh Bedi to face the fearsome fast bowling. Convinced of the effectiveness of pace bowling as an instrument to success, Clive Lloyd's team departed to their Tour of England in 1976. England Captain Tony Greig's infamous ""grovel"" comment is shown in is entirety, and the effect it had on galvanising the team is described. After some highly aggressive fast bowling against the English batsmen, West Indian fast bowling is seen as being dangerous to the game. However, the West Indians feel that if the Australians could do it, so could they. Viv Richards is shown as dominating the Test series as a batsman, where he scored 829 runs in four tests with two double-centuries. Viv Richards' refusal to be intimidated by fast bowling is also seen as the ideal way for a batsman to deal with West Indian bowling. The documentary then describes the struggle with their board for better pay, and how Kerry Packer eventually enticed the team to participate in World Series Cricket in 1977. World Series Cricket turns out to be a fore-runner of changes in cricket that only became permanent in the 1990s; such as coloured kits, day/night matches, and a greater emphasis on professionalism in play. The West Indian team emerges from the tournament fitter, stronger, and with a more professional outlook to the game. The 1982 Rebel Tour to Apartheid-ruled South Africa is described. Colin Croft chooses to go, earning him a life ban from the West Indies Cricket Board. The main target of the regime, however, is international superstar Viv Richards. Richards states that he was offered ""a blank cheque"", but decided to not go as it would validate the state-sponsored racism pursued by the South African Government at the time. It ends with a description of the West Indies' tour to England in 1984. With the emergence of fast bowling greats such as Joel Garner and Malcolm Marshall to take the place of Croft, the West Indies becomes unstoppable. After Gordon Greenidge's innings of 214 not out at Lord's, the West Indians become an unstoppable force; defeating England 5-0 in the five-test series. In a turn on the regular term ""Whitewash"" to describe such a win, the series was instead dubbed Blackwash. The documentary ends with a description of how the West Indians earned the respect, admiration, and love of cricket fans and even opposing teams from across the world. As the end credits roll, Michael Holding describes how between February, 1980 to March, 1995; the West Indies Cricket Team did not lose a single Test series."

Once there, {{Nihongo}}, the head of the prison, places the {{Nihongo3}} seal on Naruto which limits his chakra. On the first night, Naruto uses a clone as a decoy to escape from prison. During his escape, his clone is secretly taken by Mui to have the Nine-tailed beast's chakra extracted which leads him to learn about Naruto's escape plan. Naruto is shortly recaptured and placed in solitary confinement which delays Mui's plans. During his time in prison, Naruto befriends {{Nihongo}}, a female ninja from the Hidden Grass Village pretending to be a male inmate. She explains Mui and a select few from the Hidden Grass Village framed Naruto to imprison him so they may extract the Nine tails' chakra to release the seal on the Box of Enlightenment which can grant any wish. Ryuzetsu also shares her plans to avenge her childhood friend {{Nihongo}}, Mui's son whom was sacrificed to the box ten years prior. Naruto accepts her offer of collaboration to destroy the box before it is unsealed. They begin their plan by initiating a prison riot which distracts the guards and allows Naruto to find the room with the sealed box. He is then captured by Mui and has his chakra extracted which unlocks the box. Disregarding his collaborators commands, Mui asks the box to return his son. Muku is released from the box and is possessed by the box's demon, {{Nihongo}}. He fatally wounds his father, transforms into a monster, and goes on a rampage. Naruto enters Sage Mode but is unable to defeat it. He is assisted by his peers from the Leaf Village and Cloud Village who were aware of the Hidden Grass' plans. During the battle, Naruto and Ryuzetsu are fatally wounded. Mui regains consciousness and seals Muku with the Tenrou which gives Naruto a chance for a direct attack. Muku returns to his human form, has a short bonding experience with his father, and kills him when Satori regains control. Muku then kills himself by using the Tenrou and Satori returns to the box after his death. With Mui's death, the prisoners are free from the Tenrou and attempt to escape from prison but are quickly recaptured. As Naruto nears death, Ryuzetsu uses a technique which sacrifices her life to save him. In the aftermath, the Box of Enlightenment is thrown into the ocean and Naruto returns to his comrades after burying Mui and Ryuzetsu.

Yeshi was recognized as the reincarnation of Rinpoche’s uncle, a renowned Dzogchen master, who had died after the Chinese invaded Tibet. Yeshi grew up in Italy and wanted nothing to do with this legacy. He had no interest in being a teacher like his father. Nor did he want to return to Tibet and the monastery of Rinpoche’s uncle to meet the students waiting for him since his birth – something that his father continually admonished him to do. Instead, he dreamed of a normal life, away from the hoards of devoted students that always surrounded his father. Through intimate scenes Yeshi is shown growing from 18 years old to 39 years old and maturity, and his father who begins the story in his 50-year-old prime ages to 70 years and his senior years. As the story unravels, what is at stake for Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche is his spiritual tradition, for Yeshi it is his own identity. Will Yeshi’s Western lifestyle replace his family tradition and his spiritual roots? Will his father succeed at transplanting the vanishing Tibetan heritage to the Western world? As time moves forward, both father and son begin to change. The image of water and swimming, Namkhai Norbu’s beloved pastime, is used as a repetitive thematic pillar through the film as a representation of his teachings of integration and emptiness. The natural sounds of chanting and song, combined with added effects and carefully scored music, is used to express a non-verbal sense of the spiritual world Norbu Rinpoche seeks to transmit to his son, and to the West.

After capturing an attractive female demon, Nie Xiaoqian, Yan falls in love with her and realises that his master sent him there to make him learn how to control his emotions. Xiaoqian also falls in love with Yan, and while he feeds her candy, she says she will fall in love with anyone who fed her candy. After some time, she begs him to kill her because humans and demons are not supposed to be together. Yan stabs her with his magic dagger, which does not kill Xiaoqian, but causes her to lose her memory of their relationship. Yan arrives late for a battle against the Tree Demon, Laolao, and sees that several of his fellow demon hunters have already fallen. The last one, Xia Xuefenglei, embeds his arm into Laolao and tells Yan to chop it off, thereby banishing Laolao from the mortal world. Many years later, a tax collector named Ning Caichen passes by a village near Black Hill and stops to drink from a well. He is surrounded by the villagers, who initially accused him of stealing water because they are experiencing a drought, but later mistake him for an official sent by the government to help them find a new water source. Glad to be free, Ning goes up the hill, accompanied by a guide and five convicts, the only men the villagers are willing to send away with him. They stop for a break in a glade, and Ning goes inside a hollow tree and offers candy to a tiny, pale fox he sees there. A strange wind blows and they all run up the hill to a temple called Lanruo Temple, where they find a well. While Ning investigates the well, the other men notice some beautiful women in the temple and follow them further in. The women are actually demons in disguise and they suck the life out of the men to feed Laolao with ""life energy"". Xiaoqian shows up and attempts to seduce Ning, but he rejects her. Yan Chixia arrives and starts slaying the other demons. Ning and Xiaoqian flee and hide in a tree, where he offers her candy. The next day, Ning goes back to the temple with an underwater bomb, intending to blow up the well and release water for the village. He is attacked by two snake demons but Xiaoqian protects him from them and is injured herself in the explosion. Yan saves them, and he ties Ning to a horse and sends him back to the village while he uses his magic powers to heal Xiaoqian. Ning escapes, knocks Yan out and ties him to a tree. Laolao later insists that Xiaoqian feeds on Ning but she sends him away. Laolao punishes Xiaoqian while the villagers hold a feast for Ning. Ning leaves the village and frees Yan, who tells him that Xiaoqian is actually a demon. Ning still goes to the temple to bring Xiaoqian away with him. Laolao attempts to trap Yan by creating an illusion but Yan recognises the danger. In the meantime, Ning allows Xiaoqian to tap on his ""life energy"" to help her heal faster, after which they have sex. The next morning, Laolao appears before Xiaoqian and tells Xiaoqian that her body is still in Lanruo Temple so she can never be happy together with Ning. Yan arrives and drags Xiaoqian away. Just then, Xia Xuefenglei and his younger sister Xia Bing show up and they defeat Yan and lock Xiaoqian in a magic cage. They tie up Yan in front of the cage so that he can watch Xiaoqian disintegrate before his eyes. Back in the village, the villagers start transforming into trees because the water they drank is cursed. While Xuefenglei goes to the temple to destroy Laolao and end the curse, Ning frees Yan and Xiaoqian. Xuefenglei defeats the two snake demons but Laolao is now free.

In the meantime, Ning allows Xiaoqian to tap on his ""life energy"" to help her heal faster, after which they have sex. The next morning, Laolao appears before Xiaoqian and tells Xiaoqian that her body is still in Lanruo Temple so she can never be happy together with Ning. Yan arrives and drags Xiaoqian away. Just then, Xia Xuefenglei and his younger sister Xia Bing show up and they defeat Yan and lock Xiaoqian in a magic cage. They tie up Yan in front of the cage so that he can watch Xiaoqian disintegrate before his eyes. Back in the village, the villagers start transforming into trees because the water they drank is cursed. While Xuefenglei goes to the temple to destroy Laolao and end the curse, Ning frees Yan and Xiaoqian. Xuefenglei defeats the two snake demons but Laolao is now free. Yan shows up and rescues Xuefenglei. Xiaoqian, Ning and Xia Bing also arrive. While Yan and Xuefenglei fight with Laolao, Xia Bing uses magic to open the frozen well and Ning climbs inside to find Xiaoqian's body. Laolao absorbs Xiaoqian's spirit into her own body. Ning frees the spirits trapped by Laolao and they start attacking her. Yan uses his magic mirror to knock Xiaoqian's spirit out of Laolao and transfers himself into Laolao's body. Ning finds Xiaoqian's body in the form of the tiny, white fox. Yan and Laolao transfigure between each other. When Yan gains control of their shared body, he pulls his magic dagger out of Xiaoqian's head and she suddenly recalls everything about their past romance. Yan stabs himself with the dagger to kill Laolao, but he is also mortally wounded in the process. Xiaoqian and a dying Yan are reunited again. Xiaoqian tells Ning to put her body down so that she can disappear together with the temple, which is now falling apart. She pushes Ning out of the temple to join Xuefenglei and Xia Bing, who are waiting outside. The following day, as Ning is about to leave the village, he hears Xiaoqian's voice calling his name."

Dhanushkodi, the Indo-Sri Lankan border town, is the crucible wherein History is brewing this concoction of defeated lives and exhausted dreams. Hope is a big word and resistance but a tired expression. Three decades of struggle for a nation is washed out, a race obliterated. For, there is no one fighting their war back home now. Heroic images have turned to dust. The bunkers run with the wasted blood. Smoke rises from heaps of putrid flesh. Unwanted lives rot away in barbed wire human zoos. The misery spills over to the Indian shore. Fishermen fishing in fear in ignorance of friendly and enemy waters get dumped as rebels, spies and smugglers and unceremoniously beaten to death or shot or maimed. Yet, each morning sees their boats launched once again to the sea as the sea is their motherland and the language of fish their mother tongue. Manimekalai, the filmmaker, Munusamy, the fisherman, Rosemary, the social worker in Jesuit Christian Refugee Services, try hard to retain their sanity in this mad jumble. Their interactions with the dead or living refugees, their skirmishes with the Indian and Sri Lankan States, their personal lives overrun by external events - form the kernel of this narration.

Dhanushkodi, the Indo-Sri Lankan border town, is the crucible wherein History is brewing this concoction of defeated lives and exhausted dreams. Hope is a big word and resistance but a tired expression. Three decades of struggle for a nation is washed out, a race obliterated. For, there is no one fighting their war back home now. Heroic images have turned to dust. The bunkers run with the wasted blood. Smoke rises from heaps of putrid flesh. Unwanted lives rot away in barbed wire human zoos. The misery spills over to the Indian shore. Fishermen fishing in fear in ignorance of friendly and enemy waters get dumped as rebels, spies and smugglers and unceremoniously beaten to death or shot or maimed. Yet, each morning sees their boats launched once again to the sea as the sea is their motherland and the language of fish their mother tongue. Manimekalai, the filmmaker, Munusamy, the fisherman, Rosemary, the social worker in Jesuit Christian Refugee Services, try hard to retain their sanity in this mad jumble. Their interactions with the dead or living refugees, their skirmishes with the Indian and Sri Lankan States, their personal lives overrun by external events - form the kernel of this narration. Soori, a half-wit Sri Lankan Tamil, who connects to the world through his radio, stands aloof in this bleak world of despair sending lightning jolts of truth into the dark recesses of History. No wonder, he vanishes into the blue and Manimekalai is forced by the State to return to the world of civil obedience.

Twelve-year-old Sam Shakusky  is an orphan who is attending a ""Khaki Scout"" summer camp, Camp Ivanhoe, led by Scout Master Ward . Suzy Bishop  lives on the island with her attorney parents—Walt  and Laura  — and three younger brothers in a house called Summer's End. Sam and Suzy met the previous summer during a church performance of Noye's Fludde by Benjamin Britten, and they remained pen pals over the following year. They made a secret pact to reunite the following summer and run away together. Sam brings camping equipment, and Suzy brings six books, her cat, and a record player. They spend several days hiking and camping together in the wilderness with the goal of reaching a secluded cove on the island, which they name Moonrise Kingdom. They dance on the beach and their young romance blossoms. Suzy's parents, the police, and the Scout master eventually find them at the cove. Suzy returns with her parents and is forbidden from seeing Sam again. Sam stays with police Captain Sharp  while they await Social Services , who will place him in a ""juvenile refuge"" because his foster parents no longer wish to house him. The Scouts, who previously were not kind to Sam, later decide it is their duty to help the young lovers run away again. Suzy, Sam, and the other Scouts seek out the help of Cousin Ben , an older relative of one of the Scouts who works at the larger Khaki Scout summer camp, Fort Lebanon, run by Commander Pierce. After many twists and turns, Sam and Suzy eventually are apprehended on a church steeple during a violent hurricane and flash flood, evoking the earlier references to Noah. The church steeple is destroyed by lightning, but everyone survives. Sharp decides to become Sam's legal guardian, saving him from the orphanage and allowing him to remain on the island and be with Suzy. The last scene takes place at Summer's End, with Sam painting a landscape of the cove and then slipping out the window as Suzy and her brothers are called to dinner."

Rama and Lakshmana return to Ayodhya to face Urmila, the spirited wife of Lakshmana. Rama replies to her reproaches for abandoning Sita in the Dandakaranya forests, through which they have just journeyed, that the husband of Sita is only a servant of the people of Ayodhya. The next day, Vasishta arrives to suggest that Rama perform the Ashvamedha yaga  but Rama cannot do without his wife by his side. He is averse to taking a second wife, as Vasishta further suggests. The anguish of Rama at this point is juxtaposed with the people of Ayodhya joyously celebrating the harvest. Bharata, a brother of Rama who had left Ayodhya twelve years ago, returns. He objects to Rama performing the yaga without Sita. Their argument almost culminates in a physical fight, but nature intervenes; the skies open and a cooling rain pours down upon them. The yaga begins, with Lakshmana accompanying the horse. The horse strays into Valmiki's ashram , where Rama's son Lava and Kusha are being brought up. Lava stops the horse and is ready to fight Lakshmana . Lakshmana orders that the horse be released, but once again nature takes a hand. Valmiki is strangely moved by what he sees, and he begins to compose the Uttara Rama Charita – the story of Rama. The horse is led back to Ayodhya, and the ritualistic second stage of the yaga starts. Just then Rama receives the news that Shambuka has resumed his penance, and Lakshmana is despatched to slay the erring shudra. As the ceremony nears completion, Valmiki arrives with Lava and Kusha, but Vasishta debars Valmiki from entering the yagashala. Rama recognises Lava and Kusha as his sons, and takes them to his heart. The joy of Sita, then, is represented in the glorious splendour of nature.  The film ends with an epilogue depicting Rama's last journey, the Mahaprasthana, as he walks into the river with fire in his hand and becomes one with Sita, the all-pervading nature.

Superimposed in the haze are dissolving scenes of American conflicts from the American Revolutionary War through Desert Storm. At the misty base of the falls, a glass-like figure materializes from the fog and walks toward the camera. As it draws closer, it assumes the features and flesh tones of George Washington who states, “In my years of public service for this nation, I have observed one truth...that no people can be bound to acknowledge the Invisible Hand which conducts the affairs of men, more than the people of the United States. Every step by which they have advanced to the character of an independent nation seems to have been distinguished by some token of providential agency.”  Washington’s figure morphs into that of Benjamin Franklin who declares, “Everywhere I turn today, I see dissent. I see, Sir, those who say this great American experiment cannot work. They fail in their understanding, to realize that their very right to say that, was paid for with human life. Yet, for their own marginal good and safety, they are freely willing to forsake the heritage of this nation. To those I say.... They, that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.” Franklin turns from the camera, transposing into President John Adams who proclaims, “Posterity—you will never know how much it has cost my generation to preserve your freedom. I hope you will make good use of it.... If you do not, I shall repent it in Heaven, that I ever took half the pains to preserve it.” Adams fades as the Niagara setting dissolves to a stage scene with Charlton Heston addressing the audience, “That proclamation, addressing posterity, was spoken by John Adams, the second President of the United States.

He and his son Uriel  are both professors at the Talmudic Research department of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Uriel, a young charismatic academic, is extremely popular in his sessions with the department's students and the general public, and is also recognized by the establishment when he is elected member of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities. The father, on the other hand, is a stubborn old-school purist in his research methods. He is unpopular, unrecognized, and frustrated by his would-be lifetime research achievement having gone unfulfilled, as a rival scholar, Prof. Yehuda Grossman , published similar results one month ahead of Eliezer. Eliezer is also highly critical of the new methods of research used by his son and other modern researchers, as he considers them feather-light and superficial. His greatest ambition is to be recognized by being awarded the Israel Prize, but he is bitterly disappointed every year when he does not win it. His stubborn nature and lack of recognition have made him bitter and anti-social, and envious of his son's popularity. During his routine afternoon walk from the National Library back to his Rehavia home, Eliezer receives a phone call from the Minister of Education. She tells Eliezer that he was elected this year's laureate of the Israel Prize, and congratulates him. The following day Uriel is summoned to an urgent meeting with the Israel Prize committee. In the meeting Uriel is told that a grave error had occurred, and that in fact it was he, not his father, who was elected laureate of the Israel Prize. The committee wishes to discuss ways to correct the error, but Uriel objects, saying that the revelation would devastate his father. Uriel and the head of the committee, Eliezer's rival Professor Grossman, argue bitterly over the issue, until Uriel loses his temper and punches Grossman. Regretting his outburst, Uriel relents, but asks that he break the news to his father personally. The committee grants him that. We here discover that not only has Uriel been submitting his father's name for the Israel Prize every year, but that Grossman has been vetoing it every time. According to Grossman, Eliezer never published anything significant in his career, and his only claim to fame is being mentioned as a footnote in the work of a more famous scholar. Uriel goes to the National Library to break the news to his father, but finds him raising a toast to winning the prize with colleagues, a toast which he reluctantly joins. Unable to break the news, he once again meets with Grossman, asking that the prize be given to Eliezer nonetheless. Grossman eventually relents, but with two conditions: one - that Uriel would write the committee's recommendation, and Grossman would only sign it; and two - that Uriel himself would never be a candidate for the Israel Prize. Though horrified by the second condition, Uriel agrees. Uriel writes the recommendation text on his word processor, debating its phrasing with himself, picking and choosing every word carefully; at the same time Eliezer, finally recognized, is interviewed by the newspaper Haaretz, during which he denounces the scientific and academic validity of his son's research. When the interview is published, Uriel initially takes the punch and keeps his secret. Later, unable to endure the insult any longer, he whispers the secret to his mother, Yehudit, revealing the error. During preparations for a television interview, Eliezer is dumbfounded by a word in the Israel Prize committee's recommendation. He flees the television studio and returns to his study. As a philologist, he examines the word, cross-checking its published uses, and realizes that the text must have actually been written by his son. In his memory he reconstructs his phone conversation with the Minister of Education, realizing she had addressed him by his last name only. He concludes that the minister thought she was talking to his son, not to him, when she broke the news about the Israel Prize. On the day of the prize ceremony, Eliezer and Yehudit arrive at the Jerusalem International Convention Center to prepare for the ceremony, with each knowing Eliezer's prize is based on an error, but not discussing it; Eliezer is excited but also highly stressed, and perhaps devastated. The movie ends a moment before the laureates are called to the stage. It therefore remains unknown whether Eliezer actually received the prize, knowing it was based on an error, or eventually declined it.

Large cities are left as tombs and survivors cling together in rural pockets, fearing nightfall. When his family is slaughtered, young Martin is taken under the wing of a grizzled, wayward vampire hunter, ""Mister."" Mister takes Martin on a journey through the locked-down towns of America's heartland, searching for a better place in the famed 'New Eden', up north, while taking down any bloodsuckers that cross their path. Along the way, they are joined by fellow travellers, the first being a nun known only as Sister, whom they rescue from two young rapists that Mister kills without hesitation. They continue to move north, avoiding major thoroughfares that have been seized by The Brotherhood, a fundamentalist militia headed by Jebedia Loven, that interprets the plague as the Lord's work. The group is then captured by The Brotherhood and it is revealed that one of the rapists killed by Mister was Loven's son, and as punishment, Mister is left at the mercy of a group of vampires. Martin promptly escapes the Brotherhood camp and discovers that Mister has survived the vampire attack. They drive off together, making a stop at a survivors roadhouse where they pick up another traveler, the pregnant Belle, who hopes to make it to New Eden to have her child. Later, they also pick up Willie, a Marine, who is found hiding in a workmen's toilet after his run-in with The Brotherhood. The four decide to go after Jebedia, whom they successfully ambush then tie to a tree and leave for the vampires. The group is soon reunited with the nun in a survivors settlement but, the same night, celebrations are interrupted when The Brotherhood, using helicopters, drops vampires into town. The next day, the group decides to move on towards the north again. Midway, their car breaks down and they have to continue their journey on foot. They manage to avoid dangerous areas for some time but, while sleeping at the abandoned site of a car jam, they are attacked by stronger vampires known as 'berserkers'. They run into the fields, and the nun diverts the chase away from the rest then shoots herself in the head when overrun. After several days of walk through the wilderness, they take shelter in a broken-down bus and notice in the morning that Willie is missing. The three search for him, first finding his blanket then finding Willie killed and strung up in a tree. Mister notes he has never encountered a thinking vampire before and warns the others to stay alert. Despite their best efforts, Belle is taken from their campsite during the night and Mister and Martin find her in an abandoned silo the following day, suspended from barbed wire and bitten. Jebedia Loven, now a thinking vampire thanks to having given himself willingly to the vampires that attacked him, reveals himself and attacks Martin and then Mister. Martin manages to impale Jebedia, and an injured Mister is successful in finishing him off. Martin mercy kills the dying Belle, saving her from becoming a vampire. The duo then heads north again, acquiring a pickup truck, and they meet Peggy, who lives alone in what once was a roadside restaurant and picks off approaching vampires using a crossbow. Martin and Peggy have an instant connection, and Martin easily attacks and kills a vamp outside the restaurant that night, with Mister covertly looking on. The next day, Mister is gone and Martin finds his mentor's skull pendant hanging from the truck's mirror. He and Peggy head off by themselves, finally arriving at the border to Canada, or the New Eden for which they were searching."

Amudha ([[Ananya , a naive village girl from Trichy, arrives in Chennai for a job interview, but her sister is unable to meet her to direct her to her destination. Amudha enlists the aid of a stranger Gautham , who agrees to take her as far as the bus stop. However, he ends up reluctantly travelling with her the entire day, waiting for her during her interview, and finally dropping her at her sister's home in the evening. In the course of the day, she comes to understand him as a person and becomes fond of him, and, while remaining calm and reserved, Gautham too reciprocates her feelings. The following day Amudha returns to Trichy, where she realizes she has fallen in love with him and rejects marriage proposals that come her way. She eventually decides to return to Chennai to meet him. Meanwhile, Gautham realizes that he has fallen in love with Amudha and decides to go to Trichy to find her despite not knowing her address and other any details except her name. A parallel story follows. Kathiresan ([[Jai , a metal shop worker, harbors feelings towards his neighbor Manimegalai ([[Anjali , a nurse. Being shy and soft-spoken, he doesn't talk to her, but continues to watch her every morning for six months. Manimegalai, however, is bold and forthcoming; she agrees to his love and orders him around mercilessly. She puts him through several tests- having him meet her father , her former one-side lover on his own, makes him undergo an HIV test, and gets him to agree to organ donation. She wants him to decide on the basis of all that she's put him through as to whether he wants to marry her and spend the rest of his life with her; Kathiresan responds affirmatively. The two grow to love each other unconditionally with the consent of their families. Kathiresan decides to take Manimegalai to visit his family in Arasur, a village near Villupuram, and the two board a bus to take them there. Meanwhile, Gautham boards a bus to return from Trichy - the same one that Kathiresan and Manimegalai are travelling in. Simultaneously, Amudha boards a bus to return from Chennai. Few glimpses of other passengers are also seen: a mother and her child, a girls' athletic team, a newly married couple, two college students who are attracted to each other, and a man returning from Dubai to see his five year-old daughter for the first time. At a distance from Villupuram, on the Chennai-Trichy highway, both the buses collide head-on, killing about 35 people on the spot. Many others die en route to the hospital or at the hospital. Gautham sees Amudha, severely injured, on the other bus and she is rushed to a hospital. Manimegalai stays at the scene to help the wounded. By the time she reaches the hospital along with Gautham, Kathiresan has already succumbed to head trauma. At the hospital, Gautham confesses his love to Amudha at her bedside, and she manages to regain consciousness. Kathiresan's body is taken away by a hysteric Manimegalai and his grieving parents. The site of the crash is declared an accident prone-area, and the film ends with a message on road safety.

Before she leaves, her Aunt Ella  tells her she will succeed beyond her wildest dreams if only she never lies, is always fair, and never breaks a promise. As she prepares to board the bus, Aunt Ella gifts her with a locket containing a picture of her mother and a one-hundred dollar bill, ""so you can always come home."" In Nashville, Bobbie lands a job at a sushi restaurant owned by Morita. Morita believes that anyone who is aspiring to be in the music business will not work hard in his restaurant, so when he asks Bobbie if she is a singer , she responds ""No."" The angels in heaven wince and say ""that's one,"" meaning she's broken the first of the three rules that govern her gift. But it turns out that the other employees are also musicians and have a band called ""The Rising Sons."" She joins their group, Morita becomes their manager, and they are given an audition by a promoter who is a long-time customer at the sushi restaurant. The promoter convinces Bobbie that The Rising Sons are not talented enough to take her to the top. Though she repeatedly says, ""it's not fair,"" she eventually gives in and agrees to let them go. The angels in heaven say ""that's two,"" meaning she's broken the second of the rules. Bobbie grew up not knowing her father and has always wondered about him. When her single climbs the charts and she is interviewed on a television show, the host surprises her by bringing her long-lost father on the show with her. Later, he confesses to Bobbie that he's led a hard life and she'd be better off without him. At that point, she promises to always stand by him, no matter what. As Bobbie prepares for a live show, her drunken father comes into her dressing room . After exchanging harsh words, Bobbie tells him she hates him, wishes she'd never met him, and tells him to get out. She has, sadly, broken the third rule - never break a promise. As she heads out on stage, a strong wind blows and takes her voice - her gift - away with it. When Bobbie opens her mouth to sing, only a hoarse noise issues forth. She runs from the stage. Bobbie visits expert after expert to try to get her voice back. She is told, more than once, that because of the way her larynx is formed, she should never have been able to sing. Her ability to sing at all was a miracle. The experts all agree that she will never sing again. Bobbie goes back home to Aunt Ella, and says she's lost her voice.  Bobbie cries because singing is all she's ever done, ever wanted to do. Aunt Ella tells her that when she makes up for the wrongs she did, she'll be able to sing again. She tells Bobbie that her heart is empty, but when it is full, Bobbie will sing from her heart. It won't sound the same as when she sang from the gift, but she will sing. Shortly after, Aunt Ella passes away. Then, Bobbie sets out to right the wrongs she did. She returns to Nashville, and seeks and receives forgiveness from Morita and the Rising Sons. She arranges a charity performance to support a horse-therapy group.  She is called to the stage and says, ""I hope you'll forgive the sound of my voice, but I'm singing from my heart. So please just listen to my heart."" Meanwhile, in Heaven, the gift is dancing and twirling around the angels, who have never seen that happen before. Then, a new angel tells them that Bobbie has redeemed herself and the gift should be returned to her. Halfway through the song, the angels send the gift hurtling back to her. Bobbie's voice returns to its former glory."

During work on the film, the plot was subjected to a major reworking: in contrast to the novel, the story of which ends at the end of the 1990s, the film is brought into the present day and even extended slightly into the future. The film is also in many respects built on hallucinations, including a speech by Che Guevara concerning how and why television is destroying humankind.

At 2:30 AM, Killer Bean is at a nearby hotel trying to sleep, and makes a phone call asking them to turn down the music. The gangsters refuse, and Killer Bean confronts them. After the gangsters fire a shot at Killer Bean and miss, Killer Bean ends up killing every one of the gangsters. The last bean killed is revealed to be the nephew of Cappuccino, a mob boss.{{cite web}} The police, led by Detective Cromwell, investigate the warehouse shootings. The warehouse is known to be owned by Cappuccino. As the police investigate, Vegan, a lieutenant of Cappuccino arrives at the warehouse. After discovering the massacre, Vegan, who runs guns for Cappuccino, quickly informs his boss what has happened and that Cappuccino is Killer Bean's next target. Due to Killer Bean's skill, Vegan suggests hiring mercenary soldiers to kill him. Killer Bean receives an encrypted call from his boss warning him that he is being reckless and that the attack on the warehouse should have never happened, and that only the ""target"" should be killed. Killer Bean ensures his boss that the mission will succeed. Killer Bean goes to another of Cappuccino's warehouses but instead finds Vegan there, who attempts to kill him. The fight between Vegan and Killer Bean ends as a draw. Vegan leaves a note to Killer Bean which reads, ""Shadow Bean, you are too late"". Killer Bean later goes to a bar across the street where Detective Cromwell finds him. Cromwell suggests they work together to bring Cappuccino down, but Killer Bean refuses his help. Later, Cromwell finds the note referencing the ""Shadow Beans"". After a call to police intelligence, Cromwell discovers that the Shadow Beans were a private organization that carried out secret government operations, but disbanded years ago. Killer Bean locates a third warehouse, evidently attempting to find Cappuccino there. After killing the gangsters there, Killer Bean is confronted by mercenaries hired by Vegan. The mercenaries fail, but afterwards Vegan is able to capture Killer Bean. Cappuccino interrogates Killer Bean asking him why he wants to kill him, but receives no answers. Killer Bean escapes, and then reveals that he is not after Cappuccino, but rather after Vegan. Cappuccino is then shot by Vegan. Killer Bean explains that he has been sent to kill Vegan, a former Shadow Bean whose code name is Dark Bean. Dark Bean had betrayed the Shadow Agency and had stolen their secret database. Dark Bean then explains that the Shadow Agency had degenerated from an honorable agency into simply guns for hire, and that he was ordered to supply weapons to criminals. Dark Bean claims to have left the Shadow Agency and run guns for Cappuccino so that he could be knowledgeable of all weapon transfers, and thus could fight crime. Killer Bean doesn't believe him, and kills Dark Bean as he attempts to shoot Killer Bean first. Detective Cromwell witnesses the entire fight, and orders the entire police department to capture Killer Bean. Killer Bean gives up, assuming that only the police can protect him from the Shadow Agency, and presumably because he would have to kill police officers. Meanwhile, the Shadow Agency has dispatched another Shadow Bean named Jet Bean to kill Killer Bean. Jet Bean, an assassin from the east, is one of the Shadow Agency's top Shadow Beans. Killer Bean is taken to prison, but Jet Bean manages to kill every police officer and find him in his cell. Killer Bean explains to Jet Bean that the Shadow Agency has gone criminal, but Jet Bean doesn't believe him. In the last fight scene, Killer Bean kills Jet Bean with much effort. Killer Bean then contacts the Shadow Agency on Jet Bean's cell phone, and they suggest Killer Bean come in to ""talk things over"". Killer Bean says he will come in, but it won't be for talk. The film ends with Killer Bean finding a cache of police weapons, and driving off to confront the Shadow Agency."

It is a past that he shares not only with his extended family, but also with successive generations of India’s rural population. Armed with a cranky digital camera, he and his friend Ajay Raina sets out to document the dismantling process. They meet the four owners of the house – the uncles and aunt of the filmmaker - and gather from them what it means to undergo the process of change and migration. A sense of nostalgia and loss; as well as the excitement and the insecurity of the future accompany this process; the essence of which is transition. A realization of the inevitability of this transition marks this journey. It could well have been the journey of a country that has propelled itself into modernity. As plans are on for the house to get reconstructed elsewhere in an open air museum, out of its original context – for the filmmaker, the fossilization seems to be complete.

They learn that Kate's brother Andy  was smuggling drugs, but dropped them into the Mississippi River during a surprise inspection by U.S. Customs. Andy's boss, ruthless mobster Tim Briggs , threatens to kill Chris' family if Andy doesn't pay $700,000. Chris decides to raise the money by running contraband, working with his best friend and former smuggling partner, Sebastian Abney ([[Ben Foster , who has also gone legit and now owns a construction company. He promises Kate that he will not run drugs, joining the crew of a cargo ship in order to buy $10,000,000 in fake bills in Panama and smuggle them into the U.S. He is joined by Andy, good friend Danny Raymer , and gets help from fellow crew mates. Briggs breaks into Chris's house to scare his wife and kids, so they move into Sebastian's house for safety. In Panama, Chris discovers that the bills are of poor quality and refuses to accept them. The only one who can provide good ones is crime lord Gonzalo . While Chris and Danny negotiate with Gonzalo, Briggs calls Andy and threatens to kill one of Chris' sons if Andy doesn't immediately take Chris' money and use it to buy cocaine. Gonzalo lets Chris and Danny help in a dangerous armored car heist as payment for the fake bills. They are successful in stealing a paint splattered tarp in the heist, but Gonzalo and his men are killed in a firefight with the police. Chris and Danny make it back to the ship yard in a van containing the fake bills and the tarp. They load the contraband-laden van into a container which is loaded onto their cargo ship. Chris assaults Andy for stealing the money and buying cocaine. It is revealed that Sebastian has been working with Briggs, as gangster Jim Church  threatens to kill Sebastian if he doesn't repay money he borrowed to save his fledgling construction business. When Sebastian calls Chris, Chris tells him that he might drop the drugs Andy bought into the ocean. Sebastian tells Briggs, who assaults Kate and warns her to tell Chris to not dump the ""package"". Kate calls Chris and tells him what Briggs said to her. Chris is surprised that Briggs knew about dumping the drugs, realizing that Sebastian had to have told him. Kate does not know and goes back to Sebastian's apartment to retrieve some personal items. When Sebastian tries to force himself on her, Kate runs to the bathroom. Sebastian breaks the door open, sending Kate flying and bashing her head against the tub. Sebastian thinks she is dead and panics, wraps her in plastic, and throws Kate's unconscious body in a yet to be poured foundation. Sebastian contacts the cargo ship's Captain Camp , tells him that Chris is smuggling on his ship, and promises him a share if he makes sure Chris doesn't throw it overboard. When Chris does not give up the contraband, Camp calls U.S. Customs to meet the ship in New Orleans. The Customs Agents do not find anything other than the van, containing only the paint splattered tarp. Briggs and his thugs force Chris to take them to the drugs. Chris takes Briggs to Camp's house, having made a duplicate key while on the ship, and knowingly activates the security system. Chris opens Camp's personal carpet cleaner, which the Captain had aboard the ship, and retrieves the cocaine from the carpet cleaner's water tank. While Briggs and his gang sit in Camp's living room with the cocaine, Chris sneaks out in Camp's car. Camp awakens to the noise and comes into the living room as the police arrive. Both Briggs and Camp are arrested. Chris goes to Sebastian's construction site and brutally beats him, demanding Kate's location. When Sebastian tells Chris that she's dead, he tries calling her cellphone and hears the ringtone in a building foundation where cement is being poured and rescues her. Sebastian is arrested and sent to prison. Danny retrieves the fake bills, which we learn Chris had dumped into the Mississippi River before docking in New Orleans. Andy buys the escape van, still containing the tarp, at a police auction. Church pays Chris $3 million for the fake currency. and asks if he knows anything about a Jackson Pollock painting stolen from an armored car in Panama, telling him that it's worth over $20 million on the black market. Chris, Andy and Danny find the tarp/painting still in the van, having gone unnoticed. The film ends with Chris and his family in a waterfront house."

When he awakes the camera focuses on everyday scenes in the dismal Adelaide suburb of Salisbury North, and shows Jamie's dull and uneventful life, in which his distressed mother Elizabeth  looks after his younger brothers, and he lacks a father figure. One day his mother's boyfriend takes indecent photographs of the boys and since the police are reluctant to intervene, Elizabeth is contacted by Barry , a gay man who introduces her to John . John, who despises paedophiles and homosexuals, deals with the boyfriend by continually harassing him until he is forced to leave the town, in which time he assumes the role of Jamie's father figure. As Jamie befriends John, he is slowly drawn into his homophobic and violent tendencies, and soon realises that he is within John's control, unable to escape because of his charismatic and intimidating dominance. John meanwhile influences the rest of the neighbourhood with his extremely homophobic views, and separates Barry from his younger boyfriend Robert . Barry is not seen again in the suburb, leaving behind only a tape telling his brother that he is going to Queensland. Shortly afterward, Jamie visits his drug-addicted best friend Gavin  with John, who takes a disliking to him. Later one night John and Robert take Jamie into his garden shed and show him the bodies of Barry and Gavin. Distressed, Jamie lashes out at John but is powerless to resist, and remains under his influence. John learns that Jamie was abused by his half-brother Troy , and tells Jamie that he will take revenge on him. He drags Troy out of bed one morning and proceeds to torture Troy, after handcuffing him to a rail affixed to the wall. Jamie is then presented with the brutal aftermath of the torture, at which point Troy is partly strangled. Jamie then takes over the killing, in an act of mercy, to spare him from any further pain by quickening death. After this event Jamie has become increasingly desensitised, and assists John in carrying out several murders. John and his team dump the bodies in the vault of the abandoned bank, used as a computer storeroom, in the desolate village of Snowtown. Jamie is later persuaded by John to lure his half-brother Dave  to look at a computer that is for sale being kept in the Snowtown bank. Jamie drives with him to the town, vaguely conscious of what he is doing, and takes Dave into the building, where he is met by John and Robert. Unaware of what is going on, Dave sees Jamie shut the door of the bank as the screen fades to black. A title card appears telling the viewer that on 20 May 1999, South Australian Police discovered the remains of eight people stored in barrels in the bank vault of Snowtown, and that the following day John Bunting and Robert Wagner were arrested, and shows the fate of them and of Jamie Vlassakis after the trial.

At a laboratory only a few miles away, a mad scientist completes construction of a robot and activates it. To the his surprise, the robot began swinging punches at him. The mad scientist, however, is able to evade the attacks and stops the humanoid machine with a punch of his own. He soon learns that his creation needed one more thing, a heart. Back in Oswald's place, the two friends decided to play hide-and-seek. Oswald was ""it"" and the doll became the one to hide. While the rabbit counts, his playmate has yet to look for a hiding place. Without a warning, the doll gets captured through an opened window by the mad scientist who then leaves a sack inside before fleeing. Convinced that the doll was hiding in the bag, Oswald approach and opens it. To his amusement, what comes out was a marching flute player. As the rabbit goes to find his friend, he notices a strand of thread on the window sill which he follows. The thread is fact the trousers of the mad scientist who will later appear in spotted shorts. At the laboratory, the mad scientist has the doll wedged in a vise and attempts to perform surgery on her, i.e. take out her heart and place it in the robot. But before he could start, the nefarious inventor sees through his surveillance device that someone came to his facility. Oswald reaches just outside of the laboratory after the following the whole thread. Upon knocking on the door, a trap activates, causing him to fall into a shoot, leading towards the basement. In an attempt to slaughter Oswald, the mad scientist waits for the little rabbit's arrival at other end of the shoot, preparing to swing an ax. The mad scientist swings but misses. From there, the chase begins. Oswald runs through several corridors of the laboratory. While approaching an intersection, he sees something white popping in and out of the left corner. For his defense, Oswald picks up a nearby urn. There was indeed a skeleton innocently sitting on a rocking chair by the left corner, but the mad scientist, who was coming from the corridor in that direction, pulls it away, and walks into the intersection. Upon seeing what entered his hallway, Oswald tosses the urn. The mad scientist was strucked right in head and was knocked cold. Oswald finds a rope and ties one end of it around his pursuer's leg, with the other end around a lion's tail. The lion runs in place, hanging the mad scientist above the floor. Oswald, at last, found the chamber where the doll was held. He loosens the vise and frees her."

He then proceeds to hand it over to his henchman Somu, ordering it to be killed. But the queen gives birth to twins and the king , ever suspicious of Naganathan, passes an order that forces Naganathan to take care of this baby. But he decides to raise it as his hand puppet.

She moves from Los Angeles to Mumbai, where she meets KC  at a party her parents forcefully take her to. KC introduces her to his gang &mdash; Dash , Zubin  and Tanya . They lead a directionless life, having fun, drinking, using drugs and driving around in a Hummer. On one such occasion, they start racing a random car and win but, in the celebration rush, they run over two people on a scooter killing them instantly. They quickly leave the spot but are easily traced down by a slimy cop, Inspector Malwankar, who demands Rupees 25 lakhs to make the case go away. Dash tells them about a friend  who faked his own brother's kidnapping and pulled out 20 lakhs from his own parents. Therefore, they hatch a plot to kidnap Amy, who volunteers. Amy's father immediately approaches Police Commissioner  for help. The Police Commissioner assigns an uptight cop Arvind Mathur  to solve the case unofficially as he is suspended after he throws a corporator from the first floor of his own house for allegedly beating up another woman. Inspector Arvind Mathur is shown having a disturbed married life and nearly divorces his wife. Amy's kidnapping quickly turns into a media circus, which puts pressure on the youngsters who go on a gruesome and disturbing killing spree.

Perhaps even more hopeless. A lack of prospects and a strong sense of inadequacy only darken his mood. Deep in crisis, the young man asks his brother Davide to travel with him to Holland, where he wants to accomplish what his friend Maurizio had so lucidly planned to accomplish: assisted suicide. He confesses that he wants to end it all, he wants to stop being such an outsider, stop the suffering. Davide, who has gotten used to his brother's crises and ravings over the years, doesn't give his requests the least credence. He doesn't know – he cannot know – that Marco's plan has at least a semblance of plausibility. Indeed, the Dutch protocol on euthanasia extends to the category of mental distress. The day after the two of them talk, Marco runs away from the Community where he is living, and takes a train to Amsterdam, intent on completing his desperate mission. At the very moment when he’s trying to save his relationship with Nina, Davide is forced to acknowledge the gravity of the situation and leave for Holland. Tired as she may be of watching what she considers to be a sadistic game, Nina is not prepared to leave Davide to face this crisis alone. The unexpected journey offers an opportunity for the couple to be together again, after a period of separation. On reaching Amsterdam, Marco loses himself in this city of bright lights and attractions. Almost forgetting why he travelled there in the first place, he roams around on a bike, with no particular place to go. He's very much cast adrift, but then he also feels more free than he ever has before. Like a condemned man, he allows itself one last wish: an intimate relationship with a woman – a prostitute. Meanwhile, Davide and Nina have made it to Amsterdam and started to try and find him. One evening, completely by chance, Davide sees his brother streak by on a bicycle. He races after him, and in the end manages to block him near the port. They have a massive argument. Marco has no intention of giving up on his quest, but Davide manages to persuade him that his suicide mission is impracticable. The doctors he has spoken to have told him in no uncertain terms that Marco's condition is not eligible for euthanasia. And even if his condition was eligible, as a foreign citizen he would still not qualify for assisted suicide. Marco has to face the facts and give up. The three of them head home. They fly to Pisa, and then drive the rest of the way to Rome. En route, Davide nods off and they are very lucky not to be involved in a car wreck. Davide decides to turn off the main road and find somewhere to stop and have a snooze. The three of them, all exhausted, fall asleep in the car. A magnificent dawn lights up a desolate and uninhabited stretch of Mediterranean countryside. A passing train wakes Marco. The young man sneaks out of the car.

Here is where the girl first displays her unusual powers: when a member of their party tries to leave the shield to escape the bugs, the girl runs out of the shields and pulls him back in, receiving no injury, although he suffers deadly burns. Also using the computer system, they are able to view old videos which reveal the original scientists who lived here were killed by the bugs. Meanwhile, the terrorist group that attacked their ship has caught up with them and entered the compound. They have also encountered the bugs and decide to form a temporary truce until they can escape this planet. They are after the girl, who reveals her name to be Asta, but do not say why, only hinting that everyone will “understand soon.” While looking for weapons to use against the bugs, a member of their group is attacked by a bug. Asta tries to save him and is injured, only to have completely healed in a matter of seconds. Using the computer system, the team discovers a tunnel to another compound which still has a ship they can use to escape, but when they try to use the tunnels, they are overwhelmed by the bugs. Lei, mortally wounded, sacrifices himself by overloading his pistol, causing a small explosion. The team discovers another of the girl’s powers when she is able to create an energy shield to protect them from the blast. Using the computer, they decide to take their chances and run to the other compound in between solar flares. Along the way, the terrorists reveal why this girl is so important to them. According to the government, a human colony of over a million people on the planet Centauri III was completely wiped out by a massive solar flare. These terrorists claim that it was no solar flare. They say that the colony was a group of rebels who did not want to be under the control of the government, so they were wiped out, leaving Asta as the sole survivor. Asta remembers none of this. By the time the team arrives at the other compound, only four people remain: Ty, Asta, one of the terrorists and a woman from the original transport ship named Janessa . Using the computers in the new compound, they discover what these installations were originally constructed for: to create a thermonuclear weapon to mimic the radiation signature of a solar flare to use on the citizens of Centauri III . Watching the video, the team also discovers that the bugs they have been battling are the descendants of stowaway Earth bugs that evolved under the solar activity of this planet. Upon this discovery, Asta’s memory completely returns. She remembers the attack on her planet as a child and the military Colonel Bishop who found her and left her there to die in the radiation. With Asta’s memory restored, her full powers are unleashed and she creates an energy beam to fight off the bugs. Only three make it off the planet: Asta, Janessa, and Ty, who has promised to take Asta to the terrorist group in the outskirts. Meanwhile, Colonel Bishop, who has been following Ty’s progress ever since he found out the ship disappeared, has caught up to them. Janessa is revealed to be Bishop’s secret operative, stunning Ty and attempting to kidnap Asta to bring her on board Bishop’s ship. Asta overpowers her, but decides to go to Bishop anyway, seeking answers. Bishop reveals that the inhabitants of Centauri III were being “changed” by the solar flares of their sun. They were developing psychic and telekinetic powers; “the next step in human evolution.” This is why they were killed, not because of their political beliefs. Asta leaves him alive, telling him of her plans to expose the truth with the videos they downloaded from the compound’s computers. Asta wakes Ty and they escape, crippling Bishop’s ship in the process. They are forced to crash land on the same planet the others have just escaped from, surrounded by the bugs. The movie ends as Asta and Ty plan to tell the world about Centauri III before heading to the outskirts, as they promised."

He parks his car at a sidewalk by the place and goes toward the entrance. Before he reaches the door, Oswald was flagged down by the bellhop who tells him that parking in the sidewalk was not permitted. As a solution, Oswald compressed his car with his hands until it was hand-sized. The rabbit drops the tiny vehicle in his shorts and gives the bellhop a raspberry, and carried on. Coming to the night club also was a large wolf. Holding onto the wolf's garments is his cub who refuses to be left out. Frustrated by the persistent holding, the wolf puts his offspring inside large pyjamas and hangs it on a light post. The wolf cub was able to come out of the pyjamas but was saddened upon losing sight of his father. He came to the night club's entrance and asked ""Is my father in there?"" A voice from inside tells him not to stay by the doors. The wolf cub would asked the same question to a number of people but would never get the answer he wanted. Inside the night club, the patrons are dancing as the musicians play a tune of Alexander's Ragtime Band. Everyone appears to be having a pleasant time, especially Oswald who stood on a chair, rocking it back and forth. Next to him was a bull who was doing similar moves on a table. The next event featured four dogs in tuxedos who sang part of the song Sweet Adeline on stage. However, their performance wasn't well received by the guests. Still enjoying the atmosphere nonetheless, Oswald dances on his table. Sitting by and sharing that table was the large wolf who came in minutes after him. As he dances, the rabbit accidentally kicks the wolf in the nose, much to the latter's disturbance. The wolf then grabs Oswald's head and rips it off his body. Miraculously, Oswald survives and was able to put himself back together. As retribution, Oswald strikingly puts a jar all over the wolf's head. While the wolf tries to take the jar off his head, a cow laughs at him. In this, the wolf kicks the cow, who in turn, gets laughed at by a mouse. The cow spits at the mouse who then gets laughed at by an elephant. The mouse pulls the elephant's trunk and lets go, causing that animal to dropped on the others. As a result, everyone went into a frenzy. Some patrons were able to flee the but the rest remained in the trouble. A police car arrives at the scene and takes the whole night club building away. Knowing his father is still inside, the wolf cub tries to follow the moving building but couldn't keep up. As he stops, he comes across an opaque telephone booth at a park. The wolf cub asked his question but only received silence. Desperate, the little wolf rips open the booth. In turns out that what's inside was a Tibetan man making a phone call.  The wolf cub's quote ""Is my father in there?"" would later be used two later cartoons produced by Lantz. It was inspired by short films and other media published several years earlier which used similar words. Back then, women and youngsters had to enter taverns through a door other than the main one. They also had to be served in separate tables.{{cite web}}"

Because he is found wearing a Confederate States Army outfit, Jeremy , a young boy is also forced to make the crossing. If they make it across the minefield the Union Army 44th will set them free. Only Jeremy and his mother  - who runs to save him - survive, despite the fact that the mother has stepped on a mine. Jeremy exhibits unearthly powers. Jump to circa 1985 and a platoon of soldiers are out on manouevres in the same backwoods. They too are the 44th, descendants of the Union platoon of years before, those who committed the atrocities. The main character here is Pvt. Ellis , the only soldier to catch glimpses of the beautiful and mysterious Melanie; Ellis also has a romantic interest in Pvt. Lejune . The platoon decide to camp inside a circle of yellow grass seemingly caused by brush fire, a spot from which the wind only blows outward. Pvt. Ellis is reluctant to camp there, but Sgt. Hawkins does not like having her authority undermined. Whilst the platoon are setting up camp, Melanie reappears - this time witnessed by all in the platoon - and takes a strong interest in Pvt. Ellis who bears an uncanny resemblance to her husband, Evan. Trouble for Sgt. Hawkins  and her platoon begins with the soldiers' drunken and childish antics; however, events take a sinister turn when Pvt. Cort  is found shot in the head. They inexplicably lose radio contact and the nearest town is over twenty miles away. Hawkins and her platoon go in search of - and arrest - Melanie, who lives in an old wooden shack with what looks to be her father or grandfather, a withered old man. In the cabin they discover the relics of muskets and an old diary, written by Evan. They take Melanie back to camp, but leave the old man at the cabin; he is too old and frail to go anywhere. During the night, an eerie fog rolls in, encompassing the 44th, and the Confederate Dead close in on their camp. Most of the 44th are subsequently killed - one-by-one - whilst Pvt. Ellis heads off into the woods in search of the old man who, it turns out, is Jeremy . Along the way he is forced to do battle with the Confederate zombies and also runs into Melanie, who shows him a locket. Inside is a picture of Evan and Ellis immediately recognizes the resemblance. He snatches the locket from around her neck and runs in the direction of the cabin. Once there he persuades Jeremy to end the evil spell and send Melanie and the zombies back to wherever it is the dead are supposed go. Exhausted, Jeremy dies and Ellis returns to the camp where Lejune and Hawkins are waiting, the only survivors. Ellis embraces Lejune and the locket falls from his hand to the woodland floor, where it is lost amongst the leaves.Lee-Williams, Matt: Supernaturals, The, Synopsis, Amazon [accessed] April 28, 2011.

His appearance , being rather atypical for a Korean is to blame it seems, but best buddy Yong-cheol persuades Tae-sik to make better use of these disadvantages: Desperate and having nothing better to do, he adopts a strange accent and ethnic hat and is reborn as Bang-ga  from Bhutan, and immediately lands a job at a chair manufacturing factory. Despite a shaky beginning ― due to his unredeemable clumsiness, rather than doubts about his alleged Bhutani roots that are all too convincing ― Tae-sik gets along with his co-workers, and even starts romancing the lovely Jang-mi from Vietnam. He is even voted to become president of a migrant workers labor union and competent Korean language instructor, and joins in a harmonious effort to win a local singing competition for foreigners.

Jim is still married to Michelle  and they now have a two-year-old son, Evan. However, since the birth of their son, Jim and Michelle's sex life has slowly but surely begun to deteriorate. Oz is an NFL sportscaster living in Los Angeles with his supermodel girlfriend Mia . Kevin is married to Ellie and works from home as an architect. Finch tells his friends that he has been traveling the world, and still searching for his one true love. Stifler works as a temp at an investment firm, where he is also the victim of cruel verbal abuse by his arrogant employer. When former classmate John , one half of the 'MILF' duo, organizes a Class of 1999 high school reunion in East Great Falls, Jim and Michelle arrive at Jim's old home, where his father Noah  is now a widower. Jim encounters his neighbor Kara , who he used to babysit and is soon to turn 18. Jim meets up with Oz, Kevin and Finch at a bar, where they meet Selena Vega , a former classmate and Michelle's best friend from band. Stifler unknowingly happens across the group, and joins them for weekend activities. The next day, the group goes to the beach. Oz meets his high school girlfriend, Heather , who is dating a heart surgeon named Ron , while Kevin reconnects with Vicky . The guys have an altercation with Kara's boyfriend A.J.  and his friends, which ends with Stifler defecating in their beer cooler and destroying their jet skis. That night, the guys and girls, minus Michelle, go to the falls where they encounter a high school party celebrating Kara's birthday. Finch and Selena reconnect and realize how much they have in common, thus falling in love with one another. Jim is forced to drive an intoxicated Kara home, who tries to seduce him. They are almost caught by John, but he thinks Michelle was giving Jim oral sex , and dismisses it. Oz, Finch, and Stifler come help Jim secretly return Kara back home past her parents, but A.J. spots them sneaking out. A hungover Kevin wakes up in a bed next to Vicky in his boxers and assumes they had sex. The next day, Stifler tries to throw a party like in high school, but finds everyone else has outgrown this. Jim and Michelle, who have been having a lackluster sex life, attend with a plan to recreate their prom night. They bring Noah along to help him out of his depression, who becomes intoxicated and encounters Stifler's mother Jeanine  for the first time. Kevin confronts Vicky about the night before, but she discloses it was not sexual and is upset that he would assume such a thing. Mia takes ecstasy while Ron humiliates Oz by showing a DVD of his loss as a contestant on Celebrity Dance-Off. When Heather goes to comfort Oz, they attempt to rekindle their previous relationship, but are interrupted by Mia, who gets in a fight with Heather. Jim and Michelle decide to role play, but Jim is confronted by Kara trying again to seduce him, followed by hostile A.J. and his friends. The adults  and the teens have a lengthy fight on the front lawn, which is disrupted by police officers, who arrest Finch for stealing a motorcycle. Stifler finds Finch's arrest amusing while the others sympathize with Finch, and fed up with Stifler's rudeness, the guys proceed to tell him off. Stifler, in response, cites how they never contact him and failed to tell him they were in town. They admit they did not because they did not want him to ruin things like he always does. Hurt and offended, Stifler ends the party. Mia leaves Oz, Stifler decides to skip the reunion for work, and Michelle goes to her grandmother's. When Jim tells his father about their lack of sex, he is told they need to make time for each other. At the reunion, Finch admits that he is an assistant manager at Staples and stole the motorcycle from his boss when he did not receive a raise that was promised. The boys go to Stifler's job, where they apologize to him and admit that although he may be obnoxious, he is their friend, and without him, high school would not have been fun or worthwhile. Stifler regains his confidence and quits his job - but not before standing up to his antagonistic boss - and attends the reunion. Kevin reconciles with Vicky who then meets a new guy at the reunion, Adam, Finch makes amends with Selena for his lies and the two proceed to not only begin a romantic relationship, but have sex in the bathroom (though Finch initially objected to it, still remembering the laxative incident from the [[American Pie , Oz reunites with Heather, and Jim reconciles with Michelle. Stifler is asked to be a party planner for a wedding for his former lacrosse mates and meets Finch's mother Rachel  who proceeds to have sex with him on the lacrosse field. As this goes on, John is reunited with his estranged buddy, Justin  and together they look on and chant their signature word 'MILF' over and over again. The next morning, the friends gather at Dog Years, where Jim encounters Kara and both apologize for their behavior. Oz plans to stay in town with Heather, Finch plans a trip with Selena to Europe, Stifler drops subtle hints about sleeping with Rachel but no one catches on. Jim initiates a pact for them to try and get together once a year to catch up. They all agree and make a toast  as the franchise's theme song ""Laid"" plays."

After following the steps in a dark magic book, he summons the crippled demon Lo , who is less than impressed with Justin and insists on calling him dinner and heavily implying that he will be eaten if he leaves the pentagram. Justin quickly tells Lo the he used the ritual to be able to order a demon to search Hell for his girlfriend April , whom he insists was taken by a demon . Lo becomes angered not only by the demand but the fact that there are countless billions of people in Hell and finding April would be an impossible task. Undeterred, Justin orders Lo to search anyway. Conceding, Lo asks about April so that finding her would be easier. As Justin begins to recount their first meeting, Lo projects the memory onto a wall so he can watch. Lo notes that during the meeting April was both odd and that she gave Justin a fake name when she had to think what her name was. As the flashback ends another demon arrives, Jeez, who Justin identifies as the demon who took April and injured him. Jeez flat out refuses to return April on the grounds that it was Lo that was summoned, making Justin the master of only Lo and unable to control Jeez. Jeez remarks that the only reason for its presence was to see ""the mortal who tamed the beast"", a sentence that confuses Justin at first. Jeez explains that he has felt many emotions towards a human, but never love, making him confused as to why ""It"" fell in love with Justin. Jeez then says the Justin refers to it as April. Jeez then begins to tell the story of a demon who wandered a human battle field until stumbling upon a dying soldier. The demon then ripped out the soldiers heart and used it to create another demon, one who slaughtered many people without distinction, even being considered by Jeez to be one of the best killers in Hell. Later, the new demon abandons her blood lust in favour of love with a man . Justin refuses to believe that April is a demon, despite insistence from Lo and Jeez, assuming they are trying to trick him. Lo pretends to be offended that it brought Jeez, the demon who took April, and was called a liar, revealing to Justin that it knew about April from the start. Justin says he is disgusted, a remark that Lo sees as reason to remind him that April is a demon, therefore is just as bad as it, as all are evil and violent. Lo goes on to state that her love for Justin may have been fake, commenting that her emotions changed frequently, turning from a killer to an emotional wreck who Lo couldn't understand. After insinuating that Lo is too weak to bring April back, Lo leaves in anger. While alone, Justin realizes the cut he made on his hand to summon Lo has begun to say his thoughts out loud. Justin begins to argue with his hand about what he thinks and what he doesn't want to think about, such as the fact that April must have been a demon as she had a book on demon summoning which could have only come from Hell. This train of thoughts leads him to question if April ever loved him or if he was just one of her phases. Lo returns, finding the argument amusing. Lo tells Justin that April is in ""lock up"" but has instead brought two souls from Hell to describe the tortures they endure. Lo explains that it is how all demons operate, including April. The souls are revealed to be a couple who made a deal with April in order to conceive a child, a child which later died. Lo jokingly says that this is what it means to tell someone to ""go to hell"". Lo once again states that he can't retrieve April, going as far as to say it has nothing to do with being crippled. Lo goes on to say that his legs were crushed when April returned to Hell . Lo asks Justin if he would still want to see April, despite all he has learned about her. Justin responds that he can't tell as he wasn't sure if any of what he was told is real. Lo simply tells him to think about her if he wants to see her again, beginning another flashback, this time of their first Christmas together. Justin hands April a present which she unwraps to show the book of Faust. Justin tells her that since she had an ""old book"" she might like the book. April seems confused about the concept that he got her a gift on the basis that he thought she might like it. She becomes excited about the prospect of reading it as she had never read a book before, a slip of the tongue she quickly covers up. Upon asking what the book is about, April finds Faust to be stupid as he sold his soul for knowledge which she seems to know isn't in Hell, another mistake she covers up. Justin accepts it as her being quirky and doesn't seem to notice. April becomes confused when Justin asks what she got him, not understanding the celebration of Christmas and becomes upset when she realizes that he expected a gift as well. However, this is quickly laid to rest as Justin says it doesn't matter. Realizing that she only has one thing to give as a gift, April gives him her book on demon summoning, which she explicitly tells him not to open and to burn it if she ever leaves. As the flashback ends, Lo points out that it seems obvious she was a demon. The cut on Justin's hand begins to talk again, questioning April's trust in him and implying that she was using him, and he made it easy to do so. Justin proceeds to hit his hand to silence it. Lo tells Justin that his condition will only worsen the longer he stays in the circle and that he should undo the spell and leave. A waiter  then appears and offers Justin a drink. Lo tells him that Justin that the drink will allow Justin to travel though Hell, which is his only option as April can't be moved. Lo asks him if April is worth going to Hell for and Justin decides to drink the cocktail, an act that causes Lo to laugh uncontrollably before telling him it was poison. Lo leaves before Jeez arrives, telling Justin that it's a slow-acting poison that can be stopped, but only if he ends the spell, goes to a hospital and gets his stomach pumped. Justin responds by saying that he won't leave without ""her"", a fact that annoys Jeez who tells him that demons are genderless and that April is an ""it"". Out of curiosity, Jeez asks what love is but is surprised to be told that there isn't a set definition for it as it can only be experienced, something Justin notes that Jeez cannot do, a fact that Jeez becomes indignant about and chooses to say he is blessed with not knowing love as he isn't dying like Justin. Justin merely smiles, annoying Jeez to the point of leaving. The hand begins to talk again, this time making the point that it would rather live than die for April. Justin agrees that he doesn't want to die, but wouldn't be able to live without her. The hand then begins to say Justin's ""thoughts"", that the hand would trick him and needed to be cut off. Just as he is about to do so, Lo interrupts him. Justin decides to stop being afraid of Lo and asks it why it was marked out by April out of all the demons in the book, a question that Lo largely ignores. As a second question, Justin asks why Lo helped April leave Hell, a question Lo refuses to answer, even saying that being crippled was a suitable punishment. Lo says that April is vile for falling in love and isn't worth any effort on Justin's part. Justin ignores this on the grounds that who she was on Earth isn't who she was in Hell. Lo remains adamant that she was always the same murderer she was in Hell. Justin responds by forcing a flashback while Lo watches. In the flashback, Justin and April are in bed but are both woken up when she has nightmare. Justin says that her dreams have been getting worse and that she apologizes repeatedly. April suddenly smells sulfur and is attacked by Jeez. Justin tries to help but is slashed across his chest. As he lies dying, April bargains with Jeez to return to Hell as long as she is allowed to save him first, a condition Jeez agrees to. He reminds her to bring the book, but she brings the book of Faust instead, leaving the demon summoning book with Justin. Once the flashback ends, Lo admonishes Justin for not burning the book, saying that not doing so goes against the love that drove him, and that Justin had betrayed his love. Justin becomes digressive with Lo and comes to the conclusion that humans are allowed to make mistakes, while demons get satisfaction from torturing them because they don't have a choice. Lo begins to laugh again, accompanied with other demons, while Justin holds his head in pain. After Lo stops laughing at him, Justin becomes infuriated and shouts at a surprised Lo, reiterating that he is the master and that he has power over Lo. He insinuates that Lo has been appearing in several forms and planting doubts in his mind to make him leave, an act Justin refuses to do. He orders Lo once again to find April in Hell, and then to ""fuck off"". Lo, left speechless, leaves. Once Justin calms down, he looks at a picture of April and begins to cry. Justin looks up to see April in front of him. She notes that he didn't burn the book, something Justin apologizes for as he wasn't able to, but she forgives him. She asks him if he still wants to save her, despite everything he has been told, to which Justin responds that he knows who she really is. Upon seeing that Justin loves her, she tells him to turn to a page in the book and read the spell. After doing so, April is able to enter the pentagram. She kisses Justin, extracting the poison from his body. April tells Justin that she can't go with him as the demons would always find them, putting Justin in danger. Justin offers to stay but April refuses to let him stay in Hell for eternity. Justin simply says that she is the only thing he has in his life, to which April reminds him that she isn't a woman or a human. She tells him once again to burn the book when he leaves, leaving the circle and undoing the spell that allowed her to enter. As April drags herself away, Justin calls after her. Looking back, she becomes Lo, revealing that they were the same person from the start, and that Lo's intention was to deter Justin because it didn't believe it was worth saving. Lo looks back silently and begins to drag itself away again. Justin watches as Lo leaves, not saying a word. The next day Justin is shown in his apartment preparing to burn the book. As he sets it on fire, he watches, ending the film."

He reminds her to bring the book, but she brings the book of Faust instead, leaving the demon summoning book with Justin. Once the flashback ends, Lo admonishes Justin for not burning the book, saying that not doing so goes against the love that drove him, and that Justin had betrayed his love. Justin becomes digressive with Lo and comes to the conclusion that humans are allowed to make mistakes, while demons get satisfaction from torturing them because they don't have a choice. Lo begins to laugh again, accompanied with other demons, while Justin holds his head in pain. After Lo stops laughing at him, Justin becomes infuriated and shouts at a surprised Lo, reiterating that he is the master and that he has power over Lo. He insinuates that Lo has been appearing in several forms and planting doubts in his mind to make him leave, an act Justin refuses to do. He orders Lo once again to find April in Hell, and then to ""fuck off"". Lo, left speechless, leaves. Once Justin calms down, he looks at a picture of April and begins to cry. Justin looks up to see April in front of him. She notes that he didn't burn the book, something Justin apologizes for as he wasn't able to, but she forgives him. She asks him if he still wants to save her, despite everything he has been told, to which Justin responds that he knows who she really is. Upon seeing that Justin loves her, she tells him to turn to a page in the book and read the spell. After doing so, April is able to enter the pentagram. She kisses Justin, extracting the poison from his body. April tells Justin that she can't go with him as the demons would always find them, putting Justin in danger. Justin offers to stay but April refuses to let him stay in Hell for eternity. Justin simply says that she is the only thing he has in his life, to which April reminds him that she isn't a woman or a human. She tells him once again to burn the book when he leaves, leaving the circle and undoing the spell that allowed her to enter. As April drags herself away, Justin calls after her. Looking back, she becomes Lo, revealing that they were the same person from the start, and that Lo's intention was to deter Justin because it didn't believe it was worth saving. Lo looks back silently and begins to drag itself away again. Justin watches as Lo leaves, not saying a word. The next day Justin is shown in his apartment preparing to burn the book. As he sets it on fire, he watches, ending the film."

After following the steps in a dark magic book, he summons the crippled demon Lo , who is less than impressed with Justin and insists on calling him dinner and heavily implying that he will be eaten if he leaves the pentagram. Justin quickly tells Lo the he used the ritual to be able to order a demon to search Hell for his girlfriend April , whom he insists was taken by a demon . Lo becomes angered not only by the demand but the fact that there are countless billions of people in Hell and finding April would be an impossible task. Undeterred, Justin orders Lo to search anyway. Conceding, Lo asks about April so that finding her would be easier. As Justin begins to recount their first meeting, Lo projects the memory onto a wall so he can watch. Lo notes that during the meeting April was both odd and that she gave Justin a fake name when she had to think what her name was. As the flashback ends another demon arrives, Jeez, who Justin identifies as the demon who took April and injured him. Jeez flat out refuses to return April on the grounds that it was Lo that was summoned, making Justin the master of only Lo and unable to control Jeez. Jeez remarks that the only reason for its presence was to see ""the mortal who tamed the beast"", a sentence that confuses Justin at first. Jeez explains that he has felt many emotions towards a human, but never love, making him confused as to why ""It"" fell in love with Justin. Jeez then says the Justin refers to it as April. Jeez then begins to tell the story of a demon who wandered a human battle field until stumbling upon a dying soldier. The demon then ripped out the soldiers heart and used it to create another demon, one who slaughtered many people without distinction, even being considered by Jeez to be one of the best killers in Hell. Later, the new demon abandons her blood lust in favour of love with a man . Justin refuses to believe that April is a demon, despite insistence from Lo and Jeez, assuming they are trying to trick him. Lo pretends to be offended that it brought Jeez, the demon who took April, and was called a liar, revealing to Justin that it knew about April from the start. Justin says he is disgusted, a remark that Lo sees as reason to remind him that April is a demon, therefore is just as bad as it, as all are evil and violent. Lo goes on to state that her love for Justin may have been fake, commenting that her emotions changed frequently, turning from a killer to an emotional wreck who Lo couldn't understand. After insinuating that Lo is too weak to bring April back, Lo leaves in anger. While alone, Justin realizes the cut he made on his hand to summon Lo has begun to say his thoughts out loud. Justin begins to argue with his hand about what he thinks and what he doesn't want to think about, such as the fact that April must have been a demon as she had a book on demon summoning which could have only come from Hell. This train of thoughts leads him to question if April ever loved him or if he was just one of her phases. Lo returns, finding the argument amusing. Lo tells Justin that April is in ""lock up"" but has instead brought two souls from Hell to describe the tortures they endure. Lo explains that it is how all demons operate, including April. The souls are revealed to be a couple who made a deal with April in order to conceive a child, a child which later died. Lo jokingly says that this is what it means to tell someone to ""go to hell"". Lo once again states that he can't retrieve April, going as far as to say it has nothing to do with being crippled. Lo goes on to say that his legs were crushed when April returned to Hell . Lo asks Justin if he would still want to see April, despite all he has learned about her. Justin responds that he can't tell as he wasn't sure if any of what he was told is real. Lo simply tells him to think about her if he wants to see her again, beginning another flashback, this time of their first Christmas together. Justin hands April a present which she unwraps to show the book of Faust. Justin tells her that since she had an ""old book"" she might like the book. April seems confused about the concept that he got her a gift on the basis that he thought she might like it. She becomes excited about the prospect of reading it as she had never read a book before, a slip of the tongue she quickly covers up. Upon asking what the book is about, April finds Faust to be stupid as he sold his soul for knowledge which she seems to know isn't in Hell, another mistake she covers up. Justin accepts it as her being quirky and doesn't seem to notice. April becomes confused when Justin asks what she got him, not understanding the celebration of Christmas and becomes upset when she realizes that he expected a gift as well. However, this is quickly laid to rest as Justin says it doesn't matter. Realizing that she only has one thing to give as a gift, April gives him her book on demon summoning, which she explicitly tells him not to open and to burn it if she ever leaves. As the flashback ends, Lo points out that it seems obvious she was a demon. The cut on Justin's hand begins to talk again, questioning April's trust in him and implying that she was using him, and he made it easy to do so. Justin proceeds to hit his hand to silence it. Lo tells Justin that his condition will only worsen the longer he stays in the circle and that he should undo the spell and leave. A waiter  then appears and offers Justin a drink. Lo tells him that Justin that the drink will allow Justin to travel though Hell, which is his only option as April can't be moved. Lo asks him if April is worth going to Hell for and Justin decides to drink the cocktail, an act that causes Lo to laugh uncontrollably before telling him it was poison. Lo leaves before Jeez arrives, telling Justin that it's a slow-acting poison that can be stopped, but only if he ends the spell, goes to a hospital and gets his stomach pumped. Justin responds by saying that he won't leave without ""her"", a fact that annoys Jeez who tells him that demons are genderless and that April is an ""it"". Out of curiosity, Jeez asks what love is but is surprised to be told that there isn't a set definition for it as it can only be experienced, something Justin notes that Jeez cannot do, a fact that Jeez becomes indignant about and chooses to say he is blessed with not knowing love as he isn't dying like Justin. Justin merely smiles, annoying Jeez to the point of leaving. The hand begins to talk again, this time making the point that it would rather live than die for April. Justin agrees that he doesn't want to die, but wouldn't be able to live without her. The hand then begins to say Justin's ""thoughts"", that the hand would trick him and needed to be cut off. Just as he is about to do so, Lo interrupts him. Justin decides to stop being afraid of Lo and asks it why it was marked out by April out of all the demons in the book, a question that Lo largely ignores. As a second question, Justin asks why Lo helped April leave Hell, a question Lo refuses to answer, even saying that being crippled was a suitable punishment. Lo says that April is vile for falling in love and isn't worth any effort on Justin's part. Justin ignores this on the grounds that who she was on Earth isn't who she was in Hell. Lo remains adamant that she was always the same murderer she was in Hell. Justin responds by forcing a flashback while Lo watches. In the flashback, Justin and April are in bed but are both woken up when she has nightmare. Justin says that her dreams have been getting worse and that she apologizes repeatedly. April suddenly smells sulfur and is attacked by Jeez. Justin tries to help but is slashed across his chest.

After following the steps in a dark magic book, he summons the crippled demon Lo , who is less than impressed with Justin and insists on calling him dinner and heavily implying that he will be eaten if he leaves the pentagram. Justin quickly tells Lo the he used the ritual to be able to order a demon to search Hell for his girlfriend April , whom he insists was taken by a demon . Lo becomes angered not only by the demand but the fact that there are countless billions of people in Hell and finding April would be an impossible task. Undeterred, Justin orders Lo to search anyway. Conceding, Lo asks about April so that finding her would be easier. As Justin begins to recount their first meeting, Lo projects the memory onto a wall so he can watch. Lo notes that during the meeting April was both odd and that she gave Justin a fake name when she had to think what her name was. As the flashback ends another demon arrives, Jeez, who Justin identifies as the demon who took April and injured him. Jeez flat out refuses to return April on the grounds that it was Lo that was summoned, making Justin the master of only Lo and unable to control Jeez. Jeez remarks that the only reason for its presence was to see ""the mortal who tamed the beast"", a sentence that confuses Justin at first. Jeez explains that he has felt many emotions towards a human, but never love, making him confused as to why ""It"" fell in love with Justin. Jeez then says the Justin refers to it as April. Jeez then begins to tell the story of a demon who wandered a human battle field until stumbling upon a dying soldier. The demon then ripped out the soldiers heart and used it to create another demon, one who slaughtered many people without distinction, even being considered by Jeez to be one of the best killers in Hell. Later, the new demon abandons her blood lust in favour of love with a man . Justin refuses to believe that April is a demon, despite insistence from Lo and Jeez, assuming they are trying to trick him. Lo pretends to be offended that it brought Jeez, the demon who took April, and was called a liar, revealing to Justin that it knew about April from the start. Justin says he is disgusted, a remark that Lo sees as reason to remind him that April is a demon, therefore is just as bad as it, as all are evil and violent. Lo goes on to state that her love for Justin may have been fake, commenting that her emotions changed frequently, turning from a killer to an emotional wreck who Lo couldn't understand. After insinuating that Lo is too weak to bring April back, Lo leaves in anger. While alone, Justin realizes the cut he made on his hand to summon Lo has begun to say his thoughts out loud. Justin begins to argue with his hand about what he thinks and what he doesn't want to think about, such as the fact that April must have been a demon as she had a book on demon summoning which could have only come from Hell. This train of thoughts leads him to question if April ever loved him or if he was just one of her phases. Lo returns, finding the argument amusing. Lo tells Justin that April is in ""lock up"" but has instead brought two souls from Hell to describe the tortures they endure. Lo explains that it is how all demons operate, including April. The souls are revealed to be a couple who made a deal with April in order to conceive a child, a child which later died. Lo jokingly says that this is what it means to tell someone to ""go to hell"". Lo once again states that he can't retrieve April, going as far as to say it has nothing to do with being crippled. Lo goes on to say that his legs were crushed when April returned to Hell . Lo asks Justin if he would still want to see April, despite all he has learned about her. Justin responds that he can't tell as he wasn't sure if any of what he was told is real. Lo simply tells him to think about her if he wants to see her again, beginning another flashback, this time of their first Christmas together. Justin hands April a present which she unwraps to show the book of Faust. Justin tells her that since she had an ""old book"" she might like the book. April seems confused about the concept that he got her a gift on the basis that he thought she might like it. She becomes excited about the prospect of reading it as she had never read a book before, a slip of the tongue she quickly covers up. Upon asking what the book is about, April finds Faust to be stupid as he sold his soul for knowledge which she seems to know isn't in Hell, another mistake she covers up. Justin accepts it as her being quirky and doesn't seem to notice. April becomes confused when Justin asks what she got him, not understanding the celebration of Christmas and becomes upset when she realizes that he expected a gift as well. However, this is quickly laid to rest as Justin says it doesn't matter. Realizing that she only has one thing to give as a gift, April gives him her book on demon summoning, which she explicitly tells him not to open and to burn it if she ever leaves. As the flashback ends, Lo points out that it seems obvious she was a demon. The cut on Justin's hand begins to talk again, questioning April's trust in him and implying that she was using him, and he made it easy to do so. Justin proceeds to hit his hand to silence it. Lo tells Justin that his condition will only worsen the longer he stays in the circle and that he should undo the spell and leave. A waiter  then appears and offers Justin a drink. Lo tells him that Justin that the drink will allow Justin to travel though Hell, which is his only option as April can't be moved. Lo asks him if April is worth going to Hell for and Justin decides to drink the cocktail, an act that causes Lo to laugh uncontrollably before telling him it was poison. Lo leaves before Jeez arrives, telling Justin that it's a slow-acting poison that can be stopped, but only if he ends the spell, goes to a hospital and gets his stomach pumped. Justin responds by saying that he won't leave without ""her"", a fact that annoys Jeez who tells him that demons are genderless and that April is an ""it"". Out of curiosity, Jeez asks what love is but is surprised to be told that there isn't a set definition for it as it can only be experienced, something Justin notes that Jeez cannot do, a fact that Jeez becomes indignant about and chooses to say he is blessed with not knowing love as he isn't dying like Justin. Justin merely smiles, annoying Jeez to the point of leaving. The hand begins to talk again, this time making the point that it would rather live than die for April. Justin agrees that he doesn't want to die, but wouldn't be able to live without her. The hand then begins to say Justin's ""thoughts"", that the hand would trick him and needed to be cut off. Just as he is about to do so, Lo interrupts him. Justin decides to stop being afraid of Lo and asks it why it was marked out by April out of all the demons in the book, a question that Lo largely ignores. As a second question, Justin asks why Lo helped April leave Hell, a question Lo refuses to answer, even saying that being crippled was a suitable punishment. Lo says that April is vile for falling in love and isn't worth any effort on Justin's part. Justin ignores this on the grounds that who she was on Earth isn't who she was in Hell. Lo remains adamant that she was always the same murderer she was in Hell. Justin responds by forcing a flashback while Lo watches. In the flashback, Justin and April are in bed but are both woken up when she has nightmare. Justin says that her dreams have been getting worse and that she apologizes repeatedly. April suddenly smells sulfur and is attacked by Jeez. Justin tries to help but is slashed across his chest. As he lies dying, April bargains with Jeez to return to Hell as long as she is allowed to save him first, a condition Jeez agrees to. He reminds her to bring the book, but she brings the book of Faust instead, leaving the demon summoning book with Justin. Once the flashback ends, Lo admonishes Justin for not burning the book, saying that not doing so goes against the love that drove him, and that Justin had betrayed his love. Justin becomes digressive with Lo and comes to the conclusion that humans are allowed to make mistakes, while demons get satisfaction from torturing them because they don't have a choice. Lo begins to laugh again, accompanied with other demons, while Justin holds his head in pain. After Lo stops laughing at him, Justin becomes infuriated and shouts at a surprised Lo, reiterating that he is the master and that he has power over Lo. He insinuates that Lo has been appearing in several forms and planting doubts in his mind to make him leave, an act Justin refuses to do. He orders Lo once again to find April in Hell, and then to ""fuck off"". Lo, left speechless, leaves. Once Justin calms down, he looks at a picture of April and begins to cry. Justin looks up to see April in front of him. She notes that he didn't burn the book, something Justin apologizes for as he wasn't able to, but she forgives him. She asks him if he still wants to save her, despite everything he has been told, to which Justin responds that he knows who she really is. Upon seeing that Justin loves her, she tells him to turn to a page in the book and read the spell. After doing so, April is able to enter the pentagram. She kisses Justin, extracting the poison from his body. April tells Justin that she can't go with him as the demons would always find them, putting Justin in danger. Justin offers to stay but April refuses to let him stay in Hell for eternity. Justin simply says that she is the only thing he has in his life, to which April reminds him that she isn't a woman or a human. She tells him once again to burn the book when he leaves, leaving the circle and undoing the spell that allowed her to enter. As April drags herself away, Justin calls after her. Looking back, she becomes Lo, revealing that they were the same person from the start, and that Lo's intention was to deter Justin because it didn't believe it was worth saving. Lo looks back silently and begins to drag itself away again. Justin watches as Lo leaves, not saying a word. The next day Justin is shown in his apartment preparing to burn the book.

After escaping from the fox, they find Sean's mother telling them it is time to get ready for flying. Sean bids farewell to Puffin for spring. Sean's father arrives late, then the family take off. Meanwhile, Sean spots some doves while flying behind his family and wants to play. He ends up getting lost in a cloud cover and his wing clipped by the wing of a plane. After that, he falls from the sky landing in the water. Sean's mother looks around for him, leaving the father with his two smaller siblings. Sean makes it out of the river he fell in. While wandering around, he meets up with a wise brown rodent named Voley, who has some techniques he tries to assist in getting Sean into the sky to catch up with his family. None of them work, but Voley tells some tales about being an astronaut and having a story in the newspapers about him once. Meanwhile, Sean’s mother is unable to find Sean by the lake. She spots the fox and sees two white feathers and assumes the fox had devoured Sean. She feels at fault and goes off to find her family in the sky. Voley tells Sean that music is grass, showing him how to hold the grass, fill his cheeks and blow. Next the two are dancing to the flute music with a herd of lambs behind them. All of a sudden, the music stops and the lambs leave due to the first snow flake falling down from the sky. This tickles Sean who has never seen snow before and thinks he and Voley will wait for spring together. Voley then walks over to a tree and starts poking fun at the squirrels up above which results in nuts and berries being thrown down from the tree. Voley snatches them up telling Sean this will be his food for the winter. Then he rides on the lambs gathering wool to keep Sean warm for the winter. Shortly the fox comes and gives chase. They stumble on an old ship where they spend the night. Before Voley leaves he tells Sean to look for the lambs since they are the first sign of spring arriving. A windy snowstorm comes and Sean settles in a boot left behind in the snow. The next morning, Sean has a difficult time getting around in the snow with his webbed feet and spots something in the snow. Puffin got lost in the cloud cover also and is frozen stiff. Sean then drags Puffin back to the boat sharing his nuts and berries and teaching Puffin how to play music with the grass. One morning, Sean takes a peek out of the boot to come face to face with a lamb. This is the signal for spring and the two friends search for their families. They run into the fox again only this time Sean bites his nose. Sean and Puffin run onto the ship but are cornered by the fox. Suddenly Voley arrives, but the fox then grabs him and tosses him to another side of the ship. The fox comes after Sean chasing him off the ship where the only place to go is the water. While Sean is sliding down the hill to land in the water, he takes flight and escapes the fox, who tumbles into the water. So happy in outsmarting the fox, Sean flies over to the ship to tell Voley who is still laying in the spot the fox tossed him. Puffin then spots his family in the sky arriving home and calls out to them. Sean’s parents are again last to arrive due to the father forgetting his whistle. The flute music plays while Sean is reunited with his family.

Jessie is from a conservative Malayali Nasrani Christian family from Alappuzha, Kerala, that lives upstairs. Sachin falls in love with Jessie the moment he meets her. Sachin tries to interact with Jessie, who is afraid of speaking to men around her strict father, and ends up angering Jessie. Unable to hide his feelings for her any longer, Sachin confesses his love for her, to which she does not respond. A few days later, Sachin learns from his sister that Jessie has gone to Kerala to visit her grandmother. He, along with Anay, ends up in Kerala to look for her. After several days, he finds her, apologises and she introduces him to her family in Kerala as her ""classmate"". Jessie denies she has any feelings for him, but agrees to be his friend. On the train journey back home, however, the two get closer and share a passionate kiss. Sachin is convinced Jessie loves him; the two meet several times and Jessie begins to admit that she also likes Sachin, but wants to refrain from any problems because she knows her father wouldn't give her hand in marriage to a Hindu.

The wolf, who had been killed by the woodcutter , is revealed to have left behind family and friends who now wish to get revenge on Little Red. The deceased wolf's mother pays his friend, Lean Wolf to take her other son, Fat wolf and together catch Little Red Riding Hood. The wolves find a way to make Little Red Riding Hood believe that her grandmother has fallen ill again. Unaware that her grandmother is not truly ill, Little Red Riding Hood sets out through the forest to go visit her, meeting the wolves and other people on her journey. The little girl manages to foil all of the plans thought of by the wolves to catch her. They try dressing in clothes that will deceive Little Red Riding Hood into believing that they are kind and friendly, but in the end, she sucks them into her own game and they continually fail to catch her. Wolf cub, the deceased wolf's son, who spends his time reading stories, is clearly opposed to taking revenge on anyone for the things that have happened, and prefers to have nothing to do with his vengeful wolf family. His grandmother, angry with his lack of support, burns his storybook, which sends the cub into tears, and he runs away from his grandmother. On her travels, Little Red Riding Hood meets with ever more obstacles , such as a young spoiled boy who wishes to take Little Red Riding Hood as his possession so he can play with her whenever he wishes. He locks her in a room, but she is saved by Lean Wolf and Fat Wolf, who are now dressed as stately women, but are waiting with a sack to snatch her up. Wolf Cub takes the sack and foils their plans. The cub tries to hint at Little Red Riding Hood that her grandmother is not truly ill, but she does not heed his advice and continues on her way, and again the two wolves attempt to catch her. However, Fat Wolf, has grown attached to Little Red Riding Hood and is no longer so keen on capturing her as he had been initially. Little Red later learns from a shepherd who had previously conspired with the wolves, that her newfound companions are indeed the wolves. Upset and frustrated by this news, she dresses as the shepherd and gets the Lean Wolf to confirm his identity. She also brought the wolves a sleeping pill made of poppies instead of water, and they were put to sleep. Little Red Riding Hood proceeds to run away and runs into a hunter who only speaks of himself as if he were great, when in reality he is a coward. He wishes to shoot the wolves while they are asleep, but the girl stops him because she wishes to take the wolves to her village to be judged and so they can repent. The people from the village now learn of the trouble and come to Little Red Riding Hood's aid. They intend to hurt the wolves, but Little Red does not wish them any harm. She allows the wolves to flee.

Chon, a former Navy SEAL, smuggled the seeds for the plants out of Afghanistan. These seeds yielded a particularly potent strain of marijuana that soon developed a wide customer base and made Chon and Ben very wealthy. The two share O  as a girlfriend. While Ben is doing charity work overseas, Chon and O receive a video from cartel enforcer Lado , a man they do not know. The video shows several severed heads and a chainsaw, leading them to worry about Ben, who they fear is one of the victims. However, Ben returns safely the next day, and Chon and Ben go to meet with the Mexican cartel. After refusing the cartel's offer for a partnership, Chon and Ben make plans with O to leave and go to Indonesia for a year, not telling her that they are fleeing the cartel. Chon and Ben speak to corrupt DEA agent Dennis  who urges them to partner with the cartel. O, meanwhile, is kidnapped by Lado and several members of the cartel. Chon and Ben are notified of O's kidnapping via a Skype call from cartel leader Elena , who threatens to harm O before again urging the two to partner with the cartel. Chon and Ben speak with Dennis about the situation, but the conversation turns sour, with Chon stabbing Dennis in the hand and punching him in the face. After Dennis angrily leaves, Chon and Ben decide to retaliate. With help from Chon's Navy SEAL friends, the duo attacks a cartel truck, killing seven of Elena's men. The duo decides to frame Alex  for the murders. With help from Dennis, they falsify the evidence and give it to Lado, who tortures the man before forcing Ben to immolate him. While being tortured, the man begs for his life ""On the head of Magda"", revealing to Chon and Ben that Elena's daughter is still alive. O has been kept in horrible living conditions while asking to speak to someone. Elena, feeling lonely for her, allows her to contact her mother. While in captivity and after being drugged, Lado rapes O and records it. Elena later brings her to her estate to have someone to talk to. Meanwhile, Ben and Chon bribe Dennis for information on Magda , ultimately paying him $3 million for the information and the name of his snitch in Elena's cartel. After kidnapping Magda, Ben and Chon skype Elena once more, establishing that they are now in control. With Elena at their mercy, the two arrange a meeting, at which point both O and Magda will be released. The exchange is set to occur in the middle of the desert, with snipers from both sides prepared to fire. Elena requests to know the identity of the man who revealed the location of her daughter, and Chon reveals that it was Lado. Elena attempts to kill Lado, but he shoots her first. An intense shootout erupts, with Chon being shot several times. Lado is shot in the back by Ben, but manages to shoot Ben in the neck before being killed by O. With Ben mortally wounded, Chon injects him, himself, and O with a fatal overdose, so the three can die together. It is then revealed that this sequence is only how O wishes the events had transpired. In reality, Lado steals Elena's car and drives off as DEA agents arrive, led by Dennis. Everyone at the meeting is arrested, but since Ben possesses incriminating information on Dennis, Dennis names Ben and Chon as his informants for the past six years, leading to them being released from jail. Ben, Chon, and O leave the country and start a new life."

There, they meet Mr. Hubley who works there. Shaggy asks if there is anything to eat, and Hubley says no, but there is a barbecue in town. The gang goes to the barbecue, and all but Shaggy and Scooby-Doo go off to see the paleontological dig of Professor Svankmajor. Shaggy and Scooby are too full to walk right away. When they set out, a gila monster steals a biscuit from them, causing Scooby to go after it. He meets the Phantosaur  and runs away. Later, Shaggy and Scooby are chased by the Phantosaur and narrowly escape. Meanwhile, Professor Svankmajor shows the rest of the gang over the dig, and Velma meets Svankmajor's student, Winsor. She instantly sees him as a soul mate and they plan to go out on a date, to which Fred replies to Daphne,""On our own for clue searching then."" Back at the spa, Shaggy is in terrible shape after a fright. Mr. Hubley helps with aromatherapy, assisted by Scooby-Doo adding a Scooby Snack to the aromas. Shaggy becomes more calm, but freaks out again when Mr. Hubley tells them the legend of the Phantosaur. The legend says the Phantosaur was summoned by Native Americans to drive out Spanish conquistadors, but it turned on them instead. Hubley has an advanced hypnosis machine with a hologram projector. He hypnotizes Shaggy to become fearless and unstoppable when he heard the word ""bad,"" and to switch back to normal when he hears it again. Then he orders Shaggy to forget everything; unfortunately, Hubley himself is affected by the hypnosis and he can't remember the key word for Shaggy. Daphne, Fred, and Velma go back to the dig to look for clues, but Velma is so lovestruck that she's not much use. She misses an obvious clue about many footprints going to a part of the cave where Winsor says they never go. Meanwhile, Scooby and Shaggy go to an all-you-can-eat restaurant and start to eat it out of business. Then a biker gang comes in. Shaggy accidentally squirts the contents of a hot dog bun on one of the bikers, who grabs him and says something about how he's going to get hurt ""bad."" Suddenly Shaggy is fearless. He knocks all of them out. Then the gang leader, Tex, arrives and challenges him to a motorcycle race on Dead Man's curve. Shaggy confidently accepts, even though he's never ridden a motorcycle before. As Tex leaves, he says he won't kill Shaggy ""bad."" Then, Vincent told Tex that if he does, he will get got . Suddenly back to normal, Shaggy is terrified of the challenge he just accepted. Meanwhile, Randy warns the girls to pass it on. That night, Daphne decides to give him motorcycling lessons, because she drove a motorcycle when she was five. Shaggy and Tex have a motorcycle race, and Shaggy hears ""bad"" just in time and almost wins, until a Phantosaur shows up and he thinks in his mind that the monster must think it's so ""bad,"" which is enough to make him cowardly again and get chased. Eventually, they figure out that there were two phantosaurs and they were robots. The culprits were two mining engineers who wanted the silver they found in the area, which they couldn't get to because of the paleontologists. Once back at Hubley's they find the hologram projector gone and they get attacked by a pack of Velociraptor and a ghostly fire-breathing Tyrannosaurus. They learn that it was Professor Svankmajor and Winsor, much to Velma's dismay. They had found a complete Allosaurus encased in quartz crystal, a beautiful and priceless find, and they wanted to keep it for themselves. They wanted to scare everyone off so they could dig it out and take it away. They disguised three other graduate students in velociraptor costumes, and created an original red Phantosaur with an advanced holgraphic projector  and paint-stripper devices that blasted super-heated air for the fire effects. While they are underground, the dynamite charges Svankmajor set to blast free the dinosaur crystal go off . Shaggy's hypnotic bravery comes in again, until Daphne praises him that he's ""not bad."" Scooby realizes the keyword but is unable to tell the rest of the gang . Shaggy has to complete the rest of the escape on sheer guts, and with some help from his new biker friends. Svankmajor and Winsor are arrested, but Velma says she will date Winsor again when he gets out of jail. They then go back to La Serena Spa and Mr. Hubley tries to un-hypnotize Shaggy, accidentally making the entire gang into Shaggy. The end of the movie shows them driving away in the ""Mustard"" Machine."

However, Ónódi can't organize the team only from his company, because only 8 out of 98 soldiers can play football. Therefore Ónódi recruits players from the other company. One of the players is Steiner, who is a Jew and can't play football. He lied to Ónódi because he was afraid to die. During training the footballers subdue the German corporal guarding them and try to escape. They are soon recaptured and told they will now face probable death penalty. However, the Germans order the Hungarian team to still play the match. At the beginning of the match Ónódi and his team are discouraged, as the Germans easily score three goals. The Hungarians succeed in scoring one goal and the first half ends 3-1 in favour of Germany. At the interval the German commander tells the Hungarians that they might not be executed if they lose the match. The Hungarians refuse to believe this.

They are welcomed by the peasants, who hope that the new doctrines will help to liberate them from the operssing yoke of the nobility and the magistrates. The young pastor Thomas Muentzer embraces Lutheranism, but he is more radical in his support for the peasants. At 1523, Muentzer arrives in Allstedt to assume the office of the local pastor. When a local villager is arrested after assaulting an overseer who tried to rape his sister, the priest assists him to escape. He also carries a first Mass in German rather than Latin, and preaches his flock to destroy all the saints' icons in the local chappel, which he deems to be heretical. The people burn it down. The local baron retaliates by destroying the village. The priest now realizes that he is no longer a follower of Luther, who called to refrain from violence. He flees to southern Germany, where he and his friend Heinrich Pfeiffer take over the city of Muehlhausen and form a peasant rebel army, intending to liberate the people. But betrayal and the schemes of the nobility bring about their defeat in the Battle of Frankenhausen. Muentzer is captured; as he is tortured, he refuses to deny his religious doctrines and is then executed.

Mavis receives an e-mail with a picture of the newborn daughter of her high school boyfriend Buddy Slade ([[Patrick Wilson  and his wife Beth . Believing this to be a sign she and Buddy are meant to be together, Mavis leaves Minneapolis returns to her hometown of Mercury, Minnesota, to reclaim her life with Buddy, under the pretext of overseeing a real estate deal. Upon arriving after multiple listens of ""The Concept"" by Teenage Fanclub on an old mixtape Buddy gave her in high school, Mavis arranges to meet him the next day at a local sports bar, for old time's sake. In the interim, she goes alone to a different bar, Woody's. There she reconnects with a former classmate she barely remembers, Matt Freehauf , who became partially disabled after being beaten by jocks who erroneously assumed he was gay. Matt tells Mavis that her plan to destroy Buddy's marriage is irrational and selfish, but she ignores him. The following day, Mavis meets Buddy at the sports bar, where they run into Matt, the bar's bookkeeper. On their way out, Buddy invites Mavis to a performance of Beth's ""mom rock band."" In the interim, Mavis spends another night getting drunk with Matt, who distills homemade bourbon in the garage of the house he shares with his sister Sandra. When Mavis attends the concert of Beth's band, the other moms are resentful of Mavis, who they remember as the ""psychotic prom queen bitch."" When Beth's band performs, the lead singer dedicates their opening song to Buddy from Beth; much to Mavis's dismay, it is ""The Concept"". Beth wants to stay out longer, so Mavis offers to drive the drunk Buddy home. On the lawn they share a kiss that is quickly broken up when the babysitter opens the front door to greet them. The next day, after an awkward encounter with her parents, Mavis is invited to Buddy's daughter's naming ceremony. She later goes out drinking with Matt again, during which Matt tells Mavis to grow up. The following day, Mavis attends the party, where she declares her love for Buddy, but he rebuffs her. Everyone at the party is called out to the lawn to await a surprise Buddy has prepared for Beth. Mavis, who has been drinking at the party, collides with Beth, who accidentally spills wine on Mavis' dress. Mavis insults her, and in a profanity-laced tirade tearfully reveals she became pregnant with Buddy's baby years ago, but had a miscarriage after three months. Buddy, who has been preparing a drum-set gift for Beth in the garage, opens the garage door and belatedly learns what has transpired. Mavis asks him why he invited her. He reveals it was Beth's idea, as she feels sorry for Mavis. Humiliated, Mavis leaves the party and visits Matt, where she breaks down in tears and initiates sex. On the following morning, while Matt sleeps, Mavis has coffee in the kitchen with Sandra, who still idolizes her. Mavis talks about needing to change herself, but Sandra says Mavis is better than the rest of Mercury and should not change. Mavis decides to return to Minneapolis. Sandra asks to go with her, but Mavis says, ""You're good here, Sandra."" She leaves alone. In a diner on her way home, Mavis writes the last chapter of the book, in which the main character graduates high school and looks forward to becoming an adult. Afterward, in the parking lot, Mavis contemplates her crumpled car."

Cooper poses a difficult question regarding former vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin: was she selected because she would make the best vice president or because she would win the election? The film flashes back to Senator John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign, which Schmidt serves as Senior Campaign Strategist. McCain's preferred running mate, Senator Joe Lieberman, is rejected by the majority of hos senior advisers – including Schmidt – because he will not excite the Republican base nor help compete with the celebrity of their opponent, Democratic Senator Barack Obama. The strategists quickly look for a ""game change"": a replacement who would tilt public excitement in their favor and attract both women and conservative voters. Investigating prominent female Republican politicians, the campaign finds Palin, the governor of Alaska, to have the charismatic qualities they want. After an exceptionally brief vetting process, she is selected. Palin's eventual public reveal creates the buzz that Schmidt and McCain were looking for, bringing them to even or better with Obama in the polls. While Palin's acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention is well received, the campaign becomes concerned that she is ignorant about many political issues and grossly unprepared. Schmidt handles controversies from her past, such as Troopergate, while other staff attempt to fill broad gaps in her understanding of domestic and foreign politics. At times she is preoccupied with her approval ratings in Alaska and the absence of her family while campaigning, eventually becoming unresponsive to advisers who begin to question her mental state. Several prominent blunders in major interviews, such as those with Katie Couric, are a source of mockery in the media and frustration in the campaign. Schmidt opines that YouTube has altered the media landscape in that Palin's gaffes are seen online repeatedly rather than being forgotten in the news cycle. In the latter months of 2008, prospects for the McCain campaign look poor. The campaign staff boosts a negative campaign against Obama's past associations with the liberal elite, which Palin supports but McCain resists. The staff also comes to accept that Palin is better at memorizing and delivering lines than she is at understanding issues. However, Palin's growing popularity soon overshadows the campaign; Palin becomes uncooperative, rejecting Schmidt and the rest of the campaign staff as she gains her own following. McCain, meanwhile, becomes discouraged by the negative campaigning, watching growing hostility and vitriol emerge toward Obama among McCain's supporters. With Election Day approaching, senior campaigners express regret that Palin turned out to be style without substance, with Schmidt bemoaning that they neglected to vet her competency. McCain consoles Schmidt by reaffirming that taking a risk with Palin was better than fading away. When Obama wins the election on Election Night, McCain and his advisers stop a rebellious Palin from giving a concession speech along with McCain's, claiming it was unheard of for a vice-presidential candidate. The film returns to the 2010 interview as Schmidt answers Cooper's question about whether he would pick Palin again if he had the chance to do it over. Schmidt replies that life does not give you do-overs."

Schmidt handles controversies from her past, such as Troopergate, while other staff attempt to fill broad gaps in her understanding of domestic and foreign politics. At times she is preoccupied with her approval ratings in Alaska and the absence of her family while campaigning, eventually becoming unresponsive to advisers who begin to question her mental state. Several prominent blunders in major interviews, such as those with Katie Couric, are a source of mockery in the media and frustration in the campaign. Schmidt opines that YouTube has altered the media landscape in that Palin's gaffes are seen online repeatedly rather than being forgotten in the news cycle. In the latter months of 2008, prospects for the McCain campaign look poor. The campaign staff boosts a negative campaign against Obama's past associations with the liberal elite, which Palin supports but McCain resists. The staff also comes to accept that Palin is better at memorizing and delivering lines than she is at understanding issues. However, Palin's growing popularity soon overshadows the campaign; Palin becomes uncooperative, rejecting Schmidt and the rest of the campaign staff as she gains her own following. McCain, meanwhile, becomes discouraged by the negative campaigning, watching growing hostility and vitriol emerge toward Obama among McCain's supporters. With Election Day approaching, senior campaigners express regret that Palin turned out to be style without substance, with Schmidt bemoaning that they neglected to vet her competency. McCain consoles Schmidt by reaffirming that taking a risk with Palin was better than fading away. When Obama wins the election on Election Night, McCain and his advisers stop a rebellious Palin from giving a concession speech along with McCain's, claiming it was unheard of for a vice-presidential candidate. The film returns to the 2010 interview as Schmidt answers Cooper's question about whether he would pick Palin again if he had the chance to do it over. Schmidt replies that life does not give you do-overs."

After the leading man's penchant for teenage girls gets them banished from their New Hampshire location, a film crew relocates to the small town of Waterford, Vermont, to finish shooting ""The Old Mill.""

Unfazed, the film's director, Walt Price , places his faith in the ability of first-time screenwriter Joseph Turner White  to alter the script; what he doesn't count on is White's apparently bottomless reserve of angst-fueled writer's block.

89272 The action of the film starts with Colonel Dodge  arriving on the first train and subsequently opening the new railroad line that links Dodge City with the rest of the world. A few years later, Dodge City has turned into the ""longhorn cattle center of the world and wide-open Babylon of the American frontier, packed with settlers, thieves and gunmen &mdash; the town that knew no ethics but cash and killing"". In particular, it is Jeff Surrett  and his gang who kill, steal, cheat and, generally, control life in Dodge City without ever being brought to justice. As Surrett has installed one of his puppets as sheriff, the other citizens' hands are tied when it comes to arresting any of the evildoers. Dodge's friend Wade Hatton , a lone cowboy who was instrumental in bringing the railroad to Dodge City, is now on his way to the town leading a trek of settlers from the East coast. At Hatton's side is his old companion Rusty , who is prepared to stay with him through thick and thin. Among the settlers are beautiful Abbie Irving  and her irresponsible brother Lee , who, drunk, causes a stampede  and is shot by Hatton in self-defense. When the group arrive in Dodge City, Hatton is confronted with the full extent of the anarchy which is dictating everyday life there. Asked by anxious citizens — Abbie's uncle, Dr. Irving  among them — to be the new sheriff, Hatton politely declines, saying he is not cut out for this kind of job. Hatton changes his mind when, during a school outing, a young boy, Harry Cole is inadvertently killed by Surrett and his men. The new sheriff and his deputy — Rusty of course — have a hard time not just fighting the criminals but also convincing all the farmers who have been wronged by Surrett that mob rule  is out of the question: When Yancey , one of Surrett's thugs, is in jail, Hatton has to protect him against the furious men outside who, not caring for Yancey's right to a fair trial, want to take the law into their own hands and lynch him right then and there. In the end, Hatton succeeds in both overwhelming and catching the baddies and winning Abbie's heart. Everything has been prepared for a quiet family life in newly civilized Dodge City, but Hatton is asked by Colonel Dodge to clean up Virginia City, Nevada, another railroad town more dangerous than Dodge City had ever been. Understanding how much Wade is needed to settle the West, a loving Abbie heartily suggests she and her new husband join the next wagon train for their new life together.

The film moves to the offices of former chief justice turned private prosecutor Dhingra  where he interviews the three leading members of the Mumbai Encounter Squad: Assistant Commissioner of Police Shamsher S. Khan  , Inspector Kaviraj Patil  and Inspector Javed Sheikh ([[Arbaaz Khan . The main film timeline is the extended interview of the three officers by Dhingra; as the officers answer Dhingra's questions, the film flashes back to show the incidents. Dhingra asks about the Encounter Squad. Khan explains that he hand-picked 27 of Mumbai police's best enlisted men and officers. He borrowed the concept from the LAPD SWAT Special Weapons And Tactics team to help combat crime. The film flashes back to show Khan selecting his men and putting them through intensive physical and mental training to be ""fast, efficient and deadly."" Dhingra is hardly impressed: He points out that if Khan ""shoots to kill"" he is no different from the gangsters he seeks to destroy. Dhingra asks why Khan felt he had do this. Khan explains that following Operation Bluestar in 1984, several Sikh terrorists fled to Mumbai and began establishing a base in the city. They engaged in violence, extortion and other subversive tactics to grow their operations. The film flashes back to show Sub Inspector Mhatre, a very brave officer and disciple of Khan, pursuing and subsequently getting shot down by a group of Sikh terrorists. Khan is deeply frustrated when the Mumbai police, mired in internal bureaucracy and corruption, fail to act. He obtains clearance from the police commissioner Krishnamurthy  and sets out after the militants. Khan asks Meeta Matu  to cover the incident so as to deter future terrorists. True to Khan's words, he successfully ""encounters""  the terrorists who shot PSI Mhatre. As per Aftab Ahmed Khan the encounter with Khalistani Extremist was more dangerous and tough than Shootout at Lokhandwala. The film segues into the life of Maya . Maya is the second-in-command of the ""big boss"" in Dubai  and runs Dawood's criminal activities in Mumbai. Maya recruits Bhua  after successfully hatching a plot to eliminate Bhua's old gang led by Ashok Joshi. At this point, Maya and Bhua are at the top of Mumbai's underworld, reporting directly to the big boss in Dubai. Things heat up when Khan recognizes, through his network of spies and informers, that Maya is responsible for several criminal and possibly terrorist activities. Around this time, Maya's ambitions, fueled by his Aai's  insistence, grow to the point where he wishes to assert his independence from Dubai and take over Mumbai himself. Khan's ATS now focuses on eliminating Maya and Bhua, and begins a dangerous cat-and-mouse game where neither side shows any overt aggression but tries to disable the adversary by tactical maneuver. Khan launches ""visits"" to the criminals' families to try to ""persuade"" them to counsel the criminals to surrender. In turn, Maya and his men return the ""visit"" by approaching the cops at social situations. Maya visits Khan at a restaurant where Khan is having dinner with his family. Maya quietly tells Khan: ""This is between your men and mine. Leave the families out of it."" Khan retorts: ""I did this to give you an opportunity to come clean. But now it appears that any resolution hangs off the barrel of a gun."" Maya's rage intensifies when he gets thrown out by prominent city builder Wadhwani . Maya had demanded 40 lakhs protection money; Wadhwani claimed to deal directly with Dubai. Maya kidnaps Wadhwani's sniveling, overweight kid. When Wadhwani complains, the big boss asks Maya to cut it out and return the child immediately. Maya quietly informs the boss that he has upped his demands and that he wants to reign supreme in Mumbai. The film also explores the personal lives of the protagonists. Khan's wife Rohini  is unable to bear his constant neglect of his family life. She files for divorce. Patil's divorce is nearly upon him, too. In the enemy camp, Buwa has shacked up with a bar dancer Tanu  and is unable to spend any quality time with her. Fellow criminals Phatu  and RC  have similar troubles. It all comes to a head in November 1991. The five criminals including Maya and Buwa secure themselves, while holding Wadhwani's kid, in a flat at Swati building in Lokhandwala. Khan is tipped off of the location by an informant.  Khan assembles a large squad of cops and lays siege to the location. He announces over the bullhorn that residents are advised to stay indoors and bolt their windows. A long and devastating gun battle begins. The criminals launch rocket propelled grenades from their flat and try to escape. But they are overwhelmed by police fire, and all five criminals are eventually slain. The battle lays waste to the building: Film shots show the staircases, hallways and several civilian flats completely pulverized by gunfire. Reporter Meeta Matu covers the action live. Up to this point, Dhingra has been negative and denigrating of Khan and his efforts with the ATS. He cites press reports and civilian complaints that condemn Khan  of unilateral and unwarranted excessive force in a residential locality. Charges are brought against Khan and the ATS. But when Dhingra rises to defend them as their appointed counsel, he, in a surprising twist, presents an unconventional argument as defense. The film ends with Khan and the ATS being acquitted.

Vincent felt it was childish of Jennifer childish to travel to New York City to send him a box of dolls from Hong Kong. Infuriated, Jennifer walks back to the car and throws the box of dolls on the street. Later that night, Pang answers a call made by Vincent because Jennifer would not answer. He told Jennifer to meet with him for lunch at Silver Palace restaurant the next day. Coincidentally, Pang works as a busboy at the restaurant and overhears their conversations. After saving enough money, Jennifer meant to study in New York as a means to be with Vincent. Vincent tells Jennifer to explore the city and meet new people than to follow him everywhere.

Not knowing Jennifer was busy, he did not have a chance to tell her he had tickets for the show, he tried to sell the tickets, claiming they were for Bull, when she asked. Jennifer climbed off the bus to help Pang with the guard, but would be late for her babysitting job, so Pang insisted driving her there. He stripped the car and rebuilt it, so she would not have to hold onto the broken door. Concerned, Pang runs to her and asks why she will not go in. She is anxious and asks Pang to accompany her.

She asks Pang if she looks better than Peggy. Pang did not care how others looked, or how others looked at him, as long as he kept his dignity. He told Jennifer that it was his dream to open a restaurant on a pier on the beach, and name it Samuel Pang. Next morning, Samuel Pang wrote on his mirror—three commandments and five goals; one goal being ""If you want it, go for it"", in this case Pang going for ""cha bo"", Jennifer. Pang is holding a party, and invites Jennifer, but does not tell her it his birthday. Vincent heard she was at a party, so he talked with Jennifer the entire night. The conversation became awkward when he mentioned he broke up with Peggy. Pang, serving guests leaves because he does not think he will have a chance with Jennifer. He went drinking and gambling until Bull asks for more money to pay off the gangs. Frustrated, Pang gathered a group of friends drove in search for the gang and beat them up. Jennifer wanders in Pang's room sees a mirror written with words by him. He wrote his name, age, and birthday in English. Feeling lonely, she walks across a park and sees Anna at her school. Mrs. Sherwood sees her and invites her to move with Anna in Long Island. Pang comes back to his apartment the next morning and finds his room with a Jennifer's graduation certificate. To congratulate her, he buys the watchband as a gift. The old man did not accept his offer, so Pang sold his car for the watchband. Excited to see Jennifer with the gift, he runs to her apartment only to see Vincent helping Jennifer move furniture in his car. She gives him her number. They exchange gifts, but Pang runs after her after she leaves. Unable to catch up, he walks to a beach. He opens his gift and finds her grandfather's watch.

89272 The action of the film starts with Colonel Dodge  arriving on the first train and subsequently opening the new railroad line that links Dodge City with the rest of the world. A few years later, Dodge City has turned into the ""longhorn cattle center of the world and wide-open Babylon of the American frontier, packed with settlers, thieves and gunmen &mdash; the town that knew no ethics but cash and killing"". In particular, it is Jeff Surrett  and his gang who kill, steal, cheat and, generally, control life in Dodge City without ever being brought to justice. As Surrett has installed one of his puppets as sheriff, the other citizens' hands are tied when it comes to arresting any of the evildoers. Dodge's friend Wade Hatton , a lone cowboy who was instrumental in bringing the railroad to Dodge City, is now on his way to the town leading a trek of settlers from the East coast. At Hatton's side is his old companion Rusty , who is prepared to stay with him through thick and thin. Among the settlers are beautiful Abbie Irving  and her irresponsible brother Lee , who, drunk, causes a stampede  and is shot by Hatton in self-defense. When the group arrive in Dodge City, Hatton is confronted with the full extent of the anarchy which is dictating everyday life there. Asked by anxious citizens — Abbie's uncle, Dr. Irving  among them — to be the new sheriff, Hatton politely declines, saying he is not cut out for this kind of job. Hatton changes his mind when, during a school outing, a young boy, Harry Cole is inadvertently killed by Surrett and his men. The new sheriff and his deputy — Rusty of course — have a hard time not just fighting the criminals but also convincing all the farmers who have been wronged by Surrett that mob rule  is out of the question: When Yancey , one of Surrett's thugs, is in jail, Hatton has to protect him against the furious men outside who, not caring for Yancey's right to a fair trial, want to take the law into their own hands and lynch him right then and there. In the end, Hatton succeeds in both overwhelming and catching the baddies and winning Abbie's heart. Everything has been prepared for a quiet family life in newly civilized Dodge City, but Hatton is asked by Colonel Dodge to clean up Virginia City, Nevada, another railroad town more dangerous than Dodge City had ever been. Understanding how much Wade is needed to settle the West, a loving Abbie heartily suggests she and her new husband join the next wagon train for their new life together.

Out of gratitude, Dinah offers to write a speech for Tom on equality, which he is scheduled to deliver the next night at the Forum Society's Spring Dance. While preparing the speech, which is a modified version of one of her own debates, Dinah learns that her exit from jail was witnessed by two women, who then relayed the information to Dan Fletcher, Andrew's Scottish vestryman.

Khan  , Inspector Kaviraj Patil  and Inspector Javed Sheikh ([[Arbaaz Khan . The main film timeline is the extended interview of the three officers by Dhingra; as the officers answer Dhingra's questions, the film flashes back to show the incidents. Dhingra asks about the Encounter Squad. Khan explains that he hand-picked 27 of Mumbai police's best enlisted men and officers. He borrowed the concept from the LAPD SWAT Special Weapons And Tactics team to help combat crime. The film flashes back to show Khan selecting his men and putting them through intensive physical and mental training to be ""fast, efficient and deadly."" Dhingra is hardly impressed: He points out that if Khan ""shoots to kill"" he is no different from the gangsters he seeks to destroy. Dhingra asks why Khan felt he had do this. Khan explains that following Operation Bluestar in 1984, several Sikh terrorists fled to Mumbai and began establishing a base in the city. They engaged in violence, extortion and other subversive tactics to grow their operations. The film flashes back to show Sub Inspector Mhatre, a very brave officer and disciple of Khan, pursuing and subsequently getting shot down by a group of Sikh terrorists. Khan is deeply frustrated when the Mumbai police, mired in internal bureaucracy and corruption, fail to act. He obtains clearance from the police commissioner Krishnamurthy  and sets out after the militants. Khan asks Meeta Matu  to cover the incident so as to deter future terrorists.

At this point, Maya and Bhua are at the top of Mumbai's underworld, reporting directly to the big boss in Dubai. Things heat up when Khan recognizes, through his network of spies and informers, that Maya is responsible for several criminal and possibly terrorist activities. Around this time, Maya's ambitions, fueled by his Aai's  insistence, grow to the point where he wishes to assert his independence from Dubai and take over Mumbai himself. Khan's ATS now focuses on eliminating Maya and Bhua, and begins a dangerous cat-and-mouse game where neither side shows any overt aggression but tries to disable the adversary by tactical maneuver. Khan launches ""visits"" to the criminals' families to try to ""persuade"" them to counsel the criminals to surrender. In turn, Maya and his men return the ""visit"" by approaching the cops at social situations. Maya visits Khan at a restaurant where Khan is having dinner with his family. Maya quietly tells Khan: ""This is between your men and mine. Leave the families out of it."" Khan retorts: ""I did this to give you an opportunity to come clean. But now it appears that any resolution hangs off the barrel of a gun."" Maya's rage intensifies when he gets thrown out by prominent city builder Wadhwani . Maya had demanded 40 lakhs protection money; Wadhwani claimed to deal directly with Dubai. Maya kidnaps Wadhwani's sniveling, overweight kid. When Wadhwani complains, the big boss asks Maya to cut it out and return the child immediately. Maya quietly informs the boss that he has upped his demands and that he wants to reign supreme in Mumbai. The film also explores the personal lives of the protagonists. Khan's wife Rohini  is unable to bear his constant neglect of his family life. She files for divorce. Patil's divorce is nearly upon him, too. In the enemy camp, Buwa has shacked up with a bar dancer Tanu  and is unable to spend any quality time with her. Fellow criminals Phatu  and RC  have similar troubles. It all comes to a head in November 1991. The five criminals including Maya and Buwa secure themselves, while holding Wadhwani's kid, in a flat at Swati building in Lokhandwala. Khan is tipped off of the location by an informant.  Khan assembles a large squad of cops and lays siege to the location. He announces over the bullhorn that residents are advised to stay indoors and bolt their windows. A long and devastating gun battle begins. The criminals launch rocket propelled grenades from their flat and try to escape. But they are overwhelmed by police fire, and all five criminals are eventually slain. The battle lays waste to the building: Film shots show the staircases, hallways and several civilian flats completely pulverized by gunfire. Reporter Meeta Matu covers the action live. Up to this point, Dhingra has been negative and denigrating of Khan and his efforts with the ATS. He cites press reports and civilian complaints that condemn Khan  of unilateral and unwarranted excessive force in a residential locality. Charges are brought against Khan and the ATS. But when Dhingra rises to defend them as their appointed counsel, he, in a surprising twist, presents an unconventional argument as defense. The film ends with Khan and the ATS being acquitted.

In particular, it is Jeff Surrett  and his gang who kill, steal, cheat and, generally, control life in Dodge City without ever being brought to justice. As Surrett has installed one of his puppets as sheriff, the other citizens' hands are tied when it comes to arresting any of the evildoers. Dodge's friend Wade Hatton , a lone cowboy who was instrumental in bringing the railroad to Dodge City, is now on his way to the town leading a trek of settlers from the East coast. At Hatton's side is his old companion Rusty , who is prepared to stay with him through thick and thin. Among the settlers are beautiful Abbie Irving  and her irresponsible brother Lee , who, drunk, causes a stampede  and is shot by Hatton in self-defense. When the group arrive in Dodge City, Hatton is confronted with the full extent of the anarchy which is dictating everyday life there. Asked by anxious citizens — Abbie's uncle, Dr. Irving  among them — to be the new sheriff, Hatton politely declines, saying he is not cut out for this kind of job. Hatton changes his mind when, during a school outing, a young boy, Harry Cole is inadvertently killed by Surrett and his men. The new sheriff and his deputy — Rusty of course — have a hard time not just fighting the criminals but also convincing all the farmers who have been wronged by Surrett that mob rule  is out of the question: When Yancey , one of Surrett's thugs, is in jail, Hatton has to protect him against the furious men outside who, not caring for Yancey's right to a fair trial, want to take the law into their own hands and lynch him right then and there. In the end, Hatton succeeds in both overwhelming and catching the baddies and winning Abbie's heart. Everything has been prepared for a quiet family life in newly civilized Dodge City, but Hatton is asked by Colonel Dodge to clean up Virginia City, Nevada, another railroad town more dangerous than Dodge City had ever been. Understanding how much Wade is needed to settle the West, a loving Abbie heartily suggests she and her new husband join the next wagon train for their new life together.

The film moves to the offices of former chief justice turned private prosecutor Dhingra  where he interviews the three leading members of the Mumbai Encounter Squad: Assistant Commissioner of Police Shamsher S. Khan  , Inspector Kaviraj Patil  and Inspector Javed Sheikh ([[Arbaaz Khan . The main film timeline is the extended interview of the three officers by Dhingra; as the officers answer Dhingra's questions, the film flashes back to show the incidents. Dhingra asks about the Encounter Squad. Khan explains that he hand-picked 27 of Mumbai police's best enlisted men and officers. He borrowed the concept from the LAPD SWAT Special Weapons And Tactics team to help combat crime. The film flashes back to show Khan selecting his men and putting them through intensive physical and mental training to be ""fast, efficient and deadly."" Dhingra is hardly impressed: He points out that if Khan ""shoots to kill"" he is no different from the gangsters he seeks to destroy. Dhingra asks why Khan felt he had do this. Khan explains that following Operation Bluestar in 1984, several Sikh terrorists fled to Mumbai and began establishing a base in the city. They engaged in violence, extortion and other subversive tactics to grow their operations. The film flashes back to show Sub Inspector Mhatre, a very brave officer and disciple of Khan, pursuing and subsequently getting shot down by a group of Sikh terrorists. Khan is deeply frustrated when the Mumbai police, mired in internal bureaucracy and corruption, fail to act. He obtains clearance from the police commissioner Krishnamurthy  and sets out after the militants. Khan asks Meeta Matu  to cover the incident so as to deter future terrorists. True to Khan's words, he successfully ""encounters""  the terrorists who shot PSI Mhatre. As per Aftab Ahmed Khan the encounter with Khalistani Extremist was more dangerous and tough than Shootout at Lokhandwala. The film segues into the life of Maya . Maya is the second-in-command of the ""big boss"" in Dubai  and runs Dawood's criminal activities in Mumbai. Maya recruits Bhua  after successfully hatching a plot to eliminate Bhua's old gang led by Ashok Joshi. At this point, Maya and Bhua are at the top of Mumbai's underworld, reporting directly to the big boss in Dubai. Things heat up when Khan recognizes, through his network of spies and informers, that Maya is responsible for several criminal and possibly terrorist activities. Around this time, Maya's ambitions, fueled by his Aai's  insistence, grow to the point where he wishes to assert his independence from Dubai and take over Mumbai himself. Khan's ATS now focuses on eliminating Maya and Bhua, and begins a dangerous cat-and-mouse game where neither side shows any overt aggression but tries to disable the adversary by tactical maneuver. Khan launches ""visits"" to the criminals' families to try to ""persuade"" them to counsel the criminals to surrender. In turn, Maya and his men return the ""visit"" by approaching the cops at social situations. Maya visits Khan at a restaurant where Khan is having dinner with his family. Maya quietly tells Khan: ""This is between your men and mine. Leave the families out of it."" Khan retorts: ""I did this to give you an opportunity to come clean. But now it appears that any resolution hangs off the barrel of a gun."" Maya's rage intensifies when he gets thrown out by prominent city builder Wadhwani . Maya had demanded 40 lakhs protection money; Wadhwani claimed to deal directly with Dubai. Maya kidnaps Wadhwani's sniveling, overweight kid. When Wadhwani complains, the big boss asks Maya to cut it out and return the child immediately. Maya quietly informs the boss that he has upped his demands and that he wants to reign supreme in Mumbai. The film also explores the personal lives of the protagonists. Khan's wife Rohini  is unable to bear his constant neglect of his family life. She files for divorce. Patil's divorce is nearly upon him, too. In the enemy camp, Buwa has shacked up with a bar dancer Tanu  and is unable to spend any quality time with her. Fellow criminals Phatu  and RC  have similar troubles. It all comes to a head in November 1991. The five criminals including Maya and Buwa secure themselves, while holding Wadhwani's kid, in a flat at Swati building in Lokhandwala. Khan is tipped off of the location by an informant.  Khan assembles a large squad of cops and lays siege to the location. He announces over the bullhorn that residents are advised to stay indoors and bolt their windows. A long and devastating gun battle begins. The criminals launch rocket propelled grenades from their flat and try to escape. But they are overwhelmed by police fire, and all five criminals are eventually slain. The battle lays waste to the building: Film shots show the staircases, hallways and several civilian flats completely pulverized by gunfire. Reporter Meeta Matu covers the action live. Up to this point, Dhingra has been negative and denigrating of Khan and his efforts with the ATS. He cites press reports and civilian complaints that condemn Khan  of unilateral and unwarranted excessive force in a residential locality. Charges are brought against Khan and the ATS. But when Dhingra rises to defend them as their appointed counsel, he, in a surprising twist, presents an unconventional argument as defense. The film ends with Khan and the ATS being acquitted.

1047834The film is set in the early 20th century in Shanghai International Settlement. The martial arts student Chen Zhen returns to Jingwu School to marry his fiancée Yuan Le-erh. However tragic news awaits him; his master Huo Yuanjia had died, apparently from illness. Chen is deeply saddened and traumatised by the sudden demise of his teacher. Not long after the funeral; two Japanese students from the Bushido School and man working for Hiroshi Susuki in Hongkou, show up. They present a sign to Jingwu School, bearing the words ""Sick Men of East Asia"" , seemingly as to insult Huo Yuanjia, describing the Chinese as ""weaklings"" in comparison to the Japanese. They taunt the Jingwu students to fight them and promise that they will ""eat their words"" if the Jingwu students dare to fight and defeat them. Shortly after, Chen Zhen goes to the Hongkou Dojo alone to return the ""gift"" . He's met with hostility from the Japanese students and they engage in a fight. Chen Zhen defeats all of them, including their Sensei, single-handedly and effortlessly. He uses his master's style of fighting Mizongyi and a Nunchaku as a weapon during the fight. He smashes the glass on the sign and makes the students who taunted him earlier chew up the paper bearing the derogatory words, so as to make them literally ""eat their words"". Chen takes a stroll to a park after that. He is refused entry into the park by a Sikh guard who points towards a sign reading ""No dogs and Chinese allowed"" . After the guard allows a foreigner to bring her pet dog into the park, a Japanese man approaches Chen and tells him that if he behaves like a pet dog, he will be allowed to go in. Chen beats up the man in anger and proceeds to smash the sign with a flying kick. Meanwhile, the Japanese students retaliate by attacking Jingwu School on the orders of their master Hiroshi Suzuki. The Jingwu students are caught by surprise and are totally unprepared for the onslaught. After causing severe damage, the Japanese students leave. They warn Jingwu School to hand over Chen Zhen or else Jingwu will be closed and all the students put under arrest. Chen returns and realises that he has caused big trouble. His fellow students are reluctant to hand him over to the Japanese so they make plans to help him escape from Shanghai. That night, Chen secretly overhears a conversation between the cook and the caretaker and discovers that his master was killed after consuming biscuits laced with poison. He bursts in and confronts them. Chen kills them in blind rage after they claimed responsibility for Huo Yuanjia's death. Chen hangs their bodies from a lamp post after that. The next day, the Jingwu students discover the bodies and suspect that Chen is responsible. However, Chen is nowhere to be found. Eventually, Chen's fiancée finds him hiding near Huo Yuanjia's grave. They share a passionate moment together briefly. At the same time, Suzuki forces the local police inspector to arrest Chen Zhen and bring Chen back to him. The reluctant inspector has no choice but to repeat the Japanese's earlier warnings to Jingwu School. That night, Chen confronts Suzuki's translator and forces a confession out of him, learning the entire truth behind his master's death. But when the cowardly translator sneaks up from behind him, Chen kills the translator and hangs his body from the lamp post. The angry Suzuki decides to take matters into his own hands. He sends his men to attack Jingwu School and kill everyone inside. On the same night, Chen barges into the Dojo to take his revenge. He takes down every single Japanese combatant he meets. Afterwards Chen battles Petrov, a Russian gang boss in league with Suzuki and his plans, who was visiting the Dojo at the time of Chen's attack. Previously Chen, in disguise, had seen Petrov exhibit great feats of strength and fighting ability. The two fighters at first starts out evenly matched and Petrov almost wins, but when Petrov is eventually unable to keep up with the speed of Chen's attacks he gets tired and wounded, Chen then defeats him. Finally, Chen corners Suzuki inside his office. Suzuki uses a Katana to fight back but he is no match for Chen, who is armed with a Nunchaku. In the dramatic ending of the fight scene, Chen sends Suzuki soaring out of the room with a flying kick and kills him, thus avenging his master's death. Chen returns to Jingwu School and finds that many of his fellow students have been killed during the Japanese's raid, although all of the raiders have been killed in the fight as well. After Chen overhears threats on the Jingwu school from a Japanese policeman, he volunteers himself to be arrested so as to protect his master's legacy. Chen speaks to the inspector in private and is assured that Jingwu School will prevail after he leaves. In the final scene, Chen charges and makes a flying kick at a line of armed soldiers just before they open fire at him, suggesting that the soldiers killed him.

24227817Yosuke is a high school student in Tokyo, Japan. He spends most of his free time sitting outside near a floodgate and playing a short tune on his acoustic guitar - the same few notes every time. He is usually joined by a girl in his class, Yu, who simply sits near him and listens to his music. Yu has a crush on Yosuke but does not tell him. After listening to him play the guitar, she goes home and hums the notes to her older sister. Her older sister used to have a serious boyfriend, but he has died recently, and she is still mourning for him. One day, Yosuke asks Yu about her sister. He is attracted to Yu's sister, and Yu sets up a few meetings between them. He also gets Yu to wear her sister's old school uniform for a day. While talking with Yosuke after school, Yu finally kisses him, but Yosuke just walks away; Yu is left there, crying. Yosuke keeps meeting Yu's sister, but before one meeting, Yu's sister gets hit by a truck while walking over to see him. She goes into a coma. Yu and Yosuke visit her at the hospital, and on their way home, Yu tells Yosuke that she wants to hear his song on the guitar when he finishes it. The two do not see each other again for 17 years. During that time, Yosuke enters the music production business and eventually gives up his guitar playing. He lives alone in an apartment. One day, he sees an intoxicated woman lying in the street and a man standing over her. Yosuke stares at the man, presumably a robber, and the man walks away. Yosuke goes into the studio a few days later and listens as a woman records some music on her guitar. During a break in recording, she looks at him and plays a few notes from the song he made in his school days. He realizes that the woman is Yu. After catching up, the two go back to Yosuke's apartment and drink sake. Eventually, Yosuke asks about Yu's sister and finds out that she is still in a coma. Yu starts to cry, and Yosuke comforts her. They then kiss each other for the second time in their lives. Afterwards, they visit Yu's sister at the hospital, and Yu leaves at the train station. Yosuke looks her up in the phone book and calls to say that he wants to play the finished song for her. They set up a meeting. On the way there, Yosuke gets stabbed by the same man who before had planned to rob the drunk woman. Yosuke lies in the street, bleeding, while Yu waits for him. Yosuke ends up in the hospital. Yu sits there by his side, and when he finally regains consciousness, she whispers, ""I love you."" Yosuke then replies that he loves her, too.

His life reaches a turning point when he is notified of the death of his aunt living in England, who named him her sole heir. Mario rushes to England, and learns that his inheritance consists of thirteen antique chairs. He sells them in order to cover his transportation costs, but soon learns from his aunt's last message, that inside one of the chairs is a fortune in jewels. He tries to buy back the chairs but is unsuccessful in doing so. With the help of a lovely antiques dealer living in London named Pat, the two then set out on a bizarre quest to track down the chairs that takes them from London to Rome.

The bizarre chase ends in Rome, where the chair containing the money finds its way into a truck, and is collected by nuns who auction it off to charity. With nothing much left to do as a result of the failure in his quest, Mario travels back to New York City by ship, as Pat sees him off and waves goodbye to him.

2808281The Joker and the Penguin break out of Arkham Asylum and race each other to find a stash of stolen money hidden within a crypt in Gotham Cemetery. The Joker is quickly intercepted by the Batman and is electrocuted when he falls into a river by his super-charged joy buzzers while the Penguin takes the opportunity to enter the cemetery himself. While searching through a crypt, the Penguin accidentally cuts his hand while using his umbrella-sword to open a coffin he hopes contains the money, finding a body instead. The blood from his hand drips on the corpse's heart, which brings it to life; it is none other than the vampire lord Count Dracula, his body having been moved from Transylvania to Gotham City after his ""death."" After attacking and turning a watchman at the cemetery into a vampire, Dracula hypnotizes the Penguin into becoming his non-vampiric servant so that he may lead him through Gotham to feed and guard his coffin during the day while he regains his strength. While patrolling the city, the Batman witnesses a vampire attack, but decides to put the incident at the back of his mind and, as Bruce Wayne, proceeds to host a corporate party at his manor. The invigorated Dracula appears at the party, disguised as a cultural anthropologist under the name Dr.""Alucard"",  claiming to be visiting to study the Batman , and takes an interest in Vicki Vale, a reporter who is interviewing and dating Bruce. After failing to turn Bruce into a vampire to quench his thirst, Dracula turns a waiter into a vampire that assaults Bruce's butler Alfred. Realizing the imminent danger, Bruce immediately deduces ""Alucard"" is Dracula. Upon further research, Bruce learns that Dracula is behind the disappearances of several Gotham citizens, who have been dubbed ""Lost Ones"" by the media and turned into vampires, and attempts to find a way to synthesize a vaccine for the victims. Due to eyewitnesses claiming to see a bat-like figure during the attacks, however, it is mistakenly reported that the Batman is behind the disappearances instead. When Batman goes to Gotham Cemetery to look for Dracula, he gets chased down by a SWAT unit, all of whose members are taken by Dracula as they chase him back into the city. During a fight with the Batman, Dracula offers him to join him in his conquest of Gotham, though the Batman naturally refuses. Just as Dracula has the Batman at his mercy, the sun rises and Dracula is forced to retreat, vowing to kill Batman for rejecting his offer. At the cemetery, the Joker reappears alive and well and confronts the Penguin, saying the shock to his head helped. He asks where the treasure is, thinking Penguin has already found it, chasing him into Dracula's tomb. However, despite Penguin's warning to not to open Dracula's coffin, Joker ends up ""breakfast in bed, freshly-squeezed"" for Dracula. The Batman tracks down the vampire Joker as he feasts in a blood bank and captures him. While the Batman attempts to concoct an antidote from the Joker's infected cellular structure, Alfred discovers that Dracula once had a vampire bride, Carmilla Karnstein, who met her demise when she was exposed to sunlight. During his research, however, Bruce stands up an understanding Vicki, who is soon kidnapped by Dracula. Finally, the Batman is able to cure the Joker of his vampirism and ascertain the location of Dracula's lair in Gotham Cemetery before returning him to Arkham. He then proceeds to mass-produce the vaccine to defeat Dracula and cure his victims. Dracula attempts to sacrifice Vicki's soul to reanimate his bride Carmilla. Upon learning that Vicki has been kidnapped, the Batman rushes to Dracula's lair with his anti-vampirism vaccine and arsenal of weapons, defeating and curing all the ""Lost Ones"" that attack him in the catacombs beneath Gotham Cemetery. The Batman then frees Vicki, disrupting the reanimation ritual. Dracula sends the Penguin to recapture Vicki while he fights the Batman, who lures Dracula into the Batcave and towards his prototype solar energy-storing machine and incinerates him with the sunlight stored within, reducing Dracula to a pile of ash and bones. This also frees the Penguin from his control who, while chasing Vicki, finally finds the hidden treasure that caused all the trouble in the first place. Sadly for Penguin, he is arrested and blamed for Dracula's kidnappings, causing the media to think he was forcing people to find the treasure. Having defeated an ultimate evil, the Batman triumphantly continues his duties to defend Gotham against anyone who may threaten its safety.

Keen to fly, he has applied for entry to the Air Force Academy. During a routine background check on Jeff, FBI agent Roy Parmenter  finds contradictory information on his parents, making him suspect that all is not as it should be. Further investigations reveal that they may be 'sleeper' agents for the Soviet Union with a teenager son, Jeff Nicholas. Unable to arrest them as they haven't actually done anything yet, Roy continues his investigation, and moves into the house across the street from the Grant family. He worms his way into their confidence. He eventually confronts Jeff with his suspicions and seeks Jeff's cooperation to learn more about his family. Initially unbelieving, Jeff is soon forced to accept the facts and discovers that even his own name is fictitious, his real name is Nikita. Roy confides to Jeff that twenty years earlier, his partner was killed by a Soviet agent, known only as 'Scuba' , and that he's still at large. It transpires that 'Scuba' is now a rogue agent, killing KGB agents one by one, including ""sleepers"". Meanwhile, a spy-catcher, Konstantin Karpov , has been sent from the Soviet embassy in Mexico to 'reel in' Scuba. Jeff is captured and held as a hostage at gunpoint by Karpov, as he and 'Scuba' make their way to the Mexican border on the San Diego Trolley.

When the villagers return home, they find that every single woman and child in the village has been slaughtered in the church by bats. Falsely accused of rape by the spurned burgomasters' daughter, libertine Paul Carlson flees the Kleinenberg authorities by jumping into a nearby coach which, though driverless, heads off at great speed. He is deposited near Count Dracula's mountaintop castle. Initially he is welcomed by the Count and a beautiful woman. Paul later has a liaison with the woman who concludes their lovemaking by trying to bite his neck. Dracula enters and, casually throwing off Paul's efforts to stop him, savagely stabs the woman to death. Dracula's servant Klove dismembers her body and dissolves the pieces in a bath of either holy water or acid. Trapped in a room high in the castle, Paul uses a line to climb down to a lower window but the line is withdrawn and he is trapped in a dark doorless room. Paul's more sober brother Simon Carlson and Paul's fiancee Sarah Framsen come searching for him. A maid at the tavern directs them to the castle and they investigate. Dracula has immediate designs on the lovely Sarah, but Klove, who has fallen in love with the young woman, helps the young couple escape by refusing to do Dracula's bidding to remove Sarah's crucifix. The servant pays a terrible price for his disobedience, when he is viciously whipped by Dracula with a red-hot sword. Simon, having enlisted the help of the village priest, goes back to the castle to look for his brother. However, the priest is attacked by a large bat and killed and Simon is betrayed by Klove, ending up in the same doorless room as his brother. Opening a coffin in the middle of the room, Simon discovers the sleeping Dracula, but the vampire's power reaches through his closed eyelids causing the young man to collapse before he can take action against the Count. When Simon recovers, Dracula is awake and climbs up the sheer outer wall to go after Sarah, knowing that Simon is trapped. Meanwhile, Simon finds his brother's body in a dark recess of the room, impaled on a metal spike. Sarah has made her way back to the castle and is confronted by Dracula, who this time uses his bat familiar to remove Sarah's crucifix. Klove frees Simon and the two go up to the battlements to try and save Sarah from Dracula. Klove attacks the Count, but is hopelessly outmatched and thrown over the side of the castle. Simon arrives and throws a heavy iron spike at Dracula. It pierces him but he pulls it out, unharmed, and raises it to impale Simon. But the spike is struck by lightning and Dracula, in flames, falls from the castle wall. The end, for now.

His life reaches a turning point when he is notified of the death of his aunt living in England, who named him her sole heir. Mario rushes to England, and learns that his inheritance consists of thirteen antique chairs. He sells them in order to cover his transportation costs, but soon learns from his aunt's last message, that inside one of the chairs is a fortune in jewels. He tries to buy back the chairs but is unsuccessful in doing so. With the help of a lovely antiques dealer living in London named Pat, the two then set out on a bizarre quest to track down the chairs that takes them from London to Rome. Along the way, they meet a bunch of equally bizarre characters such as a driver of a furniture moving van named Albert; a prostitute named Judy; Maurice, the leader of a traveling theater company that stages a poor version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde; the Italian entrepreneur Carlo Di Seta; and his vivacious daughter Stefanella. The bizarre chase ends in Rome, where the chair containing the money finds its way into a truck, and is collected by nuns who auction it off to charity.

2808281The Joker and the Penguin break out of Arkham Asylum and race each other to find a stash of stolen money hidden within a crypt in Gotham Cemetery. The Joker is quickly intercepted by the Batman and is electrocuted when he falls into a river by his super-charged joy buzzers while the Penguin takes the opportunity to enter the cemetery himself. While searching through a crypt, the Penguin accidentally cuts his hand while using his umbrella-sword to open a coffin he hopes contains the money, finding a body instead. The blood from his hand drips on the corpse's heart, which brings it to life; it is none other than the vampire lord Count Dracula, his body having been moved from Transylvania to Gotham City after his ""death."" After attacking and turning a watchman at the cemetery into a vampire, Dracula hypnotizes the Penguin into becoming his non-vampiric servant so that he may lead him through Gotham to feed and guard his coffin during the day while he regains his strength. While patrolling the city, the Batman witnesses a vampire attack, but decides to put the incident at the back of his mind and, as Bruce Wayne, proceeds to host a corporate party at his manor. The invigorated Dracula appears at the party, disguised as a cultural anthropologist under the name Dr.""Alucard"",  claiming to be visiting to study the Batman , and takes an interest in Vicki Vale, a reporter who is interviewing and dating Bruce. After failing to turn Bruce into a vampire to quench his thirst, Dracula turns a waiter into a vampire that assaults Bruce's butler Alfred. Realizing the imminent danger, Bruce immediately deduces ""Alucard"" is Dracula. Upon further research, Bruce learns that Dracula is behind the disappearances of several Gotham citizens, who have been dubbed ""Lost Ones"" by the media and turned into vampires, and attempts to find a way to synthesize a vaccine for the victims. Due to eyewitnesses claiming to see a bat-like figure during the attacks, however, it is mistakenly reported that the Batman is behind the disappearances instead. When Batman goes to Gotham Cemetery to look for Dracula, he gets chased down by a SWAT unit, all of whose members are taken by Dracula as they chase him back into the city. During a fight with the Batman, Dracula offers him to join him in his conquest of Gotham, though the Batman naturally refuses. Just as Dracula has the Batman at his mercy, the sun rises and Dracula is forced to retreat, vowing to kill Batman for rejecting his offer. At the cemetery, the Joker reappears alive and well and confronts the Penguin, saying the shock to his head helped. He asks where the treasure is, thinking Penguin has already found it, chasing him into Dracula's tomb. However, despite Penguin's warning to not to open Dracula's coffin, Joker ends up ""breakfast in bed, freshly-squeezed"" for Dracula. The Batman tracks down the vampire Joker as he feasts in a blood bank and captures him. While the Batman attempts to concoct an antidote from the Joker's infected cellular structure, Alfred discovers that Dracula once had a vampire bride, Carmilla Karnstein, who met her demise when she was exposed to sunlight. During his research, however, Bruce stands up an understanding Vicki, who is soon kidnapped by Dracula. Finally, the Batman is able to cure the Joker of his vampirism and ascertain the location of Dracula's lair in Gotham Cemetery before returning him to Arkham. He then proceeds to mass-produce the vaccine to defeat Dracula and cure his victims. Dracula attempts to sacrifice Vicki's soul to reanimate his bride Carmilla. Upon learning that Vicki has been kidnapped, the Batman rushes to Dracula's lair with his anti-vampirism vaccine and arsenal of weapons, defeating and curing all the ""Lost Ones"" that attack him in the catacombs beneath Gotham Cemetery. The Batman then frees Vicki, disrupting the reanimation ritual. Dracula sends the Penguin to recapture Vicki while he fights the Batman, who lures Dracula into the Batcave and towards his prototype solar energy-storing machine and incinerates him with the sunlight stored within, reducing Dracula to a pile of ash and bones. This also frees the Penguin from his control who, while chasing Vicki, finally finds the hidden treasure that caused all the trouble in the first place. Sadly for Penguin, he is arrested and blamed for Dracula's kidnappings, causing the media to think he was forcing people to find the treasure. Having defeated an ultimate evil, the Batman triumphantly continues his duties to defend Gotham against anyone who may threaten its safety.

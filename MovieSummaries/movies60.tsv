3402601Kim Possible  is a high-school cheerleader and world-famous crimefighter, and Ron Stoppable  is her faithful sidekick. Ron has a pet naked mole rat named Rufus . The film begins at the start of a new school year, but the start of a fun year is ruined when Ron finds out he's moving to Norway. Meanwhile, Dr. Drakken, Shego, Duff Killigan, and Monkey Fist team up to steal the Time Monkey, a small statuette used to travel through time. With help from her computer guru Wade Load  and her friend Monique, Kim follows the villains to Australia as they steal the body and head of the Time Monkey, but the villains connect the head to the body inside the Time Monkey's temple in Africa, and they escape through the resulting time portal. Shortly afterward, Kim is visited by a large talking mole rat from the future, a descendent of Rufus named Rufus 3000, who gives Kim a time-travel device and explains that ""The Supreme One"" is preparing to take over the world. Meanwhile, Drakken, Killigan, and Monkey Fist turn themselves into little children and travel back in time to Kim's first day in preschool in order to discourage her from becoming a crimefighter. Posing as her schoolmates, the villains try to bully the four-year-old Kim, but she defeats them and makes friends with Ron, and the high-school-age Kim arrives to fight Shego, who has been observing her accomplices. With their preschool plot foiled, the villains turn back into adults and escape forward in time, to a day when Kim and Ron are middle-school teenagers. When a billionaire traps himself in the web of deadly laser beams that guard his vault, his security expert accidentally contacts Kim through her new babysitting website, so, after a neighbor drives Kim and Ron to the billionaire's mansion, Kim uses her cheerleading gymnastic skills to jump through the laser beams and save the billionaire. Monkey Fist goes into the past and retrieves a huge rock gorilla, which attacks Kim, but high-school-age Kim and Ron appear, and high-school Ron destroys the rock gorilla by accidentally activating the security lasers. As police officers arrest Drakken, Killigan, and Monkey Fist, Shego, after being visited by her future self while watching the fight, escapes with the Time Monkey into the future. Rufus 3000 then arrives and reveals to Kim that Shego is the Supreme One, not Drakken stating that he thought it was obvious to her since Shego is the only one smart enough to actually take over the world. Kim then activates the time portal and her, Ron, Rufus, and Rufus 3000 go to the future to stop her.  In the future, Shego has become dictator of the world and made everyone her slaves. Kim and Ron are captured and sent to their old high school to be brainwashed, but they are rescued by Kim's twin brothers Tim and Jim, along with Rufus 3000 and an army of naked mole rats. The twins take Kim and Ron to the secret headquarters of the political resistance movement, whose leader is Wade. Together, they and all of the Rufuses sneak into Shego's castle, where they fight their way past the villains and an army of monkeys to the room where Shego keeps the Time Monkey. After capturing Kim and her friends, Shego reveals that she separated Kim and Ron by making money in the 1990s stock-market boom, buying the company that Ron's mother worked for, and having her transferred to Norway, her reason being that while together, Kim and Ron actually made a decent team, but if they were apart, they couldn't stop her. In his anger at having to live in Norway and the destruction of his favorite nacho restaurant, Ron throws Drakken across the room. The twins break out of their chains, the pillars that hold up the palace ceiling collapse, and the Time Monkey falls to the floor and breaks, undoing all the effects of Shego's time travel. This causes Kim, Ron, and Rufus to float through a time portal and travel back to the first scene of the film, at the end of their first school day. At the moment when the first time disturbance occurred, a wave of time distortion washes over Kim and Ron, and when the moment has passed, the world has been restored to its original state and the two teens have lost all memory of the film's events, except that Ron knows he hates meat cakes, which he was forced to eat in Norway.

When one of the bottles begins to emit an eerie supernatural glow, Mears tells Petrie ""They've found us again."" The story then flashes back two years, to the small town of Salem's Lot  in Maine in the United States. Ben Mears, an author, has returned to the town after a long absence to write a book about the Marsten House, an ominous old property on a hilltop which has a reputation for being haunted. Mears attempts to rent the house but finds that another new arrival in town, the mysterious Richard Straker, has recently bought it. Straker also opens an antique shop with his oft-mentioned but always absent business partner, Kurt Barlow. Meanwhile, Mears moves into a boarding house in town run by Eva Miller, and develops a romantic relationship with a local woman, Susan Norton. He befriends Susan's father, Dr. Bill Norton, and also renews his old friendship with his former school teacher, Jason Burke.

After a large crate is delivered to the Marsten House one night, an increasing number of the townsfolk begin to disappear or die in strange circumstances.

In turn, Danny kills the local gravedigger Mike Ryerson who was bothered by Danny's open eyes and then attempts to kill his schoolfriend Mark Petrie. However, Mark is a horror film buff who manages to repel Danny with a crucifix.

Jason Burke, however, falls prey to a heart attack following an encounter with the newly vampirised Mike Ryerson. In the end, Susan Norton and Mark Petrie are captured by Straker after breaking into the Marsten House. Armed with wooden stakes and holy water, Mears and Dr. Norton head over to the house to destroy Barlow when they run into Mark who has managed to escape. Inside the house, Dr. Norton is killed by Straker, who is himself then killed by Mears using a pistol. Afterwards, Mears and Petrie find Barlow's coffin in the cellar and destroy him by driving a stake through his heart. They then escape from the other vampires in the cellar , and set fire to the house. However, Susan is nowhere to be found. As the house burns, the wind begins to carry the fire towards the town itself. Mears and Petrie then flee Salem's Lot knowing that the fire will drive all the other vampires from their hiding places and purify the town from the evil that has engulfed it. The story then returns to Mears and Petrie at the church in Guatemala two years later. It quickly becomes clear that they are on the run from the surviving vampires from Salem's Lot, who have been relentlessly pursuing them. Their supplies of holy water glow whenever a vampire is nearby. Realising that they have been tracked down yet again, Mears and Petrie return to their lodgings to collect their belongings. However, once there, Mears finds Susan lying in his bed. Now a vampire, she prepares to bite him as he leans down to kiss her, but he drives a stake through her heart.

Adam and Paul wake up sick in the middle of a field with Adam glued to a mattress. They make their way into town via a run-in with a terrified and terrifying drug dealer named Martin in Flat 63 of Ballymun Housing, a hasty exit from the top deck of a bus, a long trudge down the median of a dual carriageway and an incident with a moped that injures Paul's leg.

433824On Christmas Eve, one year after the Nakatomi Tower Incident, John McClane is waiting at Washington Dulles International Airport for his wife Holly to arrive from Los Angeles, California. Reporter Richard Thornburg, who exposed Holly's identity to Hans Gruber in the first Die Hard, is assigned a seat across the aisle from her. While in the airport bar, McClane spots two men in army fatigues carrying a package; one of the men has a gun. Suspicious, he follows them into the baggage area. After a shootout, he kills one of the men while the other escapes. Learning the dead man is a mercenary thought to have been killed in action, McClane believes he's stumbled onto a nefarious plot. He relates his suspicions to airport police Captain Carmine Lorenzo, but Lorenzo refuses to listen and has McClane thrown out of his office. Former U.S. Army Special Forces Colonel Stuart and other members of his unit set up a base in a church near Dulles after executing the church's custodian. They take over the air traffic control systems, cutting off communication to the planes, and seize control of the airport. Their goal is to rescue General Ramon Esperanza, a drug lord and the dictator of Val Verde, who is being extradited to the United States to stand trial on drug trafficking charges. They demand a Boeing 747 so they can escape to another country, and warn the airport's controllers not to try to restore control. Upon learning of this, McClane realizes his wife is on one of the planes circling above Washington, D.C. with too little fuel to be redirected, and will likely crash if the terrorists remain in control. He prepares to fight the terrorists. Dulles communications director Leslie Barnes heads to the unfinished Annex Skywalk with a SWAT team to re-establish communications with the planes. Stuart's henchmen, disguised as painters, maintenance employees, and airport staff, ambush them. In the resulting shootout, all the SWAT officers are killed, as is one of Stuart's men. Before they can shoot Barnes, McClane bursts in through an air vent. After a shootout, McClane kills the rest of Stuart's men. When Stuart learns of this, he responds by recalibrating the instrument landing system and then impersonating air traffic controllers to crash a jet, killing all 230 passengers and crew on board the aircraft. In response, a U.S. Army Special Forces team is called in, led by Major Grant. A two-way radio dropped by one of Stuart's henchmen tips McClane that Esperanza is landing. McClane gets there before Stuart's henchmen, but Stuart traps him in Esperanza's transport plane and throws grenades into the cockpit. McClane escapes via the ejection seat just as the aircraft explodes. Barnes is then able to help McClane locate the mercenaries' hideout and they tell Grant and his team to raid the location. However, the mercenaries escape on snowmobiles during a shootout between Grant's team and Stuart's team. McClane pursues them, killing two more mercenaries and taking a snowmobile, but the gun he picked up does not work. He realizes that the gun contained blanks and that the mercenaries and Special Forces are working together. McClane contacts Lorenzo to send out officers to intercept the Boeing 747 in which the mercenaries are planning to escape, proving his story by firing at Lorenzo with the blank gun. Thornburg, after learning about the situation through a radio transmission from Barnes, barricades himself in the airplane lavatory and phones in a sensational and exaggerated take on what is happening at Dulles, leading to panic in the airport and preventing the officers from reaching the plane. After learning of this, Holly enters the lavatory and subdues Thornburg with a taser. McClane hitches a ride on a news helicopter that drops him off on the left wing of the mercenary plane and he blocks the ailerons with his jacket, preventing the plane from taking off. Grant emerges and fights McClane, but is sucked into the jet engine and killed. Stuart comes out to fight next, and succeeds in knocking McClane off the plane, but not before McClane knocks open the fuel hatch. After landing, McClane uses his cigarette lighter to ignite the trail of leaking fuel, which races down the runway to the wing, ignites the rest of the fuel and destroys the jet, killing all on board. The passenger planes, circling in the air, use the lighted trail to land, and McClane and his wife are reunited.

Though fearless, unselfish, and very beautiful, the young queen faces many challenges. As in neighbouring England, the Protestant faith has been embraced by many nobles of Scotland; in addition, the Catholic Mary has to deal with her half-brother James Stewart, Lord Moray's  ambitions for rule. He suggests that Mary enjoy herself in Scotland, and pass the time with dancing and feasting. Moray wants to rule Scotland while the lovely but inexperienced Mary becomes a figurehead. Fearing that Mary has ambitions for England's throne, Elizabeth I of England  decides to weaken her claim by sending her favourite, the ambitious Robert Dudley ([[Daniel Massey , to woo and marry Mary.

Tempted by the handsome Darnley, Mary impulsively chooses him for marriage. Lord Moray, a Protestant, opposes the marriage, but Mary ignores him. She even exiles Moray to strengthen her own authority. Elizabeth is satisfied that reckless, passionate Mary's romantic misadventures will keep her busy in Scotland and give shrewd, practical Elizabeth less to worry about. Soon after the wedding, Darnley throws a childish temper tantrum, complaining that he has no real power and is merely Mary's King Consort. A disillusioned Mary soon banishes Darnley from her bed and frequently consults with the gentle, soft-spoken Italian courtier David Riccio . Darnley had previously had him as a lover and accuses him of fathering Mary's expected child.

She also fears that Mary's death might spark a rebellion by her Catholic subjects and cause problems with powerful France and Spain. As a result Mary is doomed to an open-ended captivity. Over time the once proud Queen of Scots succumbs to an empty routine, plotting half-heartedly to escape but growing increasingly comfortable in her luxurious seclusion.

When one of the bottles begins to emit an eerie supernatural glow, Mears tells Petrie ""They've found us again."" The story then flashes back two years, to the small town of Salem's Lot  in Maine in the United States. Ben Mears, an author, has returned to the town after a long absence to write a book about the Marsten House, an ominous old property on a hilltop which has a reputation for being haunted. Mears attempts to rent the house but finds that another new arrival in town, the mysterious Richard Straker, has recently bought it. Straker also opens an antique shop with his oft-mentioned but always absent business partner, Kurt Barlow. Meanwhile, Mears moves into a boarding house in town run by Eva Miller, and develops a romantic relationship with a local woman, Susan Norton. He befriends Susan's father, Dr. Bill Norton, and also renews his old friendship with his former school teacher, Jason Burke. Mears tells Burke that he feels the Marsten House is somehow inherently evil, and recalls how he was once traumatized in the house when he was a child. After a large crate is delivered to the Marsten House one night, an increasing number of the townsfolk begin to disappear or die in strange circumstances. Both Mears and Straker are initially the main suspects as they are new in town, but it becomes clear that the crate contained Straker's mysterious business partner, Kurt Barlow, an ancient master vampire who has come to the town after having sent Straker to make way for his arrival. Straker kills a young local boy, Ralphie Glick, as an offering to Barlow, while Barlow himself kills local realtor Larry Crockett after he is chased out of the home of Bonnie Sawyer by Bonnie's husband. The Glick boy then returns as a vampire to claim his brother, Danny, who himself becomes undead. In turn, Danny kills the local gravedigger Mike Ryerson who was bothered by Danny's open eyes and then attempts to kill his schoolfriend Mark Petrie. However, Mark is a horror film buff who manages to repel Danny with a crucifix. Slowly, the vampires spread as Mears and Burke figure out what is happening to the town and attempt to do something to stop it. Mark's parents are both killed by Barlow, though Mark is allowed to escape when the local priest, Father Callahan, sacrifices himself to Barlow. Jason Burke, however, falls prey to a heart attack following an encounter with the newly vampirised Mike Ryerson. In the end, Susan Norton and Mark Petrie are captured by Straker after breaking into the Marsten House. Armed with wooden stakes and holy water, Mears and Dr. Norton head over to the house to destroy Barlow when they run into Mark who has managed to escape. Inside the house, Dr. Norton is killed by Straker, who is himself then killed by Mears using a pistol. Afterwards, Mears and Petrie find Barlow's coffin in the cellar and destroy him by driving a stake through his heart. They then escape from the other vampires in the cellar , and set fire to the house. However, Susan is nowhere to be found. As the house burns, the wind begins to carry the fire towards the town itself. Mears and Petrie then flee Salem's Lot knowing that the fire will drive all the other vampires from their hiding places and purify the town from the evil that has engulfed it. The story then returns to Mears and Petrie at the church in Guatemala two years later. It quickly becomes clear that they are on the run from the surviving vampires from Salem's Lot, who have been relentlessly pursuing them. Their supplies of holy water glow whenever a vampire is nearby. Realising that they have been tracked down yet again, Mears and Petrie return to their lodgings to collect their belongings. However, once there, Mears finds Susan lying in his bed. Now a vampire, she prepares to bite him as he leans down to kiss her, but he drives a stake through her heart.

433824On Christmas Eve, one year after the Nakatomi Tower Incident, John McClane is waiting at Washington Dulles International Airport for his wife Holly to arrive from Los Angeles, California. Reporter Richard Thornburg, who exposed Holly's identity to Hans Gruber in the first Die Hard, is assigned a seat across the aisle from her. While in the airport bar, McClane spots two men in army fatigues carrying a package; one of the men has a gun. Suspicious, he follows them into the baggage area. After a shootout, he kills one of the men while the other escapes. Learning the dead man is a mercenary thought to have been killed in action, McClane believes he's stumbled onto a nefarious plot. He relates his suspicions to airport police Captain Carmine Lorenzo, but Lorenzo refuses to listen and has McClane thrown out of his office. Former U.S. Army Special Forces Colonel Stuart and other members of his unit set up a base in a church near Dulles after executing the church's custodian. They take over the air traffic control systems, cutting off communication to the planes, and seize control of the airport. Their goal is to rescue General Ramon Esperanza, a drug lord and the dictator of Val Verde, who is being extradited to the United States to stand trial on drug trafficking charges. They demand a Boeing 747 so they can escape to another country, and warn the airport's controllers not to try to restore control. Upon learning of this, McClane realizes his wife is on one of the planes circling above Washington, D.C. with too little fuel to be redirected, and will likely crash if the terrorists remain in control. He prepares to fight the terrorists. Dulles communications director Leslie Barnes heads to the unfinished Annex Skywalk with a SWAT team to re-establish communications with the planes. Stuart's henchmen, disguised as painters, maintenance employees, and airport staff, ambush them. In the resulting shootout, all the SWAT officers are killed, as is one of Stuart's men. Before they can shoot Barnes, McClane bursts in through an air vent. After a shootout, McClane kills the rest of Stuart's men. When Stuart learns of this, he responds by recalibrating the instrument landing system and then impersonating air traffic controllers to crash a jet, killing all 230 passengers and crew on board the aircraft. In response, a U.S. Army Special Forces team is called in, led by Major Grant. A two-way radio dropped by one of Stuart's henchmen tips McClane that Esperanza is landing. McClane gets there before Stuart's henchmen, but Stuart traps him in Esperanza's transport plane and throws grenades into the cockpit. McClane escapes via the ejection seat just as the aircraft explodes. Barnes is then able to help McClane locate the mercenaries' hideout and they tell Grant and his team to raid the location. However, the mercenaries escape on snowmobiles during a shootout between Grant's team and Stuart's team. McClane pursues them, killing two more mercenaries and taking a snowmobile, but the gun he picked up does not work. He realizes that the gun contained blanks and that the mercenaries and Special Forces are working together. McClane contacts Lorenzo to send out officers to intercept the Boeing 747 in which the mercenaries are planning to escape, proving his story by firing at Lorenzo with the blank gun. Thornburg, after learning about the situation through a radio transmission from Barnes, barricades himself in the airplane lavatory and phones in a sensational and exaggerated take on what is happening at Dulles, leading to panic in the airport and preventing the officers from reaching the plane. After learning of this, Holly enters the lavatory and subdues Thornburg with a taser. McClane hitches a ride on a news helicopter that drops him off on the left wing of the mercenary plane and he blocks the ailerons with his jacket, preventing the plane from taking off. Grant emerges and fights McClane, but is sucked into the jet engine and killed. Stuart comes out to fight next, and succeeds in knocking McClane off the plane, but not before McClane knocks open the fuel hatch. After landing, McClane uses his cigarette lighter to ignite the trail of leaking fuel, which races down the runway to the wing, ignites the rest of the fuel and destroys the jet, killing all on board. The passenger planes, circling in the air, use the lighted trail to land, and McClane and his wife are reunited.

Though fearless, unselfish, and very beautiful, the young queen faces many challenges. As in neighbouring England, the Protestant faith has been embraced by many nobles of Scotland; in addition, the Catholic Mary has to deal with her half-brother James Stewart, Lord Moray's  ambitions for rule. He suggests that Mary enjoy herself in Scotland, and pass the time with dancing and feasting. Moray wants to rule Scotland while the lovely but inexperienced Mary becomes a figurehead. Fearing that Mary has ambitions for England's throne, Elizabeth I of England  decides to weaken her claim by sending her favourite, the ambitious Robert Dudley ([[Daniel Massey , to woo and marry Mary. She promises that Mary will become her heir if she agrees to the marriage. Sly Elizabeth also sends the younger, dashing but weak Lord Darnley , from a powerful Catholic family. Tempted by the handsome Darnley, Mary impulsively chooses him for marriage. Lord Moray, a Protestant, opposes the marriage, but Mary ignores him. She even exiles Moray to strengthen her own authority. Elizabeth is satisfied that reckless, passionate Mary's romantic misadventures will keep her busy in Scotland and give shrewd, practical Elizabeth less to worry about. Soon after the wedding, Darnley throws a childish temper tantrum, complaining that he has no real power and is merely Mary's King Consort. A disillusioned Mary soon banishes Darnley from her bed and frequently consults with the gentle, soft-spoken Italian courtier David Riccio . Darnley had previously had him as a lover and accuses him of fathering Mary's expected child.

Elizabeth's closest advisor, Sir William Cecil , is anxious to get rid of Mary, but Elizabeth fears to set a precedent by putting an anointed monarch to death. She also fears that Mary's death might spark a rebellion by her Catholic subjects and cause problems with powerful France and Spain. As a result Mary is doomed to an open-ended captivity. Over time the once proud Queen of Scots succumbs to an empty routine, plotting half-heartedly to escape but growing increasingly comfortable in her luxurious seclusion. She occupies herself with a lazy daily schedule of cards, embroidery and gossip, talking vaguely of escape yet sleeping later and later each morning. Yet while the helpless imprisoned queen has lost all will to harm her enemies, they continue to plot her final destruction. With the help of his associate Walsingham ([[Richard Warner , Cecil finds evidence of Mary's involvement in the conspiracy to assassinate Elizabeth known as the Babington Plot.

Meanwhile, Drakken, Killigan, and Monkey Fist turn themselves into little children and travel back in time to Kim's first day in preschool in order to discourage her from becoming a crimefighter.

With their preschool plot foiled, the villains turn back into adults and escape forward in time, to a day when Kim and Ron are middle-school teenagers.

Together, they and all of the Rufuses sneak into Shego's castle, where they fight their way past the villains and an army of monkeys to the room where Shego keeps the Time Monkey. After capturing Kim and her friends, Shego reveals that she separated Kim and Ron by making money in the 1990s stock-market boom, buying the company that Ron's mother worked for, and having her transferred to Norway, her reason being that while together, Kim and Ron actually made a decent team, but if they were apart, they couldn't stop her. In his anger at having to live in Norway and the destruction of his favorite nacho restaurant, Ron throws Drakken across the room. The twins break out of their chains, the pillars that hold up the palace ceiling collapse, and the Time Monkey falls to the floor and breaks, undoing all the effects of Shego's time travel. This causes Kim, Ron, and Rufus to float through a time portal and travel back to the first scene of the film, at the end of their first school day.

As captain Aubrey looks through his telescope at the fog, he sees cannonfire, and the ship is ambushed by Acheron, a ship twice as large as the British warship. Surprise is heavily damaged, while its own cannon fire does not penetrate the enemy ship's hull. Later in the battle, Surprise's rudder is shot off and her helm is blown away, making the ship unsteerable, adding to the fact that the ship is taking water fast. Using smaller boats, the crew of Surprise tow the ship into a fog bank and evade pursuit. Aubrey learns from a crewman who saw Acheron being built that it is heavier and faster than Surprise, and the senior officers consider the ship out of their class. Aubrey notes that such a ship could tip the balance of power in Napoleon's favour if allowed to plunder the Brit"

Other characters include the village mayor and his wife Yvonne , the cafe-owner Amal , Rabih  and his sister, Issam  and his wife Aida, and the village priest and the village imam. The next day, the congregation is gathered in church to celebrate the Sunday mass; The Priest preaches about the need to fix the church, and blames the broken cross on the wind, telling churchgoers to keep their cool and that their fellow Muslims have nothing to do with it. Some time later the Imam discovers that some goats have found their ways into the mosque, and urges the Muslims not to blame the Christians for what had happened. As people starts to gather, however, a Muslim man blames the Christians for what has happened and a small fight ensues. The village is slowly drawn into greater violence; but the women get along beautifully and conspire together to keep their men from fighting, even hiring Ukrainian dancers to entertain their men. But as Nassim is killed in a skirmish between Christians and Muslims while on an errand in a nearby town, the women are faced with a real test of wills. In an attempt to control the situation, they drug the men by mixing hashish inside sweet pastries and remove their weapons from the village. This ensured that fighting would not resume in the village during or after Nassim's funeral.

At the beginning of the film, the father ([[John Corbett  gives his ill daughter a snow globe of a little girl holding a snow globe, and inside that globe is another little girl holding a snow globe. The mother  tells her daughter that she has to shake the globe to make it snow. The girl is fascinated with the snow, having never seen it before, and wishes that she could see it for Christmas. The father, hearing this, becomes concerned that his daughter may not live to see December. After the father quietly asks a neighboring farmer  about buying pumpkins - and later Christmas trees - the farmer figures out that the father is trying to speed up the holidays so that his daughter will have a Christmas before she dies. The farmer, searching for pumpkins to surprise the family, heals an old friendship that he'd lost when his own son had died, and is rewarded with an invitation to be his old friend's best man at the friend's upcoming wedding. Together, the two men sneak a truckload of pumpkins onto the family's front porch, much to the surprise of the daughter who decides she wants to have a Halloween party. The mother tries to explain that it's too early, but the father agrees to the party and the daughter  begin to plan their Halloween costumes. As a show of appreciation, the father goes to the farmer's home and invites him and his wife to the party. The farmer goes to town and mentions it to a young waitress  at the local restaurant whom the daughter had befriended. Later, the farmer gives the father a box of Halloween decorations to help decorate the family's house, and on the night of the party the waitress arrives with the town's children to help celebrate. The daughter - who was prohibited from going to school and meeting other children because of her illness - is overjoyed at having so many playmates. The farmer, his wife, and his friend and his new wife follow carrying trays of food. The waitress tries her skills as a storyteller and tells a ghost story that makes the children scream and laugh. Together, the farmer, his old friend, and the waitress help the family celebrate Halloween - and each holiday thereafter - a month early, and in doing so unite an entire community and teach everyone that what really matters in life is love. As the daughter and her family return home one night from a particularly sorrowful hospital visit, they find that the neighbors have decorated their homes and streets with brilliant lights and holiday decorations a full month early. The farmer, his friend, and the neighboring community line the family's driveway to greet the girl as she arrives home; her own house covered in beautiful lights. Everyone is invited inside the home to celebrate with food given by the town's local restaurant, and later, the little girl runs outside with her snow globe just as an early snow begins to fall, duplicating the little girl inside the globe. Tammy, the waitress and college student who befriends the young daughter, writes a children's book about the little girl's life, with pictures that the daughter had made herself during her illness. As a teenager reading Tammy's book to children at the local library, the daughter explains that she survived her illness after that early Christmas. Afterwards, she goes to the farmer's Christmas tree lot where she reunites with her family and the farmer; to select the town's annual tree.

In particular, the focus is on the relationship between the leaders themselves and the large strategic concerns at play, with little scrutiny given to the decisions taking place at a lower level{{cite web}} - an example of this is how, despite his personal disdain for communism, Churchill was willing to go to great lengths to aid the Soviet Union in their fight against Nazi Germany.

Attacked by a team of mercenaries led by Vargas , Wade is killed and Frost is forced to surrender himself to the American consulate in Cape Town, South Africa. Frost is transferred to a local safe house maintained by ""housekeeper"" Matt Weston , a low-level agent. Weston watches veteran agent Daniel Kiefer  begin to interrogate Frost via waterboarding. Vargas and his men attack the safe house, killing Kiefer and his team, as Weston manages to escape with Frost as his prisoner. Weston contacts his superior, David Barlow , at CIA headquarters in Langley. Catherine Linklater , another CIA operative, orders Weston to lie low and await instructions. Weston hides out with Frost and calls his girlfriend Ana Moreau , a French medical resident who does not know that he works for the CIA, and tells her to leave the house. Barlow later tells Weston to go to Cape Town Stadium to retrieve a GPS device with the location of a nearby safe house. He retrieves the GPS at the stadium, but Frost creates a diversion and escapes by disguising himself as a policeman. Weston, detained by the police, escapes but can't catch Frost. Weston is ordered to visit the nearest American embassy for debriefing. Instead he meets with Ana, where he reveals that he is a CIA agent and sends her back to Paris for her safety. He is able to track Frost to a shantytown in Langa, where Frost is meeting Carlos Villar , an old contact and document forger. Vargas attacks again and kills Villar, but Frost is able to escape with Weston's help. They learn that Vargas is actually working for the CIA, which is seeking to retrieve the storage device Frost received from Wade. The device is revealed to contain details of the corrupt dealings of the CIA, MI6, Mossad, and other intelligence agencies, and that Weston's own superiors may be implicated. Frost is taken to the new safe house by Weston, where Weston is attacked by the housekeeper, Keller . After much struggle, Weston kills Keller but is badly wounded in their fight. Frost leaves Weston who then passes out from the wounds sustained fighting Keller. Meanwhile, Linklater has arrived in South Africa with Barlow to collect Frost and Weston from the safe house, but on the way is shot and killed by Barlow, who goes to the safe house and reveals that he is Vargas' employer. He confirms that the file contains incriminating evidence against him, and encourages Weston to lie about what has happened. Frost returns to rescue Weston by killing Vargas and his men but is shot by Barlow. Weston then shoots Barlow in the chest, killing him. Frost gives Weston the file and tells Weston he is better than him before he dies from his injuries. Back in the U.S., Weston meets with CIA Deputy Director Harlan Whitford , who informs Weston that unflattering facts about the CIA must be removed from his report, but that he will be promoted. He asks Weston about the file's location but Weston denies having been told about it by Frost. Whitford states that whoever has those files will have many enemies. Weston leaves, then leaks the files to the media, incriminating personnel from many intelligence agencies, including Whitford. Later on, Weston sees Ana across a street in Paris, France. She reads a note passed to her from him, looks up at Weston, and they both make eye contact before he disappears."

29659855	/m/0gxz3rp	Sasquatch, the Legend of Bigfoot	1977-03-09		96	"{""/m/02h40lc"": ""English Language""}"	{}	"{""/m/02n4kr"": ""Mystery"", ""/m/03k9fj"": ""Adventure""}"	The film begins in the forest with shots of local wildlife, agitated and on alert, but the source is not seen on screen. The camera then switches to a first person view, hinting at an unseen presence and the scene culminates with the view of a large human-like creature's reflection at water's edge while a haunting wail echos through the forest. Opening credits are next, followed by a review of recent Bigfoot stories via newspaper clippings and narration. Next up is the well-known Patterson-Gimlin Film, shot by Roger Patterson on October 20, 1967, in Bluff Creek, CA which shows an ape-like creature walking along a dry creek bed. The narrator goes on to explain that by running statistical data through modern computers, a site in British Columbia has been determined as the most likely spot for a population of Sasquatch to live undisturbed. An expedition is mounted, hoping to verify the creature's existence and secure funding for future research into the phenomenon. The seven man team is composed of Native American guide Techka Blackhawk, seasoned wilderness explorer Josh Bigsby, wise-cracking reporter Bob Vernon, anthropologist Dr. Paul Markham, cook Barney Snipe, animal handler Hank Parshall and team leader Chuck Evans who also narrates the film. The team is on horseback and brings tracking dogs to aid in the hunt. As the film progresses, tales of Sasquatch encounters by earlier explorers are interwoven with the current expedition's adventure and told as campfire stories. These scenes are recreated by uncredited cast members and include the Ape Canyon incident in which miners are attacked while sleeping in their cabin and an encounter by early pioneer explorers Bauman and Jessup. Initially the expedition takes on the feel of a nature trek, but as we reach a scene where the team is traversing a hillside it takes on a more ominous feel. As rocks begin tumbling down towards them from above, Techka stops the caravan in time to avoid injuries but the cause of the rockslide is unknown. From this point on the film becomes more focused on its intended subject, the search for Bigfoot. After this incident the team feels they're being watched by 'someone or something' and everyone takes turns guarding the camp at night. One evening a bear attacks while they sleep and everyone is shaken up but none are seriously injured. On a subsequent evening the camp is once again attacked, but this time the lookout was able to scare off the attacker with gunshots.

Multiple sensors begin to light up, the camp is attacked and we hear the same haunting wail as earlier. As the lookouts scramble for a clear shot with their tranquilizer guns, large boulders and branches are thrown in from multiple directions. Paul Markham is injured by one of the rocks and one of the shadowy creatures actually invades the camp and destroys most of the surveillance equipment. The attackers are eventually scared off and when daylight comes the team gets a good look at the devastation. There are many footprints around the camp but no signs of a dead or wounded Sasquatch.

The camera then switches to a first person view, hinting at an unseen presence and the scene culminates with the view of a large human-like creature's reflection at water's edge while a haunting wail echos through the forest. Opening credits are next, followed by a review of recent Bigfoot stories via newspaper clippings and narration. Next up is the well-known Patterson-Gimlin Film, shot by Roger Patterson on October 20, 1967, in Bluff Creek, CA which shows an ape-like creature walking along a dry creek bed. The narrator goes on to explain that by running statistical data through modern computers, a site in British Columbia has been determined as the most likely spot for a population of Sasquatch to live undisturbed. An expedition is mounted, hoping to verify the creature's existence and secure funding for future research into the phenomenon. The seven man team is composed of Native American guide Techka Blackhawk, seasoned wilderness explorer Josh Bigsby, wise-cracking reporter Bob Vernon, anthropologist Dr. Paul Markham, cook Barney Snipe, animal handler Hank Parshall and team leader Chuck Evans who also narrates the film. The team is on horseback and brings tracking dogs to aid in the hunt. As the film progresses, tales of Sasquatch encounters by earlier explorers are interwoven with the current expedition's adventure and told as campfire stories. These scenes are recreated by uncredited cast members and include the Ape Canyon incident in which miners are attacked while sleeping in their cabin and an encounter by early pioneer explorers Bauman and Jessup. Initially the expedition takes on the feel of a nature trek, but as we reach a scene where the team is traversing a hillside it takes on a more ominous feel. As rocks begin tumbling down towards them from above, Techka stops the caravan in time to avoid injuries but the cause of the rockslide is unknown. From this point on the film becomes more focused on its intended subject, the search for Bigfoot.

Unfortunately for Sloane, Caitlin continually seems to find herself involved in press scandals. Sloane is under pressure to make this event perfect so that she is chosen for a promotion to Vice President instead of her ex-boyfriend and co-worker Jason. To help her in her climb to the top, Sloane is dating her boss Andrew, who is also the son of the head of the company. Sloane is so focused on herself and her goals that she often doesn’t consider the feelings of those around her, preferring to think only of herself. She makes plans to work all of Christmas Day rather than spend time with her mother or go to the dinner hosted by her friend from college, Jenny, and Jenny’s husband, Ed. Jenny and Ed opened a restaurant, but are now in financial trouble. After visiting them at their restaurant, Sloane promises to help them out by giving out gift certificates to their restaurant in her company gift baskets. Out a club that night Caitlin chokes to death on the olive from a martini. Her ghost comes back to haunt Sloane, telling her that her time is running out and she needs to change her ways or pay the price. Caitlin tells Sloane that for the next 3 nights she will be visited by 3 different ghosts at the stroke of midnight and they will give her a chance at redemption. Sloane is shocked and confused when Andrew calls her to tell her that Caitlin has died, not believing that she just talked to a ghost. So, she decides to see the body for herself. At the hospital, Sloane runs into Patrick, her ex-boyfriend from college, who is a doctor at the hospital. Upon seeing Caitlin’s body, Sloane is clearly more upset about the implications for the movie premiere than the loss of a young girl. Sloane becomes even more flustered after being visited by Caitlin’s ghost again, and seeks consolation from Patrick. The spark between them is still there, and Patrick confronts Sloane about breaking up with him rather than going with him to medical school in Iowa. The next day, Caitlin’s ghost continues to follow around Sloane, interfering in her every day activities. Andrew puts Sloane in charge of Caitlin’s memorial, and Sloane decides to combine it with the movie premiere. Consequently, everyone at the office has to work overtime, even on Christmas Day. Patrick calls Sloane and asks her out on a date, but she is torn and puts off having to give him an answer. At midnight that night, Sloane is transported back in time and is visited by the spirit of “ex-mas past”, her first boyfriend from high school, Brad. Together Brad and Caitlin show her Christmas when she was younger and how her mom shaped Sloane’s materialistic view on relationships. Brad shows Sloane how throughout her whole life, she has left guys hanging. In particular, Brad shows her when she broke up with Patrick by moving out while he was gone at class, leaving only a note. Sloane then sees that Patrick was planning on proposing to her. They then try to make Sloane see how after Patrick she went through a series of guys, always trying to trade up. Finally, Brad breaks the news to Sloane that Andrew is cheating on her with an unnamed blonde. The next day at work Sloane confronts Andrew about his cheating. Andrew admits to it, but claims that it was only a one-time thing. He wants to continue dating, but Sloane breaks up with him. Afterwards, Sloane is only worried about how it will affect their career, making her competition with Jason for the promotion heat up even more. Sloane decides to use her dinner reservations that she had with Andrew to have dinner with Patrick instead. On the date, as she and Patrick are about to kiss, Andrew comes and proposes to Sloane. Sloane says yes, completely forgetting about Patrick. At midnight that night, Caitlin and the spirit of “ex-mas present”, Jason, show Sloane how her thoughtless actions affect those around her. Sloane observes her secretary Ella telling her son that she won’t be home on Christmas Day, Jenny and Ed talking about how Sloane takes her for granted, and her mom finding out that her husband won’t be home for Christmas and will be spending it completely alone. Last, Sloane discovers that Andrew was actually on the phone while talking to her about their engagement and sees how upset Patrick was. Caitlin’s ghost and Jason’s spirit want to show Sloane that if she continues on acting like she currently is, she is going to end up alone. The next day Sloane attempts to fix the relationships in her life. She admits to Jenny that she forget to put the gift certificates in the gift baskets, making Jenny very upset. Sloane then goes to visit Patrick at the hospital. Patrick is upset and tells Sloane that he doesn’t like who she is becoming, saying that he “could never fall in love with her now”. As she’s leaving the hospital, Sloane is visited by the spirit of “ex-mas future”, who is dressed like Santa Claus. First, he shows Sloane her mother spending Christmas alone, with the 3 dogs and the maid tried to get her to come join her family. She thinks her mother has gone crazy when she named one of the dogs after her. She often refers the other two dogs as her brothers, but she's always seen her as a human being. The spirit disagrees and tells her that she was lonely because Sloane didn't even bother to come visit her when she needed her. After her mother suffers from another failed marriage with her fifth husband leaving her, she falls apart and has to depend on the dogs for support. The Santa spirit then brings Sloane to the future home of Jenny and Ed where they receive a Christmas card from her. She discovers that Jenny’s restaurant failed because of her forgetfulness to put in the gift cards in the basket and it forced her to be a waitress at Applebee's. Sloane tries to tell him that wasn't her fault, but the spirit doesn't believe her. He tells her that she has to accept responsibility for her actions because Jenny depended on her to help save her restaurant and it lead to them not being friends anymore. Outside the hospital, Sloane thinks he brought her there to show her how much Patrick hates her. The spirit tells her that she never sees him again after she embarrasses herself by ignoring Patrick and accepting Andrew's proposal. He also tells Sloane that she doesn't care about love anymore. She tells off the Santa spirit that she's engaged to Andrew and that she cares about love. He would never become her ex because she loves him. He laughs at her naivety and reveals himself as Andrew, her future ex-husband. After recovering from her shock, Sloane confronts him and states they were supposed to be married. Andrew informs her that they do get married, but also they will get a divorce because of their different lifestyles. She wanted power and wealth, while he wanted to make his marriage work. Andrew mentions that even though Sloane will become extremely wealthy from the divorce by taking half of his company and clients from him, she would still lose everything. He shows her the consequences of her actions that brought her when she continued to behave the way she did by pushing everyone else who depended on her out of her life, she'll end up dying in the hospital alone like Jason and Caitlin's spirit predicted. Realizing her mistake, Sloane begs Andrew to help her fix this because this isn't the future she wanted, but he refuses and leaves her. Sloane wakes up on Christmas Day determined to fix her life. First she goes to her mother's house to reconcile with her and drops her off at Jenny’s for Christmas dinner. Sloane proceeds to go to the movie premiere/memorial, where she gives her secretary permission to go home for the day and puts all of the gift certificates in the gift baskets. In the end, the event is a success and Sloane gets the promotion to Vice President. Right after Andrew tells her the good news, she breaks up with him when she realises that he wasn't the man she was looking for and gives back his ring. At this point, Caitlin has achieved her mission so she gets her wings and goes up to Heaven. As Sloane is leaving the party, she and Jason end their competition on friendly terms. Sloane goes to the hospital and apologizes to Patrick. She confesses her love for him and tries to convince him that she is still the same person that she was in college. In the end, he forgives her and they share a romantic kiss. Together they go to Jenny’s house for the Christmas dinner. The movie ends with Sloane making a Merry Christmas toast, surrounded by the people she loves and who love her.

The police arrive at the apartment to discover a woman sprawled on the floor with her throat sliced open and the corpse of her daughter stuffed in the chimney. Detective Emmett Fields is called to assist in the investigation and discovers that the crime resembles a fictional murder in the short story ""The Murders in the Rue Morgue"", which is part of a collection of stories penned by the writer Edgar Allan Poe. Poe has become a social pariah and penniless drunkard whose stories have not been circulated for some time. He has fallen in love with the beautiful young Emily Hamilton and desires to marry her but faces opposition from her father Captain Hamilton, a military man who loathes Poe and goes to the length of threatening physical violence. Poe is brought to see Fields for questioning and is horrified to learn someone is using his stories as the backdrop for a series of murders. Fields then proposes that Poe volunteer his services to help the police catch the killer and the writer agrees to the task. The two men are called to investigate the murder of literary critic Ludwig Griswold, the man who became Poe's rival after a feud that was published in the Baltimore newspapers. Poe realizes the gruesome crime resembles a scene from ""The Pit and the Pendulum"" as Fields notices a red demon mask near the corpse. The two then deduce that the scene of the next crime will take place at Captain Hamilton's annual masquerade ball - a scene that will resemble the Masked Ball in ""The Masque of the Red Death"". Fields assigns several members of the Baltimore Police to go undercover as guests at the Masked Ball. Sometime before midnight, at the height of the festivities, a man on horseback dressed in a skeleton costume appears. Fields shoots the man only to learn he was an actor hired for the entertainment and receives an anonymous note. Poe then realizes Emily has been kidnapped, meaning the event was all a distraction. It's revealed in the killer's note that he will continue to commit murders and leave clues to Emily's location. The killer then threatens to kill Emily if Poe does not start writing columns for the newspaper that describe the brutal combination of fact and fiction - forcing Poe to comply with the request in order to save Emily. The local Medical School's anatomy class discovers a live raven and the corpse of a prostitute in theatrical clothing. Poe and Fields investigate and deduce the scene resembles ""The Mystery of Marie Rogêt"" except for one detail - the blood on the corpse's hands was not an element of Poe's story. The two soon learn the woman was an actress in costume as Lady Macbeth and rush to the theatre where the victim worked, demanding to see all the stage hands. All the stage hands are accounted for except for Maurice, a sailor on leave after his ship landed in Baltimore. Poe and Fields notice a mysterious figure running along the catwalks and pursue him but the figure escapes. Fields later makes an off-handed comment that the name of the ship Maurice arrived on is the Fortunato - which prompts Poe to realize the next murder will resemble ""The Cask of Amontillado"". Poe and Fields search tunnels under the city with several policemen and discover an area with fresh brickwork, an area that might be where Emily is being held. The officers smash through the brick and discover what appears to be a woman with blonde hair in the costume Emily wore the night she was kidnapped. But the body is revealed to be that of the sailor Maurice, who was dressed to resemble Emily after he was killed and buried in the niche. Two clues are found on Maurice: a pocket watch that was stopped at 12:27 and then stuffed into his mouth, and a tattoo on his back that had some flesh carved out of it. Poe and Fields deduce these clues will give the location of Emily, and Poe realizes a church in Baltimore called Holy Cross is where Emily must be. Everyone races to the church but they find it locked. While attempting to break in, one policeman whose name is PC Cantrell shoots at the killer but the latter jumps from the roof and slits PC Cantrell's throat. Poe and Fields hear the shooting and race to catch the killer who shoots Fields and incapacitates him. Poe takes after the killer in a horse race but the killer escapes. Poe walks back to the church where he meets up with Captain Hamilton, who finally apologizes for his treatment of Poe. Fields discovers an empty grave at the church that has Emily's name written on a wooden cross. Poe then decides to write a new column in which he tells the killer that he's tired of this. People in Baltimore, while still enjoying the excitement of the murders, decide to burn down Poe's house because they blame his stories for inspiring this bloodshed. Poe then moves in with Fields because he no longer has lodgings. In the morning, the maid gives Poe both the newspaper and a letter from the killer. Poe deduces that the killer left the note on the doorstep the night before. Then, the paper boy came by and put the newspaper on top of the note after it stopped raining. Poe therefore deduces that the killer is someone who read his new column before it was published. Poe then assumes the killer is the newspaper editor. Fields, meanwhile, is having surgery with no anesthetic to remove a bullet from his shoulder. The doctor uses a magnet to find the bullet in his flesh, an experience Fields later uses to realize that the ink the killer used in all his notes was magnetic. Since this is the type of ink used in newspaper printing, Fields later independently realizes that someone at the paper is the killer. Poe reaches the newspaper office and finds the editor dead, with his hands separated from his arms and his body arranged at his desk as if writing a letter. In front of the editor is a note that reads, ""Getting Warmer!"". Ivan congratulates him on finding him, and the typesetter explains that he missed Poe's writing so much that he decided to make up a story of his own and then act it out in real life so that Poe would have to write about it. Poe pulls out a gun but Ivan reminds him that Emily will die if he pulls the trigger. So Poe hands the gun over to Ivan and tells him that he can kill him if he will release Emily. Ivan gives Poe a vial of poison and tells him to drink it, so that he can keep talking to his ""favorite writer"" while the poison slowly kills him. Once Poe is too weak to go for help, Ivan tells Poe that he's moving to Paris because he wants to do the same to Jules Verne. Poe learns that Ivan will be traveling under the name ""Reynolds"". Before Ivan leaves, he makes a reference to ""The Tell-Tale Heart"" and Poe realizes that Emily is buried under the floor beneath him. He breaks through the floor into the cellar and digs Emily out. The police get there and put Emily in an ambulance. Poe wanders off to a park bench to die. While he's sitting there, a bearded man comes over and says he recognizes him as ""Edgar Poe"" the famous writer. That pleases Poe, but the poison has him so addled, all he can say to the man is ""tell Fields his name is Reynolds"", which the man interprets as nonsense. Later, at the hospital where Poe is pronounced dead, the doctor tells Fields that Poe's last words were unintelligible, that he had ""said that Fields' last name was Reynolds"". Ivan is seen exiting a train station in France, and as he enters a carriage Fields greets him with a pistol. Then, Ivan jumps at Fields and a gunshot is heard."

The doctor uses a magnet to find the bullet in his flesh, an experience Fields later uses to realize that the ink the killer used in all his notes was magnetic. Since this is the type of ink used in newspaper printing, Fields later independently realizes that someone at the paper is the killer. Poe reaches the newspaper office and finds the editor dead, with his hands separated from his arms and his body arranged at his desk as if writing a letter. In front of the editor is a note that reads, ""Getting Warmer!"". Ivan congratulates him on finding him, and the typesetter explains that he missed Poe's writing so much that he decided to make up a story of his own and then act it out in real life so that Poe would have to write about it. Poe pulls out a gun but Ivan reminds him that Emily will die if he pulls the trigger. So Poe hands the gun over to Ivan and tells him that he can kill him if he will release Emily. Ivan gives Poe a vial of poison and tells him to drink it, so that he can keep talking to his ""favorite writer"" while the poison slowly kills him. Once Poe is too weak to go for help, Ivan tells Poe that he's moving to Paris because he wants to do the same to Jules Verne. Poe learns that Ivan will be traveling under the name ""Reynolds"". Before Ivan leaves, he makes a reference to ""The Tell-Tale Heart"" and Poe realizes that Emily is buried under the floor beneath him. He breaks through the floor into the cellar and digs Emily out. The police get there and put Emily in an ambulance. Poe wanders off to a park bench to die. While he's sitting there, a bearded man comes over and says he recognizes him as ""Edgar Poe"" the famous writer. That pleases Poe, but the poison has him so addled, all he can say to the man is ""tell Fields his name is Reynolds"", which the man interprets as nonsense. Later, at the hospital where Poe is pronounced dead, the doctor tells Fields that Poe's last words were unintelligible, that he had ""said that Fields' last name was Reynolds"". Ivan is seen exiting a train station in France, and as he enters a carriage Fields greets him with a pistol. Then, Ivan jumps at Fields and a gunshot is heard."

Sixteen years later, Margaret and Duncan  are moving into a new house as he gets ready for his first day at a new school. However, Duncan fears that his orange skin and appetite for coal will make others think of him as a freak and a prime target for bullies. At school, he quickly develops a crush on its popular girl Jenna  and makes an enemy out of her ex-boyfriend Troy Adams . In biology class, Duncan makes friends with fellow outcasts Kenny and Isabel  who happens to be a Kaiju-obsessed fangirl who develops a crush on Duncan after he shows her a Gomorradon, a small frog-like Kaiju he caught in the process of apparently making a fool of himself. Late that evening, Troy's friends break into Jenna's locker and steal the money she saved for the school's Homecoming. The next day, Duncan meets up with ""Blitz"" Barnes , undercover as the gym teacher, and defends Kenny from Troy and his friends in a game of dodge ball. After a confrontation with Troy, Blitz takes Duncan to Dr. Pytel  at the M.E.G.T.A.F. base upon the discovery of him being able to breath fire. Later back at school, Blitz smooths things over with Principal Dave  to keep Duncan out of trouble. While he and Troy are cleaning up their mess in the cafeteria, Isabel tells Duncan about a party that everybody will be going to, and he agrees to go in hopes of romantically seducing Jenna. At the party, Troy tries to tell Jenna about Duncan until Troy's dad  comes and takes him back home for being grounded. Duncan and Jenna begin to form a friendship but she abruptly leaves after he talks about Troy's dad. Isabel finds him and tells him about Jenna walking off because of the fact that her dad is dead. However things take a turn for the worse as Belloc arrives looking for Duncan. While hiding with Isabel, Duncan reveals to her that Belloc is his father. Belloc finds them and Duncan tells Isabel to run, but before she can escape, Belloc traps her underneath his tail. Duncan demands him to let her go and lures him away, freeing Isabel. Belloc chases Duncan but quickly captures him and takes him away to the Kaiju lair in the desert. Much to Duncan's dismay, he learns that Belloc wants him to become his successor as ""King of the Kaiju"" and rule over the giant dragon-like monsters, though the human world has made him soft when he needs to be remorseless. Then Belloc presents Duncan as his heir to the other Kaiju and throws him into a lava pit, Duncan emerges in his Kaiju form and faints. Waking in the desert, he finds his way to Kenny's trailer. Kenny tells Duncan that Isabel told him about Belloc being his father and asks why he was at the party. Duncan replies that Isabel invited him, causing Kenny to become jealous. Back home with his mother, she assures him that the move and deal with M.E.G.T.A.F. were to let him live a normal life and go to college. Back in school, Duncan is surprised that everyone except Troy now treats him like a celebrity. Isabel reveals that it is because she told them about him saving them from Belloc. Then Duncan sees Jenna head for the locker room and leaves. Meanwhile, Jenna opens her locker to find an envelope with a glowing crystal inside to sell and pay for Homecoming. Later, Isabel attempts to approach Duncan but loses her chance when he and Jenna meet up again. He asks Jenna to be his date for Homecoming, and she agrees. Afterwards, Blitz takes Duncan into the desert to locate the Kaiju lair but they fall under attack. Duncan fights the Kaiju while his father watches, as it is the first of many challenges for the Kaiju throne. Duncan almost kills the Kaiju but refuses to do so. Then Blitz appears with reinforcements and they open fire on Belloc, until he abruptly surrenders. That night, Duncan, Jenna, Kenny, Isabel, and Margeret go to the dance together. As Jenna and Duncan dance together, Isabel watches them despite Kenny's attempts to get her to dance with him. However after Troy and Jenna are elected Homecoming King and Queen and go on stage, Isabel dances with Duncan in a romantic embrace, causing Kenny to break them apart and unleash his jealous fury. In the process, Kenny yells at Duncan that Isabel only likes him because of Belloc being his father. Jenna overhears this and backs away from Duncan into Troy's arms, causing Duncan to storm out. As Isabel reprimands Kenny for what he did, two Kaiju named Abbadon and Astaroth appear. Just as Abbadon and Astaroth start wrecking havoc, putting all the dance participants in danger, Duncan comes to their aid. Changing to his Kaiju form, he leads them into the desert and ultimately defeats them with help from Belloc, Margaret, and Jenna."

Entering the room, Danny finds his friend and roommate Flip ([[Brett_Stewart_ sitting in an easy chair in front of the TV holding a falafel sandwich aloft. Flip fails to respond to Danny's calls and Danny discovers that Flip is dead.   The scene then flashes back in time, nine months prior to Flip's death, to Brisbane, where Danny and Flip are sharing accommodations in a large, old Queenslander with several quirky roommates. The Queenslander is a single-storey house with a steeply pitched roof set about a full storey above the ground on stilts with wooden stairways leading up to the front and back doors. The house, whose walls are made of light wooden slats to prevent the heat from being trapped indoors, is surrounded by broad, screened verandas, except in the back, where the kitchen, dining area, and bathroom are. The rooms on the other three sides all have openings into the house as well as onto the verandas. There is a broad corridor leading straight from the front door to the back door, right through the lounge in the center of the house. Further air circulation is facilitated by large, hinged transoms adjacent to the ceiling in each of the interior walls. In the warm Queensland winter, Taylor , a Russian with military obsessions who is significantly older than his 20-something housemates, is committing random acts of violence, such as teeing off on bullfrogs with golf clubs. Observing Taylor through the slatted windows of the kitchen and dining area, Danny, Flip, Milo , and Otis  are arguing about whether it is realistic for Milo's favourite movie to portray two men in deadly circumstances confessing their love for each other. Flip notes that it's very common for drunken men to say ""I love you, man,"" to each other. Danny strums a guitar and sings ""California Dreamin'"" and Otis unpacks his shopping of multiple boxes of frozen fast foods. Milo gets angry at the others' joking suggestion that the characters in his favourite movie might be homosexual and he takes Taylor's golf club to go out and hit frogs. Danny then tells a horror story about a man who masturbated so much that he fell in love with his own hand. They then start arguing about how many times a man can have an orgasm in his lifetime. Danny, who has broken up with his girlfriend six months prior, then claims he knows a special sexual ""move"" that drives women ""ga-ga."" Taylor, in particular, is extremely skeptical. The conversation comes to a halt when a female roommate, a pretty, bespectacled English girl named Sam , comes in to get a drink from the refrigerator. Danny is then shown visiting a Social Security office, where a young social services officer  scoffs at his claim to being a writer. The welfare officer notes that, even with a college degree, he himself had to work at Burger King for years before getting his current job and says that if the agency finds him a ""job that says you lick toilet bowls, then that's what you do. You lick toilet bowls."" Back at home, Sam, who is studying diligently, also disputes Danny's claim to be a writer and she tries to disabuse Danny of the notion that his ex-girlfriend, who ran off with Danny's best friend, might come back to him. Danny wishes for a roll of teletype paper as a spur to stream-of-consciousness creativity, like it was for his hero Jack Kerouac. Flip then relates a rumour that Penthouse magazine pays $25,000 to publish stories. Danny is in the bath reading Kerouac and smoking when he hears the doorbell and he goes out wet and dressed in only a towel to greet Anya , a mysterious foreigner, who has come to inquire about the availability of a room in the house. Danny introduces Anya to Sam, Otis, Milo, Jabba the Hut , and Derek the Bank Clerk . Jabba, or ""Jabber,"" is a heavyset young man who constantly watches television. Derek the Bank Clerk doesn't have a bedroom of his own and instead saves money by living in a small camping tent in the TV lounge. Anya declares herself a strict vegetarian. Flip points out a rotting beef patty stuck to the ceiling of the kitchen and Taylor enters the house briefly to set fire to the dirty dishes in the sink. Later that night, Milo and Otis set the rules for a contest to see which of them can successfully romance Anya. Danny initially resists, saying that he's ""in it for the long haul,"" but eventually agrees to the terms. Sam declares them all stupid due to the rush of blood away from their brains and towards their genitals.  A pair of thugs  shows up at the house to relay the landlord's complaints about four months' unpaid rent. Sam makes them tea and offers them biscuits. The thugs ascertain that none of the residents has connections to the police or politicians and Danny fails to impress them with his claim of being a writer for Penthouse, especially since he has only an Underwood typewriter rather than a ""PC or a Mac."" The thugs demand the back rent and two months' advance rent by the end of the week. The senior thug reports to the landlord on his mobile phone and Sam warns him about the risk of brain cancer. As he is leaving, the junior thug stabs Milo's basketball with a knife and Milo faints to the floor. Danny takes a shot at writing erotica for Penthouse, but Sam is unimpressed by his repeated use of the word ""entered."" Out on the veranda, Anya is supervising the moving in of her belongings. Danny's further attempts to seek inspiration are interrupted by loud noises from the lounge, where Jabba, Otis, Milo, Flip, Derek, and Taylor are singing along to ""Always on My Mind."" Sam and Anya scoff at the ""bonding ritual."" Danny explains that ""it's a tribal thing."" Sam and Anya exchange a significant glance.  Danny is sitting on the front steps smoking in the full moonlight, while Flip lies on a banana lounge chair on the lawn with a reflective visor, extolling the virtues of ""albino moontanning."" Danny gets metaphysical while Flip expresses his admiration for the ""cashmere sweater babes"" who live across the street. Anya comes out and tells them of a pre-patriarchal pagan sacrificial ritual on the shortest night of the year. Danny concedes that ""men are bastards"" and then Anya reveals that she has heard about Danny's secret sexual ""weapon.""  To the sound of the Tardis in operation and the theme to ""Doctor Who,"" Danny, angry that Anya has been told about his sexual move, rushes inside to confront Milo and Otis, who are getting high with the aid of a bucket bong. Danny retreats to his room to smoke, but Anya finds him there. Danny proposes marriage.  Anya expresses disdain for marriage while looking at the photographs and postcards stuck on the wall above Danny's typewriter. Danny again expresses the regret that teletype paper rolls are not available. Anya reads Danny's palm and delivers an analysis of Danny's character. Anya asks to invite some friends over for a party and then kisses Danny before leaving. The next morning, Danny types out his masturbation horror story and posts it to Penthouse. While checking the mail, he finds an invitation to the wedding of his ex-girlfriend and best friend. Sam is not surprised at the development, but Danny is devastated. Milo charges in with a taped-up basketball, excited that he has won the bet by securing a candle-lit dinner date with Anya, slipping a pair of underpants over Danny's head, as per the terms of the competition. Milo also is enthusiastic about Anya's plans for a party. A young Japanese girl, Satomi , who speaks little English, comes in, declaring, ""I move in now."" Sam tries to tell her that the room has been taken, but when Satomi produces a wad of cash, Sam offers to let her stay in a narrow storage closet in the screened veranda surrounding the house.  Danny, Taylor, Satomi, and Sam are talking in the kitchen as Anya's black-clad party guests walk through to the back yard. Sam is startled by the sound of chanting coming from the party and Danny explains that Anya is recreating a sacrificial ritual. A drunken, painted, and ready-to-party Milo pops in, dressed in a loincloth and a crown of thorns. A hooded Anya drags him outside on a leash. Anya persuades Sam to join in the ritual. Danny demurs, ""just in case the Christian brothers were right,"" but encourages Sam to go ahead. Outside, Milo has been tied to the pole of the clothes drying rack and starts to become alarmed at his situation.  As Milo's alarm increases, Danny witnesses the arrival of a gang of skinheads that Taylor has invited to help confront the landlord's thugs. Taylor himself is armed only with a squirt gun and he hands Danny a water pistol as well. In the front yard, Flip is dismayed to see a cashmere sweater girl  arrive home from a date and loudly have sex with a ""rugby dude""  on her front lawn. Flip goes inside and lies down in the corridor in a state of shock. Milo escapes from the neopagans as the skinheads wander around, looking for trouble. To Jabba's horror, the skinheads take the television and start vandalizing the house. A skinhead on the roof starts up a chainsaw. At the ritual in the back yard, Anya kisses Sam just as the skinheads manage to remove the entire back wall of the house, exposing the rooms inside. The beef patty drops from the ceiling as the landlord's thugs arrive, and Danny and Satomi  quickly pack their belongings and leave. Danny leaves his boom box with Flip and the two exchange declarations of ""I love you, man,"" as the skinheads start riding their motorcycles through the crumbling house, leaping over Flip, who still lies prone in the central corridor. The thugs report the bad news to their employer, this time wearing headsets instead of holding their phones up to their ears.   Danny has moved to a shared flat in Melbourne. Danny plays ""California Dreamin'"" on a rainy day while Iain the Socialist  puts away the shopping while complaining about capitalist conspiracies and warning Danny about using the microwave.  Danny attends the outdoor wedding of his ex-girlfriend  and best friend  on a rainy day, getting soaked to skin in his tuxedo. At home, he lies submerged in the bath, still wearing his tux, when the doorbell rings. A soaked Taylor and Flip have come south from Queensland on Taylor's motorcycle. Taylor tells Danny he should call his mother and complains about his lack of sex while Iain reads from a book about Lenin. Taylor expresses his pleasure at having discovered the joys of hiring prostitutes, gleefully explaining the cost savings compared to dating. Danny goes to his room to write, but the bell rings again. This time it's a soaked Sam, who is fleeing from an argument with Anya. Taylor checks the telephone directory for local prostitutes. Sam lies in bed with Danny and asks him to make love. Danny declines on the grounds that ""we're mates.""  Danny, still in his tuxedo, is awakened in the middle of the night by loud music by Nick Cave. He tracks the sound to the bathroom, and water is flooding out from under the door. Danny breaks down the door and drags Sam, who has cut her wrists, out of the bath. Sam complains that she ""can't even kill myself properly."" Sam and Danny kiss. In the morning, Danny -- still wearing most of his tuxedo -- is awakened when two policemen burst into Danny's bedroom. The lead cop  lectures Danny about morality while the other one notices that Danny's typewriter is loaded with a roll of toilet paper. The policemen line up Danny, Sam, Flip, and Iain in the lounge to interrogate them with Taylor lying unconscious at their feet. The cops threaten to violate their civil liberties, to ""torch"" the apartment, but do not specify as to why they are there. The younger cop, Russ ([[Robert Morgan , draws a gun when Iain the Socialist makes a sarcastic remark, but the older cop tells him to put it away. Russ then starts checking all their arms for heroin needle track marks and declares Flip a ""pincushion."" Danny is surprised and asks Flip what's going on, but Flip says it's alright because his nana is sending him to a rehab bootcamp. The cops finally reveal that say they're there because of a night of drunken mayhem enacted by Taylor at a casino and brothel, aided by Danny's credit card. The cops have found out that Danny owes more than $7,000 to the Brisbane landlord in addition to $8,000 in expenses and damages incurred by Taylor during his rampage. Iain demands a lawyer and Russ draws his gun again. Iain urinates in his pants and then grabs for the gun, which goes off. In the morning, Iain, who is alive and conscious with only an ear injury, is taken away in an ambulance. The older cop tells Danny that they will report that Iain was armed. The cop warns Danny to be careful and Danny takes it as a threat and Sam encourages him to leave town. She, however, says she will stay. Taylor, unaware of the recent events, finally awakes from his sleep and stretches loudly on the lawn, declaring that he had ""the best fucking night I've had in ages.""   Three months later, Danny is living in a very tidy flat in Sydney that is owned by Nina , a high-maintenance aspiring actor. Equally finicky Dirk  is arguing with Nina over which kitchen shelf a can of pineapple chunks should be kept on. Danny is playing ""California Dreamin'"" on the guitar as Nina and Dirk's argument escalates. Danny notices a newspaper article saying that Melbourne police have been cleared of responsibility for a shooting, presumably the one in which Iain the Socialist was injured. Dirk demands a house meeting. The doorbell buzzes and Sam, who has bleached her hair and ditched her eyeglasses, arrives, telling Danny he should call his mother. At a meeting of all the roommates, Nina explains the complicated house rules to Sam. When Sam notes that everyone except Nina has household duties, Nina goes off at her and leaves, her parting shot being that she doesn't understand why Danny would find her attractive.  The doorbell buzzes and an agent ([[Clayton Jacobson  from a department store credit bureau is looking for a ""Mr. Corcoran."" Danny shows the man a drawer full of collection letters for the non-existent Robert J. Corcoran. Nina distributes copies of detailed instructions to everyone regarding what people should say if anyone calls for her while she's out. The roommates offer the credit agent tea. Danny sits in front of his typewriter as the door buzzes. Anya is at the front door and she tells Danny to call his mother. A policewoman, Sgt. P. O'Neill , comes looking for Corcoran. O'Neill is shown the same drawer full of correspondence for him. Anya and Sam argue while Nina complains that nobody cares about her problems. Danny  gives O'Neill tea and biscuits. Nina complains that ""bulimia is not cheap."" On her way out, O'Neill tells Danny he'll never be a successful writer with downbeat titles like ""Crime and Punishment."" Soon, Anya and Sam are making out and having loud sex and Nina -- leaving for her trip -- tells Danny to get rid of them. Danny is sitting alone in Nina's stark white bedroom when Anya comes in, disheveled from her lovemaking with Sam. She takes a cigarette and asks if they are being too loud. Anya goes back to Sam to resume their loud lovemaking. Danny starts to color some of his greying hair with Nina's cosmetics when Anya comes back in to apologize for breaking a lamp. Danny says he just wants to be left alone and Anya begins kissing him passionately. Sam appears at the door and sees them. Back in Danny's bedroom, Sam is angrily and hurriedly packing her things while Danny apologizes. Sam declares Anya a ""chaos freak."" Anya calmly smokes on the bed and compares herself and Sam to Cardassians and Bajorans from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. Sam tells Danny to go ahead and sleep with Anya and heads out the door. When Danny asks where she's going, Sam demands to know what happened to his ""moral code of mateship."" Sam makes a dire prediction about Danny's future and leaves.  Dirk gets busy scrubbing the bathroom shower stall with a toothbrush and begins weeping. In the lounge, Nina is angry at everyone for giving everyone the wrong messages while she was away. The roommates watch a soap opera while ""Uptight""  comments on how ""very fit"" the actors are. Nina complains that she -- having been to drama school and being a ""bit of a babe"" -- can't get an acting job when there are so many ""fat, ugly whores"" on TV. Anya complains about Sam. Dirk comes in to declare that he's gay but is disappointed by the lack of reaction from the roommates. Dirk then says he has a problem with everyone's ""accepting my homosexuality without question."" He gets even more angry when Danny tells him to finish cleaning the bathroom: ""Gay men are dying, Danny, and you want me to clean the bath."" Danny tries to explain to Dirk that he has his own problems and loses his temper and declares his life a ""psycho fucking nightmare from hell,"" urging Dirk to chill out. Nina again complains that no one asks about her problems: Both her parents have subpoenaed her to testify in their divorce case. But this time she gets some sympathy, from Anya. Danny goes to the kitchen to tell Taylor that Dirk's gay, but, like the others, Taylor had already assumed that. Taylor has been baking and offers Danny some scones, made using a new recipe Taylor is trying. Danny goes to lie on the floor of his bedroom with his telephone sitting on his chest. Taylor, concerned about his ""little buddy,"" slides ""provisions"" under the door -- several packets of baked goods that he has flattened so they fit through the narrow crack. Several hours later, Anya slides a cigarette through, and, sitting on the other side of the door, tells Danny a story about lovers. Danny takes the cigarette. Nina angrily vacates the bathroom for Taylor, who sits on the pot without closing the door. He reaches for a magazine to read and discovers that Penthouse has published Danny's story. As Taylor gives Danny the good news, the doorbell buzzes and on the doorstep is Flip, who has fled from rehab because the bootcamp was too harsh. Sgt. O'Neill charges by Flip, bringing along a partner  and a copy of Crime and Punishment. She has been studying ""pop culture"" and is beginning to catch on to the references in Robert J. Corcoran's credit bills. She adds up the amount due as $28,000 and issues a summons to Danny to appear in court as Nina rushes around tearing down Dirk's homoerotic posters. At night, Danny tells Flip that he's going to be ""sent away"" to prison for credit fraud, but Flip says he needs Danny because he's the only one he knows who is ""not into it."" Having quit heroin, Flip is starting to get in touch with his emotions and appreciates Danny's reliable friendship. Flip confesses that his medication is causing erectile dysfunction and Flip and Danny again exchange statements of ""I love you, man."" Flip leaves Danny's room to get something to eat. Danny sits in his room staring at his typewriter and then starts packing his things in a plastic milk crate. He is disturbed by the sound of loud music and rushes out to yell at Flip to turn the television down. This is the event shown in the prologue, in which Danny discovers that Flip is dead in front of the TV. A pair of cops declares Flip a ""typical bloody junkie"" and covers him with a sheet, telling Danny not to touch anything. Danny looks at the sheet-covered Flip, surrounded by police tape and then heads out the door with his typewriter. Danny boards a ferry and later drops his typewriter from a pier into Sydney harbour. In the morning, Danny is sleeping on the landing of an apartment building. Sam comes out the door and steps over Danny's prone form. As she starts down the stairs, she looks back and recognizes Danny. Danny tells her that Flip has died. Taylor, Milo, Otis, Danny, Jabba, Dirk, Sam, Anya, Nina, and other former roommates gather to dispose of Flip's remains. Each leaves a memento or sacrifice on a charcoal fire in a kettle grill in which Flip's ashes have been dumped. Anya gives Danny a cheque from Penthouse and Nina declares that she and Anya, apparently now a couple, are going to Paris together, where Nina hopes to be more successful as an actor. Danny asks to borrow Sam's telephone and he calls Sgt. O'Neill to tell her about the sad fate of Robert J. Corcoran, apparently to be identified as the now-dead Flip. Danny sits on the steps playing ""California Dreamin'"" and Sam presents him a roll of teletype paper. Sam and Danny set off down the street and Danny proposes marriage, but Sam says she has to ""go out later."" Danny confesses to Sam that he was exaggerating about his special sexual weapon and they go off together as the rest of the roommates head back inside."
29685718	/m/0fq1z_t	I Am Alive: Surviving the Andes Plane Crash	2010		100	{}	{}	"{""/m/0jtdp"": ""Documentary""}"	" The film begins with a pre-credits prologue in which Danny , the protagonist and narrator, enters the lounge of the flat he's staying in to ask that the television volume be reduced. Entering the room, Danny finds his friend and roommate Flip ([[Brett_Stewart_ sitting in an easy chair in front of the TV holding a falafel sandwich aloft. Flip fails to respond to Danny's calls and Danny discovers that Flip is dead.   The scene then flashes back in time, nine months prior to Flip's death, to Brisbane, where Danny and Flip are sharing accommodations in a large, old Queenslander with several quirky roommates. The Queenslander is a single-storey house with a steeply pitched roof set about a full storey above the ground on stilts with wooden stairways leading up to the front and back doors. The house, whose walls are made of light wooden slats to prevent the heat from being trapped indoors, is surrounded by broad, screened verandas, except in the back, where the kitchen, dining area, and bathroom are. The rooms on the other three sides all have openings into the house as well as onto the verandas. There is a broad corridor leading straight from the front door to the back door, right through the lounge in the center of the house. Further air circulation is facilitated by large, hinged transoms adjacent to the ceiling in each of the interior walls. In the warm Queensland winter, Taylor , a Russian with military obsessions who is significantly older than his 20-something housemates, is committing random acts of violence, such as teeing off on bullfrogs with golf clubs. Observing Taylor through the slatted windows of the kitchen and dining area, Danny, Flip, Milo , and Otis  are arguing about whether it is realistic for Milo's favourite movie to portray two men in deadly circumstances confessing their love for each other. Flip notes that it's very common for drunken men to say ""I love you, man,"" to each other. Danny strums a guitar and sings ""California Dreamin'"" and Otis unpacks his shopping of multiple boxes of frozen fast foods. Milo gets angry at the others' joking suggestion that the characters in his favourite movie might be homosexual and he takes Taylor's golf club to go out and hit frogs. Danny then tells a horror story about a man who masturbated so much that he fell in love with his own hand. They then start arguing about how many times a man can have an orgasm in his lifetime. Danny, who has broken up with his girlfriend six months prior, then claims he knows a special sexual ""move"" that drives women ""ga-ga."" Taylor, in particular, is extremely skeptical. The conversation comes to a halt when a female roommate, a pretty, bespectacled English girl named Sam , comes in to get a drink from the refrigerator. Danny is then shown visiting a Social Security office, where a young social services officer  scoffs at his claim to being a writer. The welfare officer notes that, even with a college degree, he himself had to work at Burger King for years before getting his current job and says that if the agency finds him a ""job that says you lick toilet bowls, then that's what you do. You lick toilet bowls."" Back at home, Sam, who is studying diligently, also disputes Danny's claim to be a writer and she tries to disabuse Danny of the notion that his ex-girlfriend, who ran off with Danny's best friend, might come back to him. Danny wishes for a roll of teletype paper as a spur to stream-of-consciousness creativity, like it was for his hero Jack Kerouac. Flip then relates a rumour that Penthouse magazine pays $25,000 to publish stories. Danny is in the bath reading Kerouac and smoking when he hears the doorbell and he goes out wet and dressed in only a towel to greet Anya , a mysterious foreigner, who has come to inquire about the availability of a room in the house. Danny introduces Anya to Sam, Otis, Milo, Jabba the Hut , and Derek the Bank Clerk . Jabba, or ""Jabber,"" is a heavyset young man who constantly watches television. Derek the Bank Clerk doesn't have a bedroom of his own and instead saves money by living in a small camping tent in the TV lounge. Anya declares herself a strict vegetarian. Flip points out a rotting beef patty stuck to the ceiling of the kitchen and Taylor enters the house briefly to set fire to the dirty dishes in the sink. Later that night, Milo and Otis set the rules for a contest to see which of them can successfully romance Anya. Danny initially resists, saying that he's ""in it for the long haul,"" but eventually agrees to the terms. Sam declares them all stupid due to the rush of blood away from their brains and towards their genitals.

Flip confesses that his medication is causing erectile dysfunction and Flip and Danny again exchange statements of ""I love you, man."" Flip leaves Danny's room to get something to eat. Danny sits in his room staring at his typewriter and then starts packing his things in a plastic milk crate. He is disturbed by the sound of loud music and rushes out to yell at Flip to turn the television down. This is the event shown in the prologue, in which Danny discovers that Flip is dead in front of the TV. A pair of cops declares Flip a ""typical bloody junkie"" and covers him with a sheet, telling Danny not to touch anything. Danny looks at the sheet-covered Flip, surrounded by police tape and then heads out the door with his typewriter. Danny boards a ferry and later drops his typewriter from a pier into Sydney harbour. In the morning, Danny is sleeping on the landing of an apartment building. Sam comes out the door and steps over Danny's prone form. As she starts down the stairs, she looks back and recognizes Danny. Danny tells her that Flip has died. Taylor, Milo, Otis, Danny, Jabba, Dirk, Sam, Anya, Nina, and other former roommates gather to dispose of Flip's remains. Each leaves a memento or sacrifice on a charcoal fire in a kettle grill in which Flip's ashes have been dumped. Anya gives Danny a cheque from Penthouse and Nina declares that she and Anya, apparently now a couple, are going to Paris together, where Nina hopes to be more successful as an actor. Danny asks to borrow Sam's telephone and he calls Sgt. O'Neill to tell her about the sad fate of Robert J. Corcoran, apparently to be identified as the now-dead Flip. Danny sits on the steps playing ""California Dreamin'"" and Sam presents him a roll of teletype paper. Sam and Danny set off down the street and Danny proposes marriage, but Sam says she has to ""go out later."" Danny confesses to Sam that he was exaggerating about his special sexual weapon and they go off together as the rest of the roommates head back inside."
29686616	/m/0bbbpgl	The Mysterious Monsters	1976		86	{}	"{""/m/09c7w0"": ""United States of America""}"	"{""/m/0hj3n07"": ""Culture & Society"", ""/m/0jtdp"": ""Documentary""}"	" The film begins with a pre-credits prologue in which Danny , the protagonist and narrator, enters the lounge of the flat he's staying in to ask that the television volume be reduced. Entering the room, Danny finds his friend and roommate Flip ([[Brett_Stewart_ sitting in an easy chair in front of the TV holding a falafel sandwich aloft. Flip fails to respond to Danny's calls and Danny discovers that Flip is dead.   The scene then flashes back in time, nine months prior to Flip's death, to Brisbane, where Danny and Flip are sharing accommodations in a large, old Queenslander with several quirky roommates. The Queenslander is a single-storey house with a steeply pitched roof set about a full storey above the ground on stilts with wooden stairways leading up to the front and back doors. The house, whose walls are made of light wooden slats to prevent the heat from being trapped indoors, is surrounded by broad, screened verandas, except in the back, where the kitchen, dining area, and bathroom are. The rooms on the other three sides all have openings into the house as well as onto the verandas. There is a broad corridor leading straight from the front door to the back door, right through the lounge in the center of the house. Further air circulation is facilitated by large, hinged transoms adjacent to the ceiling in each of the interior walls. In the warm Queensland winter, Taylor , a Russian with military obsessions who is significantly older than his 20-something housemates, is committing random acts of violence, such as teeing off on bullfrogs with golf clubs. Observing Taylor through the slatted windows of the kitchen and dining area, Danny, Flip, Milo , and Otis  are arguing about whether it is realistic for Milo's favourite movie to portray two men in deadly circumstances confessing their love for each other. Flip notes that it's very common for drunken men to say ""I love you, man,"" to each other. Danny strums a guitar and sings ""California Dreamin'"" and Otis unpacks his shopping of multiple boxes of frozen fast foods. Milo gets angry at the others' joking suggestion that the characters in his favourite movie might be homosexual and he takes Taylor's golf club to go out and hit frogs. Danny then tells a horror story about a man who masturbated so much that he fell in love with his own hand. They then start arguing about how many times a man can have an orgasm in his lifetime. Danny, who has broken up with his girlfriend six months prior, then claims he knows a special sexual ""move"" that drives women ""ga-ga."" Taylor, in particular, is extremely skeptical. The conversation comes to a halt when a female roommate, a pretty, bespectacled English girl named Sam , comes in to get a drink from the refrigerator. Danny is then shown visiting a Social Security office, where a young social services officer  scoffs at his claim to being a writer. The welfare officer notes that, even with a college degree, he himself had to work at Burger King for years before getting his current job and says that if the agency finds him a ""job that says you lick toilet bowls, then that's what you do. You lick toilet bowls."" Back at home, Sam, who is studying diligently, also disputes Danny's claim to be a writer and she tries to disabuse Danny of the notion that his ex-girlfriend, who ran off with Danny's best friend, might come back to him. Danny wishes for a roll of teletype paper as a spur to stream-of-consciousness creativity, like it was for his hero Jack Kerouac. Flip then relates a rumour that Penthouse magazine pays $25,000 to publish stories. Danny is in the bath reading Kerouac and smoking when he hears the doorbell and he goes out wet and dressed in only a towel to greet Anya , a mysterious foreigner, who has come to inquire about the availability of a room in the house. Danny introduces Anya to Sam, Otis, Milo, Jabba the Hut , and Derek the Bank Clerk . Jabba, or ""Jabber,"" is a heavyset young man who constantly watches television. Derek the Bank Clerk doesn't have a bedroom of his own and instead saves money by living in a small camping tent in the TV lounge. Anya declares herself a strict vegetarian. Flip points out a rotting beef patty stuck to the ceiling of the kitchen and Taylor enters the house briefly to set fire to the dirty dishes in the sink. Later that night, Milo and Otis set the rules for a contest to see which of them can successfully romance Anya. Danny initially resists, saying that he's ""in it for the long haul,"" but eventually agrees to the terms. Sam declares them all stupid due to the rush of blood away from their brains and towards their genitals.  A pair of thugs  shows up at the house to relay the landlord's complaints about four months' unpaid rent. Sam makes them tea and offers them biscuits. The thugs ascertain that none of the residents has connections to the police or politicians and Danny fails to impress them with his claim of being a writer for Penthouse, especially since he has only an Underwood typewriter rather than a ""PC or a Mac."" The thugs demand the back rent and two months' advance rent by the end of the week. The senior thug reports to the landlord on his mobile phone and Sam warns him about the risk of brain cancer. As he is leaving, the junior thug stabs Milo's basketball with a knife and Milo faints to the floor. Danny takes a shot at writing erotica for Penthouse, but Sam is unimpressed by his repeated use of the word ""entered."" Out on the veranda, Anya is supervising the moving in of her belongings. Danny's further attempts to seek inspiration are interrupted by loud noises from the lounge, where Jabba, Otis, Milo, Flip, Derek, and Taylor are singing along to ""Always on My Mind."" Sam and Anya scoff at the ""bonding ritual."" Danny explains that ""it's a tribal thing."" Sam and Anya exchange a significant glance.  Danny is sitting on the front steps smoking in the full moonlight, while Flip lies on a banana lounge chair on the lawn with a reflective visor, extolling the virtues of ""albino moontanning."" Danny gets metaphysical while Flip expresses his admiration for the ""cashmere sweater babes"" who live across the street. Anya comes out and tells them of a pre-patriarchal pagan sacrificial ritual on the shortest night of the year. Danny concedes that ""men are bastards"" and then Anya reveals that she has heard about Danny's secret sexual ""weapon.""  To the sound of the Tardis in operation and the theme to ""Doctor Who,"" Danny, angry that Anya has been told about his sexual move, rushes inside to confront Milo and Otis, who are getting high with the aid of a bucket bong. Danny retreats to his room to smoke, but Anya finds him there. Danny proposes marriage.  Anya expresses disdain for marriage while looking at the photographs and postcards stuck on the wall above Danny's typewriter. Danny again expresses the regret that teletype paper rolls are not available. Anya reads Danny's palm and delivers an analysis of Danny's character. Anya asks to invite some friends over for a party and then kisses Danny before leaving. The next morning, Danny types out his masturbation horror story and posts it to Penthouse. While checking the mail, he finds an invitation to the wedding of his ex-girlfriend and best friend. Sam is not surprised at the development, but Danny is devastated. Milo charges in with a taped-up basketball, excited that he has won the bet by securing a candle-lit dinner date with Anya, slipping a pair of underpants over Danny's head, as per the terms of the competition. Milo also is enthusiastic about Anya's plans for a party. A young Japanese girl, Satomi , who speaks little English, comes in, declaring, ""I move in now."" Sam tries to tell her that the room has been taken, but when Satomi produces a wad of cash, Sam offers to let her stay in a narrow storage closet in the screened veranda surrounding the house.  Danny, Taylor, Satomi, and Sam are talking in the kitchen as Anya's black-clad party guests walk through to the back yard. Sam is startled by the sound of chanting coming from the party and Danny explains that Anya is recreating a sacrificial ritual. A drunken, painted, and ready-to-party Milo pops in, dressed in a loincloth and a crown of thorns. A hooded Anya drags him outside on a leash. Anya persuades Sam to join in the ritual. Danny demurs, ""just in case the Christian brothers were right,"" but encourages Sam to go ahead. Outside, Milo has been tied to the pole of the clothes drying rack and starts to become alarmed at his situation.  As Milo's alarm increases, Danny witnesses the arrival of a gang of skinheads that Taylor has invited to help confront the landlord's thugs. Taylor himself is armed only with a squirt gun and he hands Danny a water pistol as well. In the front yard, Flip is dismayed to see a cashmere sweater girl  arrive home from a date and loudly have sex with a ""rugby dude""  on her front lawn. Flip goes inside and lies down in the corridor in a state of shock. Milo escapes from the neopagans as the skinheads wander around, looking for trouble. To Jabba's horror, the skinheads take the television and start vandalizing the house. A skinhead on the roof starts up a chainsaw. At the ritual in the back yard, Anya kisses Sam just as the skinheads manage to remove the entire back wall of the house, exposing the rooms inside. The beef patty drops from the ceiling as the landlord's thugs arrive, and Danny and Satomi  quickly pack their belongings and leave. Danny leaves his boom box with Flip and the two exchange declarations of ""I love you, man,"" as the skinheads start riding their motorcycles through the crumbling house, leaping over Flip, who still lies prone in the central corridor. The thugs report the bad news to their employer, this time wearing headsets instead of holding their phones up to their ears.   Danny has moved to a shared flat in Melbourne. Danny plays ""California Dreamin'"" on a rainy day while Iain the Socialist  puts away the shopping while complaining about capitalist conspiracies and warning Danny about using the microwave.  Danny attends the outdoor wedding of his ex-girlfriend  and best friend  on a rainy day, getting soaked to skin in his tuxedo. At home, he lies submerged in the bath, still wearing his tux, when the doorbell rings. A soaked Taylor and Flip have come south from Queensland on Taylor's motorcycle. Taylor tells Danny he should call his mother and complains about his lack of sex while Iain reads from a book about Lenin. Taylor expresses his pleasure at having discovered the joys of hiring prostitutes, gleefully explaining the cost savings compared to dating. Danny goes to his room to write, but the bell rings again. This time it's a soaked Sam, who is fleeing from an argument with Anya. Taylor checks the telephone directory for local prostitutes. Sam lies in bed with Danny and asks him to make love. Danny declines on the grounds that ""we're mates.""  Danny, still in his tuxedo, is awakened in the middle of the night by loud music by Nick Cave. He tracks the sound to the bathroom, and water is flooding out from under the door. Danny breaks down the door and drags Sam, who has cut her wrists, out of the bath. Sam complains that she ""can't even kill myself properly."" Sam and Danny kiss. In the morning, Danny -- still wearing most of his tuxedo -- is awakened when two policemen burst into Danny's bedroom. The lead cop  lectures Danny about morality while the other one notices that Danny's typewriter is loaded with a roll of toilet paper. The policemen line up Danny, Sam, Flip, and Iain in the lounge to interrogate them with Taylor lying unconscious at their feet. The cops threaten to violate their civil liberties, to ""torch"" the apartment, but do not specify as to why they are there. The younger cop, Russ ([[Robert Morgan , draws a gun when Iain the Socialist makes a sarcastic remark, but the older cop tells him to put it away. Russ then starts checking all their arms for heroin needle track marks and declares Flip a ""pincushion."" Danny is surprised and asks Flip what's going on, but Flip says it's alright because his nana is sending him to a rehab bootcamp. The cops finally reveal that say they're there because of a night of drunken mayhem enacted by Taylor at a casino and brothel, aided by Danny's credit card. The cops have found out that Danny owes more than $7,000 to the Brisbane landlord in addition to $8,000 in expenses and damages incurred by Taylor during his rampage. Iain demands a lawyer and Russ draws his gun again. Iain urinates in his pants and then grabs for the gun, which goes off. In the morning, Iain, who is alive and conscious with only an ear injury, is taken away in an ambulance. The older cop tells Danny that they will report that Iain was armed. The cop warns Danny to be careful and Danny takes it as a threat and Sam encourages him to leave town. She, however, says she will stay. Taylor, unaware of the recent events, finally awakes from his sleep and stretches loudly on the lawn, declaring that he had ""the best fucking night I've had in ages.""   Three months later, Danny is living in a very tidy flat in Sydney that is owned by Nina , a high-maintenance aspiring actor. Equally finicky Dirk  is arguing with Nina over which kitchen shelf a can of pineapple chunks should be kept on. Danny is playing ""California Dreamin'"" on the guitar as Nina and Dirk's argument escalates. Danny notices a newspaper article saying that Melbourne police have been cleared of responsibility for a shooting, presumably the one in which Iain the Socialist was injured. Dirk demands a house meeting. The doorbell buzzes and Sam, who has bleached her hair and ditched her eyeglasses, arrives, telling Danny he should call his mother. At a meeting of all the roommates, Nina explains the complicated house rules to Sam. When Sam notes that everyone except Nina has household duties, Nina goes off at her and leaves, her parting shot being that she doesn't understand why Danny would find her attractive.  The doorbell buzzes and an agent ([[Clayton Jacobson  from a department store credit bureau is looking for a ""Mr. Corcoran."" Danny shows the man a drawer full of collection letters for the non-existent Robert J. Corcoran. Nina distributes copies of detailed instructions to everyone regarding what people should say if anyone calls for her while she's out. The roommates offer the credit agent tea. Danny sits in front of his typewriter as the door buzzes. Anya is at the front door and she tells Danny to call his mother. A policewoman, Sgt. P. O'Neill , comes looking for Corcoran. O'Neill is shown the same drawer full of correspondence for him. Anya and Sam argue while Nina complains that nobody cares about her problems. Danny  gives O'Neill tea and biscuits. Nina complains that ""bulimia is not cheap."" On her way out, O'Neill tells Danny he'll never be a successful writer with downbeat titles like ""Crime and Punishment."" Soon, Anya and Sam are making out and having loud sex and Nina -- leaving for her trip -- tells Danny to get rid of them. Danny is sitting alone in Nina's stark white bedroom when Anya comes in, disheveled from her lovemaking with Sam. She takes a cigarette and asks if they are being too loud. Anya goes back to Sam to resume their loud lovemaking. Danny starts to color some of his greying hair with Nina's cosmetics when Anya comes back in to apologize for breaking a lamp. Danny says he just wants to be left alone and Anya begins kissing him passionately. Sam appears at the door and sees them. Back in Danny's bedroom, Sam is angrily and hurriedly packing her things while Danny apologizes. Sam declares Anya a ""chaos freak."" Anya calmly smokes on the bed and compares herself and Sam to Cardassians and Bajorans from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. Sam tells Danny to go ahead and sleep with Anya and heads out the door. When Danny asks where she's going, Sam demands to know what happened to his ""moral code of mateship."" Sam makes a dire prediction about Danny's future and leaves.  Dirk gets busy scrubbing the bathroom shower stall with a toothbrush and begins weeping. In the lounge, Nina is angry at everyone for giving everyone the wrong messages while she was away. The roommates watch a soap opera while ""Uptight""  comments on how ""very fit"" the actors are. Nina complains that she -- having been to drama school and being a ""bit of a babe"" -- can't get an acting job when there are so many ""fat, ugly whores"" on TV. Anya complains about Sam. Dirk comes in to declare that he's gay but is disappointed by the lack of reaction from the roommates. Dirk then says he has a problem with everyone's ""accepting my homosexuality without question."" He gets even more angry when Danny tells him to finish cleaning the bathroom: ""Gay men are dying, Danny, and you want me to clean the bath."" Danny tries to explain to Dirk that he has his own problems and loses his temper and declares his life a ""psycho fucking nightmare from hell,"" urging Dirk to chill out. Nina again complains that no one asks about her problems: Both her parents have subpoenaed her to testify in their divorce case. But this time she gets some sympathy, from Anya. Danny goes to the kitchen to tell Taylor that Dirk's gay, but, like the others, Taylor had already assumed that. Taylor has been baking and offers Danny some scones, made using a new recipe Taylor is trying. Danny goes to lie on the floor of his bedroom with his telephone sitting on his chest. Taylor, concerned about his ""little buddy,"" slides ""provisions"" under the door -- several packets of baked goods that he has flattened so they fit through the narrow crack. Several hours later, Anya slides a cigarette through, and, sitting on the other side of the door, tells Danny a story about lovers. Danny takes the cigarette. Nina angrily vacates the bathroom for Taylor, who sits on the pot without closing the door. He reaches for a magazine to read and discovers that Penthouse has published Danny's story. As Taylor gives Danny the good news, the doorbell buzzes and on the doorstep is Flip, who has fled from rehab because the bootcamp was too harsh. Sgt. O'Neill charges by Flip, bringing along a partner  and a copy of Crime and Punishment. She has been studying ""pop culture"" and is beginning to catch on to the references in Robert J. Corcoran's credit bills. She adds up the amount due as $28,000 and issues a summons to Danny to appear in court as Nina rushes around tearing down Dirk's homoerotic posters. At night, Danny tells Flip that he's going to be ""sent away"" to prison for credit fraud, but Flip says he needs Danny because he's the only one he knows who is ""not into it."" Having quit heroin, Flip is starting to get in touch with his emotions and appreciates Danny's reliable friendship. Flip confesses that his medication is causing erectile dysfunction and Flip and Danny again exchange statements of ""I love you, man."" Flip leaves Danny's room to get something to eat. Danny sits in his room staring at his typewriter and then starts packing his things in a plastic milk crate. He is disturbed by the sound of loud music and rushes out to yell at Flip to turn the television down. This is the event shown in the prologue, in which Danny discovers that Flip is dead in front of the TV.

Anya gives Danny a cheque from Penthouse and Nina declares that she and Anya, apparently now a couple, are going to Paris together, where Nina hopes to be more successful as an actor. Danny asks to borrow Sam's telephone and he calls Sgt. O'Neill to tell her about the sad fate of Robert J. Corcoran, apparently to be identified as the now-dead Flip. Danny sits on the steps playing ""California Dreamin'"" and Sam presents him a roll of teletype paper. Sam and Danny set off down the street and Danny proposes marriage, but Sam says she has to ""go out later."" Danny confesses to Sam that he was exaggerating about his special sexual weapon and they go off together as the rest of the roommates head back inside."

29687650	/m/0fp_7qx	Parallel Trips			120	{}	{}	"{""/m/0jtdp"": ""Documentary""}"	"Venkat Ramakrishnan ([[Srikanth , Sevarkodi Senthil  and Panchavan Parivendan ([[Vijay  are three engineering students who share a room in the hostel of Ideal Engineering College , Chennai. Venkat, who hails from a middle class family, wants to be a wildlife photographer, but is studying engineering because his father wants him to be an engineer. Senthil, hailing from a poor family, is studying engineering to raise his family's fortunes and get them out of poverty. On the other hand, Pari is studying engineering for his simple passion in machines and devices. Pari believes that success in studying is not achieved by solely memorizing definitions given by textbooks or professors, but by understanding and applying the concepts. He believes that one should follow excellence, not success, as success will come itself if excellence is followed. However, this different approach is sneered upon by the faculties, including the dean of the college, Professor Virumandi ""Virus"" Santhanam . Virus and the faculty favour Pari's classmate Srivatsan , also known as ""Silencer"", who is the complete opposite of Pari, believing in mindless memorising over understanding, in order to reach his goals of corporate and social status. Pari constantly spars with Virus and Srivatsan due to their differences in their educational approaches. Pari also believes in the concept of ""All Is Well"", in which people should focus on the present and live it as it is, instead of worrying over the future as in the case of Senthil, who constantly thinks of the fate of his unmarried elder sister and his paralysed father. Meanwhile, Pari falls in love with Virus' daughter Ria , a medical student, when he, Venkat and Senthil meet her when they accidentally crash her elder sister Swetha's  wedding reception to obtain a free meal. Ria is not impressed with Pari's antics and complains to her father about them. Virus becomes furious with Pari and his friends, labels them as ""idiots"" and tries to break the friendship between the 3 of them by telling Senthil and Venkat that Pari is a bad influence on them. While Venkat refuses to break his friendship with Pari, Senthil believes Virus' words and distances himself from Pari. However, when Pari saves Senthil's father's life, who had suffered a heart attack, by taking him immediately to the hospital where Ria works on the latter's scooter when the ambulance had not come, Senthil becomes grateful to Pari and reconciles with him. Ria too appreciates Pari's practicality and concern for others and falls in love with him. Later, in the semester examination, Pari tops his batch, proving that the his approach to studies does succeed. 3 years later, Pari, Venkat and Senthil break into Virus's house in a drunken state one night to allow Pari to confess his love to Ria. Venkat and Senthil cause a ruckus and urinate on the front door before fleeing. Unfortunately, Virus notices Senthil and the next day, he threatens to expel him unless he snitches on Pari. Not wanting to betray his friend or let down his family, Senthil attempts suicide by jumping from Virus' office window and ends up paralysed. Following his recovery, Senthil discards his fear of the future. Encouraged by Pari, both Senthil and Venkat gain courage to do what they were afraid to do before. Senthil takes a bold and frank approach in a campus interview, while Venkat tries to convince his parents to allow him to pursue his love of wildlife photography. Both Senthil and Venkat are successful in their endeavours. When Virus discovers that Senthil is successfully placed in a company, he creates an extremely tough final semester question paper, so that Senthil fails the examination and would not be allowed to join the company. When Ria learns of her father's plan, she helps Pari and Venkat to leak the question paper by providing them with the keys to her father's office. However, Virus catches them and expels them on the spot. Ria angrily confronts her father, revealing to him that his son  wanted to be a writer, but was forced to apply for engineering in IEC because of him. As he could not get selected there, he committed suicide. At the same time, Swetha, who is pregnant, goes into labour. A heavy thunderstorm cuts all power and floods the streets, making it impossible for the ambulance to reach Swetha, and Ria is stuck at the hospital, where she had gone for work. Pari, Venkat and Senthil, along with other students from IEC, deliver the baby using the available equipment and the inverter developed by Pari, with Ria instructing him via VoIP. When they discover that the newborn baby is apparently stillborn, Pari resuscitates the baby by saying ""All is Well"". Virus forgives Pari and his friends, gives Pari his treasured pen in gratitude and allows them to appear for the final semester examination. Pari eventually graduates as the ""Most Outstanding Student"" in his batch. After the convocation however, Pari disappears and goes into seclusion. 7 years later, Venkat and Senthil set out on a journey to Ooty to find Pari. They are joined by Srivatsan, who is now a wealthy and successful professional in the USA and is looking to seal a deal with a famous scientist and prospective business associate named Kosaksi Pasapugazh. Srivatsan's main intention in finding Pari is to find out whether Pari is more successful than him; they had made a bet 10 years ago on who would be more successful with their study approaches after Pari had humiliated him at a college function. However, when they find Pari's house in Ooty, they find a completely different man: the real Panchavan Parivendan . Confronting the real Pari, they find out from him that their friend was actually a destitute servant boy named Pappu. Pappu, who worked in Pari's household, loved learning, while Pari disliked studies. After seeing the boy's intelligence, Pari's father  agreed to allow Pappu study in Pari's place instead of working as a servant. In return, Pari would pocket Pappu's qualifications and after graduating, Pappu will cease all contact with Pari and his family. Pari reveals that Pappu is now a schoolteacher in Dhanushkodi. Later, Venkat and Senthil find out that as the fake Pari had disappeared, Ria had decided to marry her former boyfriend- a price obsessed banker whom she had dumped when the fake Pari made her realise that he loves his expensive items more than her. Venkat and Senthil rescue Ria from her wedding in Coimbatore and they along with Srivatsan drive to Dhanushkodi. At the fake Pari's school, Venkat and Senthil reunite with their long-lost friend, Ria and the fake Pari rekindle their romance, and Srivatsan mocks the fake Pari for becoming a lowly schoolteacher. He asks him to sign a ""Declaration of Defeat"" document for losing the bet. The fake Pari signs the document and when Srivatsan sees the signature, he is shocked to find out that the fake Pari's real name is actually Kosaksi Pasupugazh. Srivatsan accepts defeat and begs Kosaksi to sign the business deal, which the latter apparently refuses."

In order to seek revenge, he joins their college by changing his name to Rohit Menon. He becomes a friend of Joe Joseph , one of the guys in the gang. Ananthakrishnan alias Rohit now irks the notorious fivesome. He poisons the mind of Joe Joseph against the other four, making him believe that the most notorious among them, Sathish, who is also the son of the Home Minister , is simply making use of them. The five of them, annoyed with Ananthu, plot to frame him in a molestation case and get him ousted from the college. Rakhi plays a trick on him, calling him to a posh hotel room on the pretext of telling him something important. Ananthu goes, only to be pounced upon forcefully by Anu. Ananthu tries to push her away, but she doesn't let go. This sequence of events is secretly recorded by the rest on video, and it appears as though Ananthu has molested Anu. Now the five of them appear, and in anger, Ananthu slaps Rakhi. Enraged at that, Joseph attacks Ananthu and wounds him, thus killing him on the spot. These subsequent events also get recorded on camera. Thinking he is dead, the gang decide to bury Ananthu and cover up the homicide. Joseph keeps the video tape with him. As Joe and Anand are trying to take the body, the are intercepted by police, whom Joseph just evades and speeds off. But before the police can take action,Satheesh arrives in another car and being the son of the CM, he requests the cops to leave the boys as they were ""high"". The five scoundrels then meet and bury the body. The gang now try to continue their lives as usual, but not for long. It soon appears to some of them as though Ananthu alias Rohith has come back.But Sathish rubbishes it all and does not believe any of it. The first person to be killed is Joseph. After a late night party, he happens to stumble in the anatomy lab out of curiosity when he sees someone,presumed to be Rohit, lurking there. He is then attacked by Rohit and hanged in the lab. Inspector Sudeep appears on the scene as the investigating officer. He investigates the case and realizes that something is very fishy about the gang of five. He especially suspects Sathish. The remaining arrogant four assume that Joseph commit suicide, but things don't go well for long. Sudeep investigates about everyone from a notorious college doctor Munthiri Paadam alias Shine Rajand gathers facts. He comes to know about Rohit, and that he never really was a student or house surgeon at the colleges he claimed to be from. Sudeep now starts investigating about the missing Ananthu/ Rohit, worsening tension for the four scoundrels. On the pretext of consoling Joe's parents,they arrive at his house and secretly take the video tape, which Satheesh keeps. Satheesh and Anand attack Shine raj for telling things to police, but he evades them and dashes for the woods, and as fate would have it, he stumbles exactly upon the same site where Rohit was buried. The body is now exhumed by Sudeep, who continues to investigate the murder of Rohit. The next person to be murdered is Rakhi. As Anu and Rakhi are one day returning on a late evening, passing through desolate grounds, they lose balance and fall, when Anu thinks she sees Rohit and startles Rakhi. Anu gets injured and faints. At this point, Rohit appears on the scene and bludgeons Rakhi to death with a log of wood. Anand realizes that he probably is the next victim, and decides to leave for his hometown immediately. As he nears his house at night, he is attacked by Rohit, forcefully bound and thrown before a fast moving truck on the highway. Now the remaining two are in panic. Anu is hospitalized, where she tells everything to her parents, at which Satheesh gets enraged. Anu's parents decide to tell Sudeep everything and they call him, but Satheesh warns them that even their only daughter will be in trouble if they do so. Terrified that she will be convicted, her parents do not tell sudeep anything. But the latter understands. As Anu's parents are getting her discharged from hospital, she is forcefully carried alone in the elevator to the top desolate floor of the hospitalm, where she is pushed into the oprerating room, and Rohit appears and cuts her entire body with a scalpel. Now suspicion falls on the only one still alive - Satheesh. Sudeep goes to his house, forcefully arrests him, searches and finds the tape. He then proceeds to bring him to book by showing the tape in court. Unfortunately his co inspector falls for Satheesh's money and replaces the tape for something else. Now Satheesh is acquitted of all crimes. The enraged sudeep thrashes the traitor, and warns Satheesh's family that though the brat may have escaped the law, Satheesh will be murdered next. Sudeep also comes to know that the exhumed body is not that of anyone named Rohit. Rohit now attacks Satheesh at his house, and tries to drown him in the swimming pool, but is taken by surprise by Inspector Sudeep and an army of policemen who would be hiding in the minister's house. Now Rohit alias Ananthakrishnan is arrested. He confesses to Sudeep that it was his idea all together. His beloved Athira was brutally murdered by Satheesh and his friends, and to cover up the crimes, Satheesh also murdered his uncle and aunt through a car accident. To take revenge, he enrolled himself for house surgeoncy in the same hospital, and poisoned the minds of all the 5 scoundrels. He particularly had chosen Joe. It was Joe who had attacked him on purpose, and who had told everyone that Rohit had died in the hotel. When he had sped away in the jeep from police, he took a deviation to the anatomy lab, where Rohit got off, and a cadaver was put in the car covered with blankets. Joe then caught up with the other four and buried the cadaver. Rohit then murdered Joe first as he knew his secret, then remained in hiding and murdered three of the gang.He also admits that he has no remorse for his actions. He would have anyways surrendered to police after all 5 were gone. Sudeep sympathises with Rohit. Rohit alias Anathu is arrested but as he is being taken to court, the police, bribed by Satheesh, take him to the sea harbour, wher Rohit meets the wicked Satheesh, who says he wants to personally take revenge on the former, and that it was he who killed Rohit's loved ones. The enraged Ananthu breaks from the police, thrashes them all and runs after the terrified Satheesh. He follows him clinging to the latter's jeeop, and they reach a bridge, where he beats Satheesh. Sudeep and the cops arrive on the scene and warns Ananthu to stop, but he throws Satheesh off the bridge, thus killing him. The film ends there."

Tunnel digger Matt MacLachlan  head of the team of ""Sandhogs""  has witnessed lava seeping into the city's aqueduct system and knows the unimaginable truth. A group of tramps trying to keep warm in Central Park near a heat vent all die from carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide poisoning. A boat in the harbour is caught in a venting and explodes. The FBI Terror Task Force appears looking for the imagined terrorists who killed the tramps and blew up the boat. Matt is taken off of the digging as some of his men were badly injured or killed and there is a need to investigate. Pipes which were supposed to carry water are filled with steaming acid thanks to the volcano. He meets Susan who he was married to for three years previously and who has been sent to interview him on what happened and convinces her that there is something seriously wrong in tunnel number three. Together they sneak down into the tunnels which have been sealed off and she sees enough to believe him. Doctor Andrew Levering  has been conducting a geo-thermal energy experiment which has triggered the volcanic activity as his project drills below seven miles into the earth in a secret location hidden in a warehouse in downtown New York. Neil Kavanagh and others are financing this project but since there has been no results they are ready to stop the funding forcing Levering to take more chances to produce instant results. Matt and Susan go to the Mayor but her boss Reed lets her down and Kavanagh who is there also manages to make the idea of a volcano look impossible so the Mayor dismisses them. Shortly afterwards a Home Owner opens the door to his house to be buried by a stream of molten lava. The whole block of houses go up in flames with 72 people missing, presumed dead and the Mayor begins to wonder while Agent Walters of the FBI's TTF is given leave to do whatever he has to do. Using a hand-held thermal detector, Matt and Susan drive around the suspected area and find unnatural heat coming from a warehouse. They enter but Matt is recognised by Levering who has them bound as prisoners. In an effort to produce results, Levering goes too far and the workers start to desert as flames leap from the drill hole. He tries to seal it but is badly burned by the flames. Meanwhile, Matt and Susan manage to escape as the unleashed lava causes the warehouse to blow up. Levering's latest efforts are seen on the streets of New York as lava spouts out of manholes and buildings catch alight, killing thousands and causing untold damage. The Mayor sees what is happening from his office and Kavanagh reluctantly admits his part. He decides on an evacuation of the city. But all is not lost as Matt has an idea which he puts to his work crew. An explosion in the right place will divert the lava along the city's aqueduct tunnels and into the nearby sea. The race is then on to do it in time, but Levering - who survived his burns and is now stalking the streets of the city with a gun - learns of their plans via a television broadcast that also announced over one thousand counts of murder to be handed down against him. The deranged doctor follows the team into the tunnels and faces Matt and Susan as they attempt to set the charges necessary to open the tunnels. Delusively believing that his project is still viable, Levering shoots Matt, but one of his shots goes astray and destabilizes the wall, releasing steam that blinds him. Matt and Susan escape the tunnels just in time to avoid the lava flow, while Levering is killed in the eruption. Their plan works and the city is saved. The film was filmed on location in Times Square, Midtown Manhattan, Manhattan, New York City, New York."

Commander Nathan Walker, Lieutenant Colonel John Grey, and Captain Ben Anderson are launched toward the Moon to place detectors to alert the United States of any impending ICBM attacks from the USSR. Grey remains in orbit aboard the Freedom Command module while Walker and Anderson land on the moon in the lunar module Liberty. While planting one of the detectors, the pair take moon rock samples. After returning to Liberty, the pair hear noises outside and a camera captures a small rock moving nearby. Houston claims the noises are interference from the ICBM detectors. Anderson finds a rock sample on the floor of Liberty despite having secured the samples. During further lunar exploration they discover footprints that lead them to a bloodstained, functioning Soviet LK lander, and a dead cosmonaut in a nearby crater. Walker queries Houston about the Soviet presence but is told only to continue with the mission. The following day the pair find that the flag they had planted is missing. Their mission complete, the crew prepares to leave, but the launch is aborted when Liberty suffers violent shaking. An inspection reveals extensive damage to Liberty and non-human tracks that Walker cites as evidence of extraterrestrial life. Walker feels something moving inside his spacesuit and is horrified as a spider-like creature crawls across the inside of his helmet. Walker disappears from view and Anderson finds him unconscious outside of Liberty. Walker later denies the events. A wound is discovered on Walker's chest; Anderson removes a moon rock embedded within him. The pair find themselves unable to contact Houston or Grey due to increased levels of interference from an unknown source. Anderson speculates that the true intention of the ICBM warning devices is to monitor the aliens, and that the devices are the source of the interference, only to discover something has destroyed them when they attempt to switch them off. Walker shows signs of a developing infection and he becomes increasingly paranoid. The mission cameras capture the rock samples moving around in the interior of Liberty, revealing that the aliens are concealed as moon rocks. Increasingly delusional, Walker attempts to destroy the cameras within Liberty but accidentally damages the system controls, causing Liberty to depressurize. Realizing the Soviet LK is their only source of oxygen, the pair travel towards the LK lander in their lunar rover. Walker causes the vehicle to crash as he runs away, believing he should not leave the moon because of the risk of spreading the infection to Earth. Anderson awakens and tracks Walker to the crater where they found the cosmonaut. Walker is pulled into the crater by the creatures. Anderson gives chase, but is confronted by the aliens, and flees to the Soviet LK. Anderson uses its radio to contact USSR Mission Control who connect him to the DoD. The deputy secretary informs Anderson that they cannot allow him to return to Earth, admitting they are aware of the situation and fear he is also infected. Anderson manages to contact Grey and they make arrangements for Anderson to return to Freedom. Anderson prepares the lander for launch but it is attacked by a psychotic Walker. Before Walker can enter the vehicle, he is attacked by a swarm of the creatures, which breach his helmet, killing him. Anderson launches, but the DoD warns Grey that Anderson is infected and orders him to abort the rescue or communication will be ceased, rendering Grey unable to return to Earth. As the lander enters orbit, the reduced gravity causes small rocks within the craft to float, some of which reveal themselves to be alien creatures. Anderson is attacked and infected by the creatures, preventing him from controlling the vehicle, leaving it headed uncontrolled toward Freedom. The space footage ends abruptly. The footage cuts to before the pilots' mission, showing them having a barbecue with friends and family. The ""official"" fate of the astronauts is given, describing them as having died in various accidents that left their bodies unrecoverable.

After too many drinks on her 30th birthday, Rachel grabs a cab with Dex  and playfully reveals she has had a crush on him since law school. The problem is, Dex is also her best friend Darcy's  fiancé. They wake up in bed together the next morning to Darcy calling both of their phones. Dex sneaks out and they do not have time to speak about what happened between them. Rachel initially believes the encounter is a one night stand, but it is actually the beginning of a sincere affair once Dex tells Rachel he is in love with her. What also follows is a web of lies created by Rachel and Dex to Darcy and several others. Rachel continuously conjures up false stories of sexual relationships with Ethan and Marcus to cover up her sexual encounters with Dex. Ethan  has been friends with Darcy and Rachel since childhood. He is the only one who knows what has happened between Rachel and Dex, which he is reluctantly keeping a secret. Meanwhile, Dex's mother  has been suffering from depression for some time and Dex and Darcy's wedding is the only thing keeping her sane and happy. When Dex skips out on 4th of July weekend in the Hamptons to stay in the City and spend time with Rachel, they run into his parents. His father suspects something is going on between the two of them and he tells Dex to end it as soon as possible, saying that what he wants should not be considered a priority when it conflicts with what is right. Considering his mother and father's feelings, Dex gives Rachel the cold shoulder and leaves her to go back to Darcy. As the wedding nears, Dex and Rachel are speaking less and less. At the beach, their secret is almost revealed by Ethan, who is frustrated with Rachel, especially for lying to people she cares about, but Rachel stops him by hitting him in the face with a badminton racket. This results in his nose becoming very badly broken. Ethan is frustrated with Rachel because she doesn't see that he is the only one who really cares about her. That night at the bar, Rachel finally tells Dex that she wants him to call off the wedding so they can be together, but he tells her that he can't. Ethan moves to London for a job and Rachel flies out to visit him. He reveals that he loves her and just wants to see her happy, but is sad that Rachel refuses to see what's right in front of her. Rachel returns to New York to find Dex sitting on her doorstep. He reveals that he ended things with Darcy and called off the wedding. Rachel is ecstatic until Darcy ends up at her door begging to come in to talk. Dex hides and Darcy enters her apartment. She tells Rachel that she has been cheating on him with his friend Marcus. She is also pregnant with Marcus' child and says that they are very happy. Rachel gives her her blessing and Darcy proceeds to leave but only to return and ask what Dex's jacket is doing in her apartment. Dex then comes out and Darcy figures out Rachel is the other woman. She becomes infuriated and storms out of the apartment, telling Rachel that she hates her. Two months later, Rachel and Darcy run into each other on the street. They have not spoken since the incident and Darcy says that she is happy, but doesn't sound so convincing. Rachel is unapologetic for sleeping with Dex but is sorry for hurting Darcy. As they leave, they turn back and glance at each other, with Darcy smiling and waving. Rachel walks around the corner to Dex sitting on a bench. They walk down the street together. The film ends with an ambiguous scene during the credits. Darcy shows up to surprise Ethan in London; Ethan tries to ignore her and briskly walks away.

1273501Early in the Second World War, a raiding party of six Nazi sailors, caught ashore when their U-boat is sunk in Hudson Bay, attempt to evade capture by travelling across Canada to the still-neutral United States. The film's title comes from the 49th parallel north which marks part of the border between the two countries. Led by Lieutenants Hirth  and Kuhnecke , the small band of sailors encounter and sometimes brutalize a wide range of people, including the Eskimo Nick , the French-Canadian trapper , the floatplane crew and local Eskimo onlookers, pacifistic German Hutterite farmers, an innocent motorist, and the eccentric English academic and author ([[Leslie Howard . Making their way across Canada first using a stolen seaplane, the five surviving members of the Nazi band try to stir up sympathy among the Hutterite community outside Winnipeg, believing them to be countrymen. Lieutenant Hirth's stirring speech is rejected by Peter , the community's leader, and even by one of their own, Vogel , who comes to the aid of Anna . Vogel is tried by Lieutenant Hirth and summarily executed for the greater crime of trying to break away from the Nazi group. Hijacking an innocent motorist for his automobile, Hirth, Lohrmann and Kranz flee West. With all of Canada searching for them, and having killed 11 civilians along the way, Lohrmann is arrested by Canadian Mounties at a public gathering.

Finally, the story comes to a head with a confrontation on a freight train between Hirth, the sole remaining fugitive at large, and AWOL Canadian soldier Andy Brock . When Hirth learns the train has crossed into the United States, he surrenders his gun to a customs official and demands to be taken to the German embassy in the U.S. . However, Brock points out that Hirth is locked in the freight hold, but is not listed on the freight manifest, and convinces both American customs officials instead, that the freight car together with Hirth and Brock be sent back to Canada as ""improperly manifested cargo"" - which they readily comply with. The film ends with the train reversing to Canada and Brock about to pummel Hirth in the boxcar.

13379536The book club is the brainchild of fiftysomething six-time divorcée Bernadette, who latches onto the idea when she meets Prudie, a prim, married high school French teacher in her mid-20s, at a Jane Austen film festival. Her concept is to have six members discuss all of Austen's six novels, with each member hosting the group once a month. Also inducted into the club are Sylvia, a fortysomething librarian who recently has separated from her philandering lawyer husband Daniel after more than two decades of marriage; Sylvia's 20-something lesbian daughter Allegra; Jocelyn, a happily unmarried control freak and breeder of Rhodesian Ridgebacks who has been Sylvia's friend since childhood; and Grigg, a science fiction fan who's roped into the group by Jocelyn with the hope he and Sylvia will prove to be a compatible match. As the months pass, each of the members develops characteristics similar to those of Austen's characters and reacts to events in their lives in much the same way their fictional counterparts would. Bernadette is the matriarch figure who longs to see everyone find happiness. Sylvia clings to her belief in steadfast love and devotion, and eventually reconciles with Daniel. Jocelyn denies her own feelings for Grigg while playing matchmaker for him and Sylvia. Prudie, encumbered with her inattentive husband Dean and a free-spirited, pot-smoking, aging-hippie mother, a product of the 1960s counterculture, finds herself desperately trying not to succumb to her feelings for her seductive student Trey. Allegra, who tends to meet her lovers while engaging in death-defying activities, feels betrayed when she discovers her current partner, aspiring writer Corinne, has used Allegra's life as the basis for her short stories. Grigg is attracted to Jocelyn and mystified by her seeming lack of interest in him, marked by her failure to read the Ursula K. Le Guin novels he has hoped will catch her fancy. He also serves as the comedic foil to Jocelyn and Prudie's very serious takes on the books.

22778879The original plot is more-or-less adhered to, with some significant alterations. Benny is depicted as a comic Bob Hope-like coward, but not as a sissy. El Khobar's alter ego is that of a mild-mannered  Latin tutor and anthropologist, whom Birabeau hires to keep Margot from flirting with his regiment. The conclusion to the film is slightly different, since El Khobar is not Birabeau's son here. After the final battle, the General's soldiers realize that El Khobar and the Riffs were actually on their side and helped in preventing an uprising. When one asks, ""And where is El Khobar?"", MacRae, as the professor, enters carrying El Khobar's clothes, and quietly announces ""El Khobar is dead"". Margot is grief-stricken, but Birabeau, suspecting the truth, mischievously says that they can all be grateful to ""the ghost of El Khobar"", winking as he says this. As soon as they are alone, MacRae begins to sing the song One Alone to Margot, making her realize that her boring Latin tutor and the dashing El Khobar are one and the same. She rushes into his arms.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stidFull%20Synopsis One song not by Romberg, Gay Parisienne, written for the 1943 film version of the show, is retained for this film.
1937542Living In Oblivion is divided into three parts, all of which concern the making of a low-budget movie featuring the same director, crew and substantially the same cast. Part one: Director Nick Reve  is shooting a low-budget independent film in the middle of New York City. The catering crew are under-funded and apathetic, deciding not to replace a carton of milk that has been on the craft service table for a week. The scene being shot is a difficult one: a young woman, Ellen, reproaches her elderly mother  for not intervening when the father beat Ellen as a child. However, on the set, just about everything that can go wrong does go wrong: shots are spoiled because of the mic boom is visible; the camera assistant fails to keep the shot in focus; Cora, the actress playing the mother, forgets her lines; and Nicole, the actress playing Ellen, becomes increasingly unfocused and careless. A dispirited Nick calls for a rehearsal without camera to refresh the actors. However, when Nicole  berates herself for acting badly, Cora  reassures her with a gesture that reminds Nicole of a similar gesture made by her own terminally ill mother. Nicole is so upset by the memory that she turns in an unexpectedly passionate performance; and Cora, startled by Nicole's sudden intensity, is equally good. Watching them, Nick becomes enthusiastic all over again. Unfortunately, it was not captured on film; cinematographer and camera operator Wolf , who has been diluting the sub-standard coffee with the spoiled milk, was vomiting in the toilet throughout. Nick ruefully calls for another take. This time, a sudden and insistent beeping sound distracts the actors. Nobody can tell where it's coming from; and Nick flies into a rage, berating everyone on the crew and cast for their inadequacies. He then wakes up in his own bed; the beeping sound was his own alarm clock. He has dreamed the entire segment. It is 4.30am; and he is due on set. Part two: Early the same morning, the film's lead actor Chad Palomino  is getting dressed in Nicole's hotel room. They have spent the night together, and Chad suggests that they might get together again later; Nicole politely declines. Chad and Nicole arrive on the set separately. Nicole's character Ellen and Chad's character Damian have been in love for years but have never admitted it until the scene being shot on this day. Shooting the scene is made practically impossible by Chad's irregular acting. He keeps changing his mind about where to stand and continually moves to places where he is either invisible or badly lit by scenic light. Nicole becomes increasingly frustrated by Chad's egomania; and, when he starts to stroke her head, she briefly loses her cool, then apologizes. An irritated Chad demands a private talk with Nick. He tells Nick that he has slept with Nicole and makes out that it was she, not he, who had wanted to continue the relationship. Desperate to keep Chad happy, Nick agrees that Nicole is not very good. Nicole overhears this conversation on the sound mixer's headphones. Pretending to be contrite, she asks Nick if they can improvise a little; but, when they do so, she announces to everyone that, although she slept with Chad, she is not at all interested in him. Chad loses his temper and quits the movie. Relieved that he will no longer have to please Chad, Nick calls him a ""Hostess Twinkie motherfucker"" and a fight breaks out. Nick beats Chad senseless and fires him. He apologises to Nicole and confesses that he loves her. They kiss—then Nicole abruptly wakes up, still in her bed, having dreamed the whole thing. Part three: Later the same day, the crew is setting up for a dream sequence in which Nicole, as Ellen, stands still while a dwarf walks around her holding an apple. Nick claims to have learned a lesson from his own dream: That sometimes, ""you just got to roll with things."" Nicole admits that she had a dream with Nick in it but doesn't tell him what happened. Nick manages to keep up his positive attitude despite the various mishaps that occur: The smoke machine fails to work, then it catches fire, then his senile mother Cora arrives on the set. However, the ill-tempered dwarf actor Tito  complains that the dream sequence is a cliché  and walks off the set in disgust. Nick's confidence collapses, and he announces that the movie is over. At that moment, his mother intervenes, grabbing the apple, moving to Tito's mark and announcing that she is ""ready"". The crew scrambles to shoot the scene, and her manic performance injects fresh energy and conviction into it. Nick is delighted and decides to keep the new dream sequence, and there is a tense moment while the sound mixer records 30 seconds of room tone. The entire cast and crew manages to remain silent, and they go on to shooting the next sequence.
31555231In flashback, Niall , a local news reporter, recalls visiting his mother's grave, as he smartens up in a toilet mirror. His colleague Tammy  knocks on the toilet door to hurry him up and as they walk to the car she instructs him on the art of the 'death-knock': knocking on the doors of the recently bereaved to obtain quotes and pictures of the deceased for the newspaper. Niall's poor track record has put his job on the line and Tammy has been detailed to improve his hit-rate. When they reach the house of Mrs Wright, who has lost her son in a car accident, Niall goes in first while Tammy waits outside. Before Niall can introduce himself and launch into his spiel that Tammy has prepared for him, Mrs Wright  interrupts him - ""I know who you are"" - and ushers him into the house. There she ropes him into unstacking the dishwasher as Niall tries in vain to broach the subject of the bereavement against the sound of a fire alarm which has been set off by the cigarette Mrs Wright is smoking. Mrs Wright appears baffled by Niall's requests for pictures and instead offers him some soup telling him they will look at some pictures ""in the morning"", much to Niall's surprise. She then leads him upstairs to the bedroom and encourages him to get some rest. Trapped in the bedroom, Niall examines the dead boy's belongings and finds himself playing with his toys. Meanwhile, Tammy waits outside taking a phone call from her boss at the newspaper, to whom she explains that Niall ""is still in there, so he must be doing alright"". Whilst playing with a light sabre, Niall knocks off a shelf-load of items and as he picks them up, he finds a photo of the dead boy. Mrs Wright, alerted by the noise, appears behind him and embracing Niall, she tells him: ""it's been a long day: time for bed."" Tammy knocks at the door and attempts to talk to Mrs Wright about the accident in which her son was killed, but Mrs Wright replies that her son is in his room and that there must be some mistake. Closing the door, she is nonetheless shaken by Tammy's insistence that her son is dead and she climbs the stairs to the bedroom where she finds Niall tucked up fast asleep in her son's bed. She kisses him on the cheek and switches out the light.
384141The story revolves around a farmer Shambu Mahato , who lives with his wife Parvati `Paro’  and son Kanhaiya  in a small village that has been hit badly by a famine. After years of drought, the region finally gets rain, leading to the farmers to rejoice. Shambu owns two bighas  of land, which is the only means of livelihood for the whole family. The local zamindar  Thakur Harnam Singh ([[Murad  partners with some city business men to construct a mill on his large parcel of land, which in return would profit them and bring prosperity to the village. The only problem is that in the middle of Harnam singh's land lay Shambu's meager two bighas of land. Harnam Singh is very confident that he could buy Shambu's land. Shambu has borrowed money from Harnam Singh several times in the past and has not paid back his debt. Harnam Singh calls for Shambu and proposes Shambu to sell his land to him in exchange for his debt. Shambu disagrees to sell his only livelihood and Harnam Singh gets upset. Harnam Singh orders him to pay back his debt by the next day or risk auctioning his land. Shambu comes back home to discuss the issue with his father, and with the help of his son, they figure out that the debt amounts to 65 rupees. Shambu wants to save his land by all means and sells all his household items including his wife's gold earrings. When Shambu meets Harman Singh's accountant to pay back his debt of 65 rupees, he's shocked to know that he actually owes 235 rupees. The accountant had forged the accounts and now refuses to consider the labor provided by Shambu's father Gangu as portion of debt payoff. The case goes to court and Shambu being an illiterate, has a tough time explaining to the judge how the accountant forged the numbers and how he took accountant's word of mouth and did not demand any receipt. Shambu loses the case, however the judge orders Shambu to pay back 235 rupees to Harnam Singh in three months. If Shambu is not able to pay back his debt, then his land would be auctioned off and the proceeds would go to pay off his debts. Shambu now struggles to get the money and he is unable to get a loan because he has no collaterals. One of his village friends gives him an idea to go to Calcutta  and try to get a job to earn enough money to pay off his debt.

Looking at the condition of his father, Kanhaiya joins a pick pocketer in order to earn quick money. Shambu gets mad and beats Kanhaiya when he comes to know about his dirty earnings. Meanwhile, Parvati gets worried since she receives no letters or money from Shambu and the Zamindar's accountant accuses Shambu that he has forgotten his family. She ends up working on a local construction site and gets devastated when she receives the news that Shambu has met with an accident. Finally, Parvati decides to visit Shambu in the city even though Gangu is on bed rest suffering of high fever. Parvati arrives in Calcutta, and is taken by a strange man, who claims he knows Shambu and will take her to him. He takes her to his shed and tries to steal and force her. She flees from him, but comes under a car. The crowd gathers around her and they call for a rickshaw to take her to the hospital.

20841547Somewhere in Beverly Hills, in the house of Jack Benny , a mouse version of Jack is practicing his violin---off key---and saying to himself, ""Who is this guy Isaac Stern?""  Outside Jack's mouse hole, a cat is lying in wait, wearing ear muffs to filter out the discordant sound of Jack's violin. Jack calls his servant, Rochester  to get his white suit, which Rochester is wearing at the time. Jack tells the valet that his rental period is up  and he needs the suit because he is taking Mary Livingstone out for her birthday, and, true to character, is looking for a good cheap restaurant. While waiting for Mary, Jack decides to count his cheese in a basement vault. Using a coin on a string, he opens the lock, which appears to be a coin-operated lock from a pay toilet. As soon as he walks through the door, he takes a cane from a nail on the wall and starts humming We're in the Money. When he reaches the bottom of the stairs, he reaches through a hole and trips a razor blade hanging above the passageway like a guillotine. He then comes up to a derringer and uses the cane to trip the trigger on the derringer. Finally, he comes up to another hole, reaches through with the cane and trips a mousetrap. He then reaches the vault door, opens a combination lock, pulls the door open and numerous sound effects including various alarms, a foghorn and machine gun noises are heard. Ed, the vault guard, asks ""who goes there?"", and then an exchange is heard where Ed, apparently having been in the vault for a long time, asks ""did we win the war yet?"" When Benny assures Ed that the war had been won, thinking that Ed was referring to World War II, Ed says: ""That's good. What do you think we'll do with the Kaiser?"" Mary arrives while Jack is inspecting his cheese vault, and he emerges wondering who has been pilfering his gorgonzola. A fat rodent version of Don Wilson attempts to deliver a commercial when Jack advises him that this is a movie and not a television program. When Mary suggests a place, Jack's eyes ring up like an old cash register with a dollar sign  and ""no sale"", they discuss other options. As they were discussing the options, the cat writes a message extolling the ""Kit Kat Club""  and sends it to Jack as a paper airplane. Jack and Mary putter off in his Maxwell with Rochester behind the wheel until they reach the Kit Kat Club by following the arrows pointing to it. While enroute, Mary asks for champagne, while Jack says that he prefers a good ""mousecatel"". Unbeknownst to them, the ""club"" is actually the maw of a real cat, and as they enter, the cat's mouth closes on them. Jack cries: ""Help! Help!"" as the camera cuts to the live-action Jack Benny, who wakes up and, breaking the fourth wall, tells the audience: ""Gosh, what a crazy dream! Imagine- Mary and me as two little mice trapped inside a cat's mouth! And me playing the violin!"" At that point, Jack is interrupted by the sound of a discordant ""Rock-a-Bye Baby"" played on the violin, coming from within Jack's live-action cat. From there, the rodent versions of Jack and Mary emerge unharmed from the live-action cat. Following one last bit of animation , the real Jack Benny does one of his famous ""takes"" as the cartoon fades out.
1730420While driving cross-country from Boston to San Diego in their new Jeep Grand Cherokee, Jeff Taylor and his wife Amy narrowly miss colliding with a beat-up Ford F-150 that darts in front of them from an connecting road on a deserted highway. Later, while stopped at a gas station, the truck's driver, Earl, exchanges hostile words with Jeff before the couple resume their journey. Shortly afterwards, their Jeep breaks down in the middle of the desert. Leaving Jeff with the car, Amy accepts a ride from a passing big-rig trucker named Red Barr driving a Peterbilt 385, to get to a nearby diner and call for help. Jeff eventually discovers that the Jeep's battery connections have been suspiciously tampered with, and, after reconnecting them, drives to the diner, only to find that no one has seen his wife. When he catches up with Barr on the road and forces him to stop, the trucker claims he has never seen Jeff or his wife before. Jeff hails a passing sheriff, named Boyd, but a brief search of Barr's truck yields no sign of Amy, and he is let go. Jeff then goes to a police station where he is advised by a deputy to go back to the diner and wait for his wife. There Jeff meets with a simpleton mechanic named Billy, who says he saw Amy arrive in one truck and leave in another. He tells Jeff where they have taken her, but refuses to speak with the police, thinking that they are involved. Jeff heads to the location Billy mentioned, but is ambushed on a back road by Earl, and escapes by driving his Jeep into a river. Abandoning the Jeep and later circling back to watch his attackers salvage the Jeep from the water, Jeff is discovered and knocked out by Billy, an accomplice who had feigned mental impairment earlier. Jeff awakens in a car trunk surrounded by Earl, Billy, another accomplice, Al, a tow-truck driver, and their leader, Red Barr. Red tells Jeff that his wife will be released in exchange for $90,000 that the kidnappers think Jeff has in his bank account. Knowing that he only has a small fraction of the assumed amount, Jeff enters a nearby bank to withdraw what little money he has. After a failed attempt to alert the bank manager to his danger, Jeff steals marked money ribbons and a letter opener from the manager's desk; Jeff uses money ribbons to packet $1 bills in-between two $100 bills, fooling the kidnappers. With the ransom now in hand, Jeff is then instructed by phone to leave town, where he is picked up and bound with duct tape by Earl in his pickup truck. While gloating about how easy Jeff and his wife were to abduct by rigging their car to break down after leaving the gas station, as well as bragging that he intends to kill Jeff and his wife anyway, Earl discovers Jeff's ruse with the ransom. At exactly the same moment, Jeff frees himself and stabs Earl in the chest with the letter opener. After a struggle in the speeding, swerving pickup, Jeff takes over the vehicle, bounds Earl, and forces him to reveal his rendezvous with Red at a local truck stop. Sheriff Boyd appears in his patrol car and, seeing the swerving pickup, calls for backup and stops the vehicle. After Jeff exits the truck with Earl's pistol in hand, a stressed Boyd mistakes the situation and forces Jeff at gunpoint down onto the road. Earl frees himself and shoots Boyd with another pistol concealed in his boot. Just as Earl is about to shoot Jeff, a wounded Boyd shoots and kills Earl. Jeff uses Boyd's radio to call for an ambulance and heads to the truck stop Earl mentioned. At the rest stop, Jeff avoids the police looking for him in connection to the shooting of Boyd, and then spots Red talking on a payphone with another accomplice. Jeff follows Red to his truck where he jumps under the moving truck as Red drives away. Jeff loses his pistol while climbing aboard, but stows away to Red's farm at which he arrives early the next morning. Hiding in a barn, Jeff watches as Red and his remaining accomplices take a bound and gagged Amy and lock her in a freezer in the barn's cellar, leaving her to die. Unable to open the locked cellar door, Jeff finds a gun in Red's truck and uses it to hold Red, his accomplices, and his wife and son at gunpoint, demands the cellar key. Billy escapes, but Jeff forces the rest of the group to safely release Amy from the freezer before locking them in the cellar. Jeff and Amy then flee in a stolen Chevrolet C-20 pickup, while Billy frees Red and Al. They pursue the Taylors in their respective vehicles. During the climactic chase, Billy is killed in a fiery crash when Jeff forces his car off the road, while the trailer from Red's truck detaches, causing Al to violently crash into it. Undeterred, Red attempts to ram Jeff's vehicle off a bridge, trapping Amy's leg underneath the dashboard. Red's big rig nearly falls off the edge and becomes suspended by a steel bridge support. Jeff battles Red on the suspended big rig, eventually hurling Red to the rocks below. Jeff frees Amy from the dashboard in which she  pulls the automatic shift on their pickup, causing the semi to fall on Red and crush him. Sitting on the edge of the bridge beside their mangled pickup truck, Jeff and Amy embrace each other.

12064359 The film is presented as found footage from a personal video camera recovered by the United States Department of Defense. A disclaimer text states that the footage is of a case designated ""Cloverfield"" and was found in the area ""formerly known as Central Park"". The video consists chiefly of segments taped the night of Friday, May 22, 2009. The newer segments were taped over older video that is shown occasionally. The first video segment opens when Rob wakes up on the morning of Monday, April 27 having slept with Beth, a previously platonic friend. They make plans to go to Coney Island that day. The footage cuts to May 22, when Rob's brother Jason and his girlfriend Lily prepare a farewell party for Rob who will be moving to Japan. Their friend Hud uses the camera to film testimonials. After Beth leaves the party, an apparent earthquake strikes, and the city suffers a brief power outage. The local news reports that an oil tanker has capsized near Liberty Island. When the party-goers leave the building, they see the head of the Statue of Liberty crash into the street with several stunning scratch and bite marks. Hud records what appears to be a hand of a large creature several blocks away. The monster causes the Woolworth Building to collapse. Later, during the evacuation of the city, a gigantic tail destroys the Brooklyn Bridge, also killing Jason. News reports show the Army National Guard's 42nd Infantry Division attacking the monster and smaller ""parasite"" creatures falling off its body and attacking people.The creatures are called HSP or ""Human Scale Parasites"" in the Blu-ray special investigation mode.

The group rescues Beth, who was impaled on a piece of rebar. The four make their way to the evacuation site, where they encounter the monster once more over Grand Central Terminal. Lily is raced into one departing Marine Corps helicopter. Moments later, Rob, Beth and Hud are taken away in a second helicopter and witness a U.S. Air Force B-2 Spirit bomb the monster. The monster falls, then lunges at the helicopter, causing it to crash into Central Park.  The film skips to less than an hour later, with a voice on the crashed helicopter's radio warning that the Hammer Down protocol will begin in 15 minutes. The three friends regain consciousness and flee the helicopter. As they leave, the monster kills Hud. Rob and Beth grab the camera and take shelter under Greyshot Arch in Central Park as air raid sirens begin to blare and bombing starts. Rob and Beth take turns leaving their last testimonies of the day, which Rob mentions as Saturday, May 23. The bridge crumbles and debris covers the camera.According to the ""military intelligence"" in the special investigation mode of the Blu-ray version, this was the only thing that protected the camera during the Hammer Down protocol The film then cuts to the footage of Rob and Beth's Coney Island date on April 27. In the distance, unnoticed by Rob and Beth, a large object falls into the ocean.

384990Ann  lives in Baton Rouge. She is unhappily married to John  and has never experienced an orgasm. She is seeing a counselor for her problems. Graham Dalton  is an old college friend of John's. He is now a seeming drifter who, after nine years, returns to live in Baton Rouge. Graham arrives to find Ann, who has no idea that John has invited Graham to stay with them until he finds an apartment. When John arrives home, Graham's demeanor becomes remarkably more guarded, due in large part to John's overt disapproval of Graham's bohemian persona. They also discuss the fact that Graham's college girlfriend, Elizabeth, is also living in Baton Rouge. John is sleeping with Ann's sister, Cynthia , a free-spirited bartender. He rationalizes it by blaming Ann's frigidity. He frequently leaves his law office mid-day to meet with Cynthia, instructing his secretary to reschedule clients who are already in the lobby waiting to see him. Ann makes an impromptu visit to Graham's apartment, where she notices stacks of camcorder tapes around the television. When pressed, Graham explains that he interviews women about their sexual experiences and fantasies, on videotape. Ann, overcome with shock and confusion, flees his apartment. Within a day, Cynthia appears at Graham's apartment and introduces herself. Cynthia presses Graham to explain what ""spooked"" Ann the preceding day. Graham explains the videotapes, and admits to Cynthia his sexual dysfunction: that he is impotent when in the presence of another person, and that he achieves gratification by watching these videos in private. Graham propositions Cynthia to make a tape, assuring her that no other person is allowed to see the tapes. She believes him, and agrees. Cynthia reports back to Ann, who is horrified. Cynthia also tells John. When Ann discovers Cynthia's pearl earring in her bedroom, she is furious. She heads over to Graham's apartment with the intention of making a videotape. Graham objects, telling her it is something she would not do in a normal frame of mind. She insists and Graham relents. Afterward, Ann demands a divorce from John. In the ensuing argument, John gleans that Ann has been to Graham's, and that she made a video. He hits Graham and locks him out of the house, then watches Ann's tape. In it, Ann says she has never felt any kind of 'satisfaction' from sex. After Graham asks if she ever thinks of having sex with other men, she admits she has thought of Graham. Ann later turns the camera on Graham. Graham confesses that he is haunted by Elizabeth, and that his motivation in returning to Baton Rouge is a vague notion of reconnecting with her. He explains that he was a pathological liar, which destroyed an otherwise rewarding relationship with Elizabeth. He explains that he has since gone to great lengths to keep people at a distance and avoid relationships. Graham turns off the camera; it is implied that the two have sex. A chastened John joins Graham on the front patio and, with obvious pleasure, confesses to having sex with Elizabeth while she and Graham were a couple. Furious, Graham goes into a rage and destroys all of the tapes, as well as his camera. In the end, John is summoned to his boss's office, where it’s implied that he is about to be fired due to his frequent cancellations of meetings with important clients to have sexual trysts with Cynthia. In the next scene, Ann and Cynthia reconcile at the bar Cynthia tends before Ann returns home and joins Graham on the front porch, as they appear to be a couple.

The next shot is of the football match. Joe is very encouraging as a coach. The other team appears in white and black, which are the colours that Joe's team wears. Joe's team express their anger at this and respond by taking their shirts off so that they are able to distinguish between players. The other team scores the first goal of the game. Joe drives Liam home and tells Liam to take things one day at a time. Liam abruptly tells Joe to pull over and Liam runs up to a male who acts aggressively towards him. Joe does not hear what transpires between Liam and the man. Later, Joe sees Sarah, who is seen struggling with wallpaper in her car. Joe appears to fancy her, as Sarah tells him her name and he flirts with her. Joe then helps an acquaintance of Sarah's to complete a wall papering and paint job in Sarah's flat. Sarah then leaves the lads to it. She later brings them tea as they paint the ceiling and sing to themselves. They then look outside and notice someone taking photos of them through the window. Joe runs outside with his can of white paint and brush to confront the man who was taking the photos. The photographer tells Joe that he was just doing his job and that he has a bad heart. Joe then paints all over the photographer's car. The car speeds away and manages to knock over a pile of rubbish by the side of the road. Later, Sarah and Joe have dinner together. They are able to make comfortable conversation with one another. There is a bottle of red wine on the table, but Joe does not drink any of the alcohol. Sarah's telephone rings and she leaves the kitchen to answer it. Joe is then left alone with the wine. He clears his plate and appears somewhat nervous. When Sarah finishes with her telephone conversation, Joe asks her about the photographs on her wall. Joe later reveals to Sarah that he does not drink, to which Sarah replies: 'Why didn't you say?' Joe reveals that he is an alcoholic and he has not had a drink in ten months. Joe is happy that Sarah knows and that she has been direct in her responses to him. Joe thanks Sarah for her company. Sarah pays Joe for the work that he completed on her flat and they part company. Joe attends the Mayfield Health Centre. The practice is very busy and the receptionist tries to cope with a patient who is complaining because he has been waiting a long time in order to receive his prescription. Joe tells the receptionist that he would like to see Sarah. The receptionist does not appear to be surprised by his request and says that Joe is free to pop his head around the door. He sees Sarah advising parents on dealing with the changing of nappies. Outside the Health Centre, Joe asks Sarah if she would like to go ten-pin bowling with him and to ring him if she fancies going. They then part company. Sarah speaks with a female colleague, Maggie, and says that Joe seems a bit wild. She states that she is not going to go bowling with Joe. The next shot is of a bowling alley, with 'Spirit in the Sky' playing in the background. Sarah and Joe bowl together and laugh at their many errors. They occupy Aisle 16 and neither of them are spectacular players. They go back to Sarah's place where she asks him in for a cup of tea. Joe politely says no. Sarah offers him money for a taxi. A friendly argument ensues, at the end of which Sarah finds herself locked out of her flat. Sarah says that she can sleep in her car. Joe states that Sarah can sleep at his place, but not necessarily together. They arrive at Joe's and he shows her around his flat. While Joe makes tea for Sarah, she asks him if it is alright to put some music on. She puts on the same piece of music that the audience heard during the opening credits of the film, Beethoven's Violin Concerto in D Major. Joe tells Sarah that he used to be in a band and they won a local talent contest. Joe tells Sarah a story of how he was desperate for a drink one day and what transpired. He went to a music shop and stole some cassettes. He took one of them home and 'got pissed.' He describes the experience as being 'magical.' When Sarah asks him what made him stop drinking, Joe asks her why she wants to know. He is not hostile, but curious. Joe says that he is scared to tell her and that there is a strong chance that she will hate him if he tells. Joe explains that there was a girl he used to drink with and they loved one another. They were both 'just tangled up' and they used to get into terrible arguments and tear one another apart. The audience then sees a flashback where Joe and the girl are returning home from a night out. He states that 'a cloud just descended... really, really dark. And suddenly I hated her. I hated me.' He describes how he tried to open the door, but was unable to; when the partner whom he was with laughed at him, Joe lost control because she found it funny. He beat her by punching and kicking her, while she lay helpless on the ground. He screamed abuse at her. The next day, he had a blackout. Now, he remembers every punch and kick. He states how ashamed and disgusted he is with himself. He is obviously contrite and he has not yet forgiven himself for his actions. In the next shot, Sarah comforts Joe and tells him that it is okay. The next scene is of a football match. Joe sees three men beating up Liam. Joe attempts to intervene. He helps Liam up and asks him if he is still clean. Liam states that he is. Liam confronts his wife when she comes home. He suspects that she has been using and asks her if she 'takes him for a prick.' Liam then yells that he will leave her to rot, grabs her by her neck and forces her to look at herself in the mirror. Joe then attends Liam's flat and encounters Liam's wife shooting up in the bathroom. An argument erupts between them. Joe offers to help her. She does not want the kind of help that Joe offers. Joe then reluctantly assists her to tie off one of her veins so that she can shoot up. Joe tries to make sense of her incoherent mumbles as she lies prostrate in the bathtub. Joe then goes to a snooker club where he asks after Liam's whereabouts. Joe tells one of the men that he encounters that Liam has a four-year-old boy in an attempt to mitigate matters. Liam says that he does not want them to take liberties. He comes across Liam and is cross because Liam told him that he had stopped dealing. A tearful Liam confesses that he still owes money. Joe also tells Liam that he suspects that his wife is on the game. He is worried that people are going to break his legs. Joe and Sarah prepare a meal together, which is interrupted when they have sex. The next day, Joe goes to Stella Maris' B & B in order to deal with the matter of Liam. In a later scene, Joe gives Sarah a pair of earrings, as well as a ring. Joe tells Sarah that he loves her. Sarah tells him that she does not want it and Joe cannot understand what he has done wrong. Joe is confused as to why Sarah has behaved in this fashion. In the next shot, we see a copy of the Alcoholics Anonymous' small blue Bible as Joe listens to Beethoven's Violin Concerto in D Major and makes notes in a book. When Sarah arrives at his door, she apologises. They drink tea together and later embrace. Joe drives his van and his mates direct him to a place where they rob another van. At the outset, Joe does not know where they are going. Joe is shocked with his unwitting role in the robbery of Astral Sports. He still acts as the get-away driver. At the next football match, Joe cleverly remarks that the other team look like budgies because of their blue and yellow striped uniforms. Meanwhile, Sarah reveals to her co-worker Maggie that she is pregnant. Maggie congratulates her. At Sarah's flat, she expresses her reservations about Joe's dealings with Liam. Joe tells her that there are some things that she does not need to know. Joe outlines the limited choices that Liam faces, most of which are not pleasant. Sarah accuses Joe of being a drug dealer and asks where he got the money for her earrings and ring. Joe replies that the gang gave him some money. Sarah becomes enraged and asks, 'Are you going to hit me too, Joe?' Joe attends Liam's flat and states that Liam must deal with things himself. Joe returns to his flat with bottles of Smirnoff Vodka. He pours himself a drink, and takes a sip. Liam then goes to Joe's flat, where Joe is very inebriated. Joe does not understand why Liam has come to see him. Joe calls Liam a 'stupid wee prick.' The alcohol has overtaken Joe and he is hostile to Liam, who needs his help. As Liam witnesses members of the gang coming towards the premises, Liam realises that Joe has passed out and he kisses Joe on his forehead. Joe suddenly snaps awake and realises that Liam has taken his own life by hanging himself. The film concludes with Liam's funeral.
6189444Unlucky plumber – Athanasius Borshchov   and his friend Fedulov  spend all day and night avoiding work and finding opportunities to drink. Afonya takes ""kickbacks"" from clients and is often in trouble with the local committee for his behaviour. Afonya meets plasterer Kolya  in a pub, gets drunk and comes home. When his girlfriend sees the state he's in, she leaves him. The next morning he can't even remember yesterday's drinking companion. Things continue to go downhill for Afonya. When student interns from the vocational school are allocated to the plumbers, master ZHEK Vostryakovo  doesn't allocate any to him, fearing that he will not teach them well. Afonya begs for trainees and gets two. Having worked with him for one day and having seen his attitude and working methods, the trainees refuse to work with him anymore. The next day, Kolya arrives to live at Afonya's, having been thrown out of his house by his wife. At a dance Afonya meets young nurse Katya Snegireva , who knows about him through her brother, who used to play in Afonya's volleyball team. Afonya doesn't pay her much attention, because he's more interested in older women and already has his eye on one at the dance. However, a romantic walk with the older woman after the dance is over before it begins – Afonya is challenged to a fight by a hooligan, who he'd quarrelled with at the dance. The hooligan's friends join in, and finish the unequal fight. Katya worries for Afonya's safety, and calls the militia - which will only bring Anfonya to the committee's attention again. At a regular work call Borshchov meets Helen  and falls in love at first sight. He starts finding any excuse to work in her flat - even fooling a tenant, astronomer , by swapping his new Finnish sink for an old one, so he can install the Finnish sink in Helen's home as a gift. In his dreams Athos sees a family idyll with his wife Helen and their perfect children. Katya Snegireva, head over heels for Afonya, keeps engineering new meetings with him, and stops at nothing to attract his attention: ""Athanasius! someone called, I thought it was – you ... "". Afonya is completely oblivious to her feelings. Meanwhile Afonya's run in with the militia catches up with him and, for persistent drunkenness, truancy and fighting Afonya is threatened with being sacked at a meeting of the local committee. In addition, if he doesn't restore the Finnish sink he's definitely going to be fired. Afonya takes a porcelain sink with flowers to Helen to swap with the Finnish sink, but meets Helen coming home with company. She makes her feelings quite clear: she has her own life among fashionable and wealthy men, and Afonya is just a plumber. Afonya, depressed, goes to a restaurant with Fedulov and tries to escape into drunkenness, but it doesn't help. In his drunken state he goes to Katya Snegireva's home and proposes marriage, and wakes up next to her in the morning. Katya tells him she's due to move to Africa with work and wonders if she should cancel for Afonya. Afonya then decides to go back to his village, to his aunt Frosya , who brought him up. In the village, he meets his childhood friend Concertina  and, in a joyous moment sends the city a telegram resigning from his job and giving up his apartment. Only then does he learn that Aunt Frosya died two years ago. Afonya's depression increases – he has lost everything and has nowhere to go. Neighbour Uncle Yegor  gives Athos his Aunt Frosya's legacy – savings account in his name, the deeds to her house, and the letters she'd sent to herself, pretending they were from Afonya to the neighbours . The guilt of having ignored her only increases his gloom. Athanasius goes to the post office and tries to call Katya Snegireva on her memorable phone number 50-50-2, or as he says himself, ""rug-rug or two."" The answer comes back - Katya has left. Finally frustrated, he goes to the airport. He does not care where he's going or what will happen to him. Things have gotten so bad that a local militia man has to be convinced Afonya is the man in his passport photograph, so grim has he gotten since it was taken. Finally, just when Athanasius is heading to the AN-2 aircraft , a familiar girlish voice calls out. It's Katya, suitcase in hand: ""Athanasius!, someone called, I thought it was – you ... "

1273501Early in the Second World War, a raiding party of six Nazi sailors, caught ashore when their U-boat is sunk in Hudson Bay, attempt to evade capture by travelling across Canada to the still-neutral United States. The film's title comes from the 49th parallel north which marks part of the border between the two countries. Led by Lieutenants Hirth  and Kuhnecke , the small band of sailors encounter and sometimes brutalize a wide range of people, including the Eskimo Nick , the French-Canadian trapper , the floatplane crew and local Eskimo onlookers, pacifistic German Hutterite farmers, an innocent motorist, and the eccentric English academic and author ([[Leslie Howard . Making their way across Canada first using a stolen seaplane, the five surviving members of the Nazi band try to stir up sympathy among the Hutterite community outside Winnipeg, believing them to be countrymen. Lieutenant Hirth's stirring speech is rejected by Peter , the community's leader, and even by one of their own, Vogel , who comes to the aid of Anna . Vogel is tried by Lieutenant Hirth and summarily executed for the greater crime of trying to break away from the Nazi group. Hijacking an innocent motorist for his automobile, Hirth, Lohrmann and Kranz flee West. With all of Canada searching for them, and having killed 11 civilians along the way, Lohrmann is arrested by Canadian Mounties at a public gathering. Next, Kranz  is knocked out cold by writer Phillip A-Scott  in a cave - despite having been wounded. Finally, the story comes to a head with a confrontation on a freight train between Hirth, the sole remaining fugitive at large, and AWOL Canadian soldier Andy Brock . When Hirth learns the train has crossed into the United States, he surrenders his gun to a customs official and demands to be taken to the German embassy in the U.S. . However, Brock points out that Hirth is locked in the freight hold, but is not listed on the freight manifest, and convinces both American customs officials instead, that the freight car together with Hirth and Brock be sent back to Canada as ""improperly manifested cargo"" - which they readily comply with. The film ends with the train reversing to Canada and Brock about to pummel Hirth in the boxcar.

As a consequence for his report, the soldier has to fear for his life. Later, the perpetrators are convicted, although subsequent appeals reduce their sentences significantly. The plot takes place in a Bavarian forest and reenacts a real war crime that happened in the Vietnam war. The soldiers wear US uniforms, have authentic names but speak with a pronounced bavarian accent - a conscious directing decision known as Brechtian distancing effect.

13379536The book club is the brainchild of fiftysomething six-time divorcée Bernadette, who latches onto the idea when she meets Prudie, a prim, married high school French teacher in her mid-20s, at a Jane Austen film festival. Her concept is to have six members discuss all of Austen's six novels, with each member hosting the group once a month. Also inducted into the club are Sylvia, a fortysomething librarian who recently has separated from her philandering lawyer husband Daniel after more than two decades of marriage; Sylvia's 20-something lesbian daughter Allegra; Jocelyn, a happily unmarried control freak and breeder of Rhodesian Ridgebacks who has been Sylvia's friend since childhood; and Grigg, a science fiction fan who's roped into the group by Jocelyn with the hope he and Sylvia will prove to be a compatible match. As the months pass, each of the members develops characteristics similar to those of Austen's characters and reacts to events in their lives in much the same way their fictional counterparts would. Bernadette is the matriarch figure who longs to see everyone find happiness. Sylvia clings to her belief in steadfast love and devotion, and eventually reconciles with Daniel. Jocelyn denies her own feelings for Grigg while playing matchmaker for him and Sylvia. Prudie, encumbered with her inattentive husband Dean and a free-spirited, pot-smoking, aging-hippie mother, a product of the 1960s counterculture, finds herself desperately trying not to succumb to her feelings for her seductive student Trey. Allegra, who tends to meet her lovers while engaging in death-defying activities, feels betrayed when she discovers her current partner, aspiring writer Corinne, has used Allegra's life as the basis for her short stories. Grigg is attracted to Jocelyn and mystified by her seeming lack of interest in him, marked by her failure to read the Ursula K. Le Guin novels he has hoped will catch her fancy. He also serves as the comedic foil to Jocelyn and Prudie's very serious takes on the books.

1937542Living In Oblivion is divided into three parts, all of which concern the making of a low-budget movie featuring the same director, crew and substantially the same cast. Part one: Director Nick Reve  is shooting a low-budget independent film in the middle of New York City. The catering crew are under-funded and apathetic, deciding not to replace a carton of milk that has been on the craft service table for a week. The scene being shot is a difficult one: a young woman, Ellen, reproaches her elderly mother  for not intervening when the father beat Ellen as a child. However, on the set, just about everything that can go wrong does go wrong: shots are spoiled because of the mic boom is visible; the camera assistant fails to keep the shot in focus; Cora, the actress playing the mother, forgets her lines; and Nicole, the actress playing Ellen, becomes increasingly unfocused and careless. A dispirited Nick calls for a rehearsal without camera to refresh the actors. However, when Nicole  berates herself for acting badly, Cora  reassures her with a gesture that reminds Nicole of a similar gesture made by her own terminally ill mother. Nicole is so upset by the memory that she turns in an unexpectedly passionate performance; and Cora, startled by Nicole's sudden intensity, is equally good. Watching them, Nick becomes enthusiastic all over again. Unfortunately, it was not captured on film; cinematographer and camera operator Wolf , who has been diluting the sub-standard coffee with the spoiled milk, was vomiting in the toilet throughout. Nick ruefully calls for another take. This time, a sudden and insistent beeping sound distracts the actors. Nobody can tell where it's coming from; and Nick flies into a rage, berating everyone on the crew and cast for their inadequacies. He then wakes up in his own bed; the beeping sound was his own alarm clock. He has dreamed the entire segment. It is 4.30am; and he is due on set. Part two: Early the same morning, the film's lead actor Chad Palomino  is getting dressed in Nicole's hotel room. They have spent the night together, and Chad suggests that they might get together again later; Nicole politely declines. Chad and Nicole arrive on the set separately. Nicole's character Ellen and Chad's character Damian have been in love for years but have never admitted it until the scene being shot on this day. Shooting the scene is made practically impossible by Chad's irregular acting. He keeps changing his mind about where to stand and continually moves to places where he is either invisible or badly lit by scenic light. Nicole becomes increasingly frustrated by Chad's egomania; and, when he starts to stroke her head, she briefly loses her cool, then apologizes. An irritated Chad demands a private talk with Nick. He tells Nick that he has slept with Nicole and makes out that it was she, not he, who had wanted to continue the relationship. Desperate to keep Chad happy, Nick agrees that Nicole is not very good. Nicole overhears this conversation on the sound mixer's headphones. Pretending to be contrite, she asks Nick if they can improvise a little; but, when they do so, she announces to everyone that, although she slept with Chad, she is not at all interested in him. Chad loses his temper and quits the movie. Relieved that he will no longer have to please Chad, Nick calls him a ""Hostess Twinkie motherfucker"" and a fight breaks out. Nick beats Chad senseless and fires him. He apologises to Nicole and confesses that he loves her. They kiss—then Nicole abruptly wakes up, still in her bed, having dreamed the whole thing. Part three: Later the same day, the crew is setting up for a dream sequence in which Nicole, as Ellen, stands still while a dwarf walks around her holding an apple. Nick claims to have learned a lesson from his own dream: That sometimes, ""you just got to roll with things."" Nicole admits that she had a dream with Nick in it but doesn't tell him what happened. Nick manages to keep up his positive attitude despite the various mishaps that occur: The smoke machine fails to work, then it catches fire, then his senile mother Cora arrives on the set. However, the ill-tempered dwarf actor Tito  complains that the dream sequence is a cliché  and walks off the set in disgust. Nick's confidence collapses, and he announces that the movie is over. At that moment, his mother intervenes, grabbing the apple, moving to Tito's mark and announcing that she is ""ready"". The crew scrambles to shoot the scene, and her manic performance injects fresh energy and conviction into it. Nick is delighted and decides to keep the new dream sequence, and there is a tense moment while the sound mixer records 30 seconds of room tone. The entire cast and crew manages to remain silent, and they go on to shooting the next sequence.
31555231In flashback, Niall , a local news reporter, recalls visiting his mother's grave, as he smartens up in a toilet mirror. His colleague Tammy  knocks on the toilet door to hurry him up and as they walk to the car she instructs him on the art of the 'death-knock': knocking on the doors of the recently bereaved to obtain quotes and pictures of the deceased for the newspaper. Niall's poor track record has put his job on the line and Tammy has been detailed to improve his hit-rate. When they reach the house of Mrs Wright, who has lost her son in a car accident, Niall goes in first while Tammy waits outside. Before Niall can introduce himself and launch into his spiel that Tammy has prepared for him, Mrs Wright  interrupts him - ""I know who you are"" - and ushers him into the house. There she ropes him into unstacking the dishwasher as Niall tries in vain to broach the subject of the bereavement against the sound of a fire alarm which has been set off by the cigarette Mrs Wright is smoking. Mrs Wright appears baffled by Niall's requests for pictures and instead offers him some soup telling him they will look at some pictures ""in the morning"", much to Niall's surprise. She then leads him upstairs to the bedroom and encourages him to get some rest. Trapped in the bedroom, Niall examines the dead boy's belongings and finds himself playing with his toys. Meanwhile, Tammy waits outside taking a phone call from her boss at the newspaper, to whom she explains that Niall ""is still in there, so he must be doing alright"". Whilst playing with a light sabre, Niall knocks off a shelf-load of items and as he picks them up, he finds a photo of the dead boy. Mrs Wright, alerted by the noise, appears behind him and embracing Niall, she tells him: ""it's been a long day: time for bed."" Tammy knocks at the door and attempts to talk to Mrs Wright about the accident in which her son was killed, but Mrs Wright replies that her son is in his room and that there must be some mistake. Closing the door, she is nonetheless shaken by Tammy's insistence that her son is dead and she climbs the stairs to the bedroom where she finds Niall tucked up fast asleep in her son's bed. She kisses him on the cheek and switches out the light.
384141The story revolves around a farmer Shambu Mahato , who lives with his wife Parvati `Paro’  and son Kanhaiya  in a small village that has been hit badly by a famine. After years of drought, the region finally gets rain, leading to the farmers to rejoice. Shambu owns two bighas  of land, which is the only means of livelihood for the whole family. The local zamindar  Thakur Harnam Singh ([[Murad  partners with some city business men to construct a mill on his large parcel of land, which in return would profit them and bring prosperity to the village. The only problem is that in the middle of Harnam singh's land lay Shambu's meager two bighas of land. Harnam Singh is very confident that he could buy Shambu's land. Shambu has borrowed money from Harnam Singh several times in the past and has not paid back his debt. Harnam Singh calls for Shambu and proposes Shambu to sell his land to him in exchange for his debt. Shambu disagrees to sell his only livelihood and Harnam Singh gets upset. Harnam Singh orders him to pay back his debt by the next day or risk auctioning his land. Shambu comes back home to discuss the issue with his father, and with the help of his son, they figure out that the debt amounts to 65 rupees. Shambu wants to save his land by all means and sells all his household items including his wife's gold earrings. When Shambu meets Harman Singh's accountant to pay back his debt of 65 rupees, he's shocked to know that he actually owes 235 rupees. The accountant had forged the accounts and now refuses to consider the labor provided by Shambu's father Gangu as portion of debt payoff. The case goes to court and Shambu being an illiterate, has a tough time explaining to the judge how the accountant forged the numbers and how he took accountant's word of mouth and did not demand any receipt. Shambu loses the case, however the judge orders Shambu to pay back 235 rupees to Harnam Singh in three months. If Shambu is not able to pay back his debt, then his land would be auctioned off and the proceeds would go to pay off his debts. Shambu now struggles to get the money and he is unable to get a loan because he has no collaterals. One of his village friends gives him an idea to go to Calcutta  and try to get a job to earn enough money to pay off his debt. Shambu likes this idea, but faces resistance from his wife as she's pregnant and does not want to live away from him. Shambu persuades her that he'll be gone for three months only and it would benefit his family and the new born baby. Kanhaiya wants to join his father too, but Shambu refuses and scolds him. On the train to Calcutta, Shambu finds Kanhaiya hiding and hitchhiking with him and after a brief confrontation agrees to take Kanhaiya with him. In Calcutta, Shambu and Kanhaiya face a harsh welcome. Nobody is willing to talk with them, let alone help them. Kanhaiya befriends a street side shoe shiner named Lalu `Ustad’ . They hope for no prospective and even loose their last possessions while they are asleep on the street sides. Kanhaiya falls ill, and Shambu ends up renting a small room in the slums with the help of a tea vendor and the landlady's adopted grandchild rani. In order to pay the rent, Shambu works a coolie. Shambu befriends an old rickshaw-puller , who helps him to get a license as a rickshaw-puller.

Back in the village, Parvati and Gangu survive on eating water chestnuts picked up from the local river. She's seeks help from Bahu  to write letters to Shambu and stay in touch. As the three months end date nears by, Shambu becomes aggressive about earning and saving more money. One day, a man asks Shambu to chase another rickshaw that is carrying his girlfriend. Shambu is insisted to pull the rickshaw very fast for more money. The rickshaw loses a wheel and Shambu meets with an accident. Looking at the condition of his father, Kanhaiya joins a pick pocketer in order to earn quick money. Shambu gets mad and beats Kanhaiya when he comes to know about his dirty earnings. Meanwhile, Parvati gets worried since she receives no letters or money from Shambu and the Zamindar's accountant accuses Shambu that he has forgotten his family. She ends up working on a local construction site and gets devastated when she receives the news that Shambu has met with an accident. Finally, Parvati decides to visit Shambu in the city even though Gangu is on bed rest suffering of high fever. Parvati arrives in Calcutta, and is taken by a strange man, who claims he knows Shambu and will take her to him. He takes her to his shed and tries to steal and force her. She flees from him, but comes under a car. The crowd gathers around her and they call for a rickshaw to take her to the hospital. Shambu who was passing by offers a ride, and is shocked to see his injured wife. Meanwhile, Kanhaiya not able to withstand his father's condition steals money from a lady and runs back to the slum.

20841547Somewhere in Beverly Hills, in the house of Jack Benny , a mouse version of Jack is practicing his violin---off key---and saying to himself, ""Who is this guy Isaac Stern?""  Outside Jack's mouse hole, a cat is lying in wait, wearing ear muffs to filter out the discordant sound of Jack's violin. Jack calls his servant, Rochester  to get his white suit, which Rochester is wearing at the time. Jack tells the valet that his rental period is up  and he needs the suit because he is taking Mary Livingstone out for her birthday, and, true to character, is looking for a good cheap restaurant. While waiting for Mary, Jack decides to count his cheese in a basement vault. Using a coin on a string, he opens the lock, which appears to be a coin-operated lock from a pay toilet. As soon as he walks through the door, he takes a cane from a nail on the wall and starts humming We're in the Money. When he reaches the bottom of the stairs, he reaches through a hole and trips a razor blade hanging above the passageway like a guillotine. He then comes up to a derringer and uses the cane to trip the trigger on the derringer. Finally, he comes up to another hole, reaches through with the cane and trips a mousetrap. He then reaches the vault door, opens a combination lock, pulls the door open and numerous sound effects including various alarms, a foghorn and machine gun noises are heard. Ed, the vault guard, asks ""who goes there?"", and then an exchange is heard where Ed, apparently having been in the vault for a long time, asks ""did we win the war yet?"" When Benny assures Ed that the war had been won, thinking that Ed was referring to World War II, Ed says: ""That's good. What do you think we'll do with the Kaiser?"" Mary arrives while Jack is inspecting his cheese vault, and he emerges wondering who has been pilfering his gorgonzola. A fat rodent version of Don Wilson attempts to deliver a commercial when Jack advises him that this is a movie and not a television program. When Mary suggests a place, Jack's eyes ring up like an old cash register with a dollar sign  and ""no sale"", they discuss other options. As they were discussing the options, the cat writes a message extolling the ""Kit Kat Club""  and sends it to Jack as a paper airplane. Jack and Mary putter off in his Maxwell with Rochester behind the wheel until they reach the Kit Kat Club by following the arrows pointing to it. While enroute, Mary asks for champagne, while Jack says that he prefers a good ""mousecatel"". Unbeknownst to them, the ""club"" is actually the maw of a real cat, and as they enter, the cat's mouth closes on them. Jack cries: ""Help! Help!"" as the camera cuts to the live-action Jack Benny, who wakes up and, breaking the fourth wall, tells the audience: ""Gosh, what a crazy dream! Imagine- Mary and me as two little mice trapped inside a cat's mouth! And me playing the violin!"" At that point, Jack is interrupted by the sound of a discordant ""Rock-a-Bye Baby"" played on the violin, coming from within Jack's live-action cat. From there, the rodent versions of Jack and Mary emerge unharmed from the live-action cat. Following one last bit of animation , the real Jack Benny does one of his famous ""takes"" as the cartoon fades out.
1730420While driving cross-country from Boston to San Diego in their new Jeep Grand Cherokee, Jeff Taylor and his wife Amy narrowly miss colliding with a beat-up Ford F-150 that darts in front of them from an connecting road on a deserted highway. Later, while stopped at a gas station, the truck's driver, Earl, exchanges hostile words with Jeff before the couple resume their journey. Shortly afterwards, their Jeep breaks down in the middle of the desert. Leaving Jeff with the car, Amy accepts a ride from a passing big-rig trucker named Red Barr driving a Peterbilt 385, to get to a nearby diner and call for help. Jeff eventually discovers that the Jeep's battery connections have been suspiciously tampered with, and, after reconnecting them, drives to the diner, only to find that no one has seen his wife. When he catches up with Barr on the road and forces him to stop, the trucker claims he has never seen Jeff or his wife before. Jeff hails a passing sheriff, named Boyd, but a brief search of Barr's truck yields no sign of Amy, and he is let go. Jeff then goes to a police station where he is advised by a deputy to go back to the diner and wait for his wife. There Jeff meets with a simpleton mechanic named Billy, who says he saw Amy arrive in one truck and leave in another. He tells Jeff where they have taken her, but refuses to speak with the police, thinking that they are involved. Jeff heads to the location Billy mentioned, but is ambushed on a back road by Earl, and escapes by driving his Jeep into a river. Abandoning the Jeep and later circling back to watch his attackers salvage the Jeep from the water, Jeff is discovered and knocked out by Billy, an accomplice who had feigned mental impairment earlier. Jeff awakens in a car trunk surrounded by Earl, Billy, another accomplice, Al, a tow-truck driver, and their leader, Red Barr. Red tells Jeff that his wife will be released in exchange for $90,000 that the kidnappers think Jeff has in his bank account. Knowing that he only has a small fraction of the assumed amount, Jeff enters a nearby bank to withdraw what little money he has. After a failed attempt to alert the bank manager to his danger, Jeff steals marked money ribbons and a letter opener from the manager's desk; Jeff uses money ribbons to packet $1 bills in-between two $100 bills, fooling the kidnappers. With the ransom now in hand, Jeff is then instructed by phone to leave town, where he is picked up and bound with duct tape by Earl in his pickup truck. While gloating about how easy Jeff and his wife were to abduct by rigging their car to break down after leaving the gas station, as well as bragging that he intends to kill Jeff and his wife anyway, Earl discovers Jeff's ruse with the ransom. At exactly the same moment, Jeff frees himself and stabs Earl in the chest with the letter opener. After a struggle in the speeding, swerving pickup, Jeff takes over the vehicle, bounds Earl, and forces him to reveal his rendezvous with Red at a local truck stop. Sheriff Boyd appears in his patrol car and, seeing the swerving pickup, calls for backup and stops the vehicle. After Jeff exits the truck with Earl's pistol in hand, a stressed Boyd mistakes the situation and forces Jeff at gunpoint down onto the road. Earl frees himself and shoots Boyd with another pistol concealed in his boot. Just as Earl is about to shoot Jeff, a wounded Boyd shoots and kills Earl. Jeff uses Boyd's radio to call for an ambulance and heads to the truck stop Earl mentioned. At the rest stop, Jeff avoids the police looking for him in connection to the shooting of Boyd, and then spots Red talking on a payphone with another accomplice. Jeff follows Red to his truck where he jumps under the moving truck as Red drives away. Jeff loses his pistol while climbing aboard, but stows away to Red's farm at which he arrives early the next morning. Hiding in a barn, Jeff watches as Red and his remaining accomplices take a bound and gagged Amy and lock her in a freezer in the barn's cellar, leaving her to die. Unable to open the locked cellar door, Jeff finds a gun in Red's truck and uses it to hold Red, his accomplices, and his wife and son at gunpoint, demands the cellar key. Billy escapes, but Jeff forces the rest of the group to safely release Amy from the freezer before locking them in the cellar. Jeff and Amy then flee in a stolen Chevrolet C-20 pickup, while Billy frees Red and Al. They pursue the Taylors in their respective vehicles. During the climactic chase, Billy is killed in a fiery crash when Jeff forces his car off the road, while the trailer from Red's truck detaches, causing Al to violently crash into it. Undeterred, Red attempts to ram Jeff's vehicle off a bridge, trapping Amy's leg underneath the dashboard. Red's big rig nearly falls off the edge and becomes suspended by a steel bridge support. Jeff battles Red on the suspended big rig, eventually hurling Red to the rocks below. Jeff frees Amy from the dashboard in which she  pulls the automatic shift on their pickup, causing the semi to fall on Red and crush him. Sitting on the edge of the bridge beside their mangled pickup truck, Jeff and Amy embrace each other.

384990Ann  lives in Baton Rouge. She is unhappily married to John  and has never experienced an orgasm. She is seeing a counselor for her problems. Graham Dalton  is an old college friend of John's. He is now a seeming drifter who, after nine years, returns to live in Baton Rouge. Graham arrives to find Ann, who has no idea that John has invited Graham to stay with them until he finds an apartment. When John arrives home, Graham's demeanor becomes remarkably more guarded, due in large part to John's overt disapproval of Graham's bohemian persona. They also discuss the fact that Graham's college girlfriend, Elizabeth, is also living in Baton Rouge. John is sleeping with Ann's sister, Cynthia , a free-spirited bartender. He rationalizes it by blaming Ann's frigidity. He frequently leaves his law office mid-day to meet with Cynthia, instructing his secretary to reschedule clients who are already in the lobby waiting to see him. Ann makes an impromptu visit to Graham's apartment, where she notices stacks of camcorder tapes around the television. When pressed, Graham explains that he interviews women about their sexual experiences and fantasies, on videotape. Ann, overcome with shock and confusion, flees his apartment. Within a day, Cynthia appears at Graham's apartment and introduces herself. Cynthia presses Graham to explain what ""spooked"" Ann the preceding day. Graham explains the videotapes, and admits to Cynthia his sexual dysfunction: that he is impotent when in the presence of another person, and that he achieves gratification by watching these videos in private. Graham propositions Cynthia to make a tape, assuring her that no other person is allowed to see the tapes. She believes him, and agrees. Cynthia reports back to Ann, who is horrified. Cynthia also tells John. When Ann discovers Cynthia's pearl earring in her bedroom, she is furious. She heads over to Graham's apartment with the intention of making a videotape. Graham objects, telling her it is something she would not do in a normal frame of mind. She insists and Graham relents. Afterward, Ann demands a divorce from John. In the ensuing argument, John gleans that Ann has been to Graham's, and that she made a video. He hits Graham and locks him out of the house, then watches Ann's tape. In it, Ann says she has never felt any kind of 'satisfaction' from sex. After Graham asks if she ever thinks of having sex with other men, she admits she has thought of Graham. Ann later turns the camera on Graham. Graham confesses that he is haunted by Elizabeth, and that his motivation in returning to Baton Rouge is a vague notion of reconnecting with her. He explains that he was a pathological liar, which destroyed an otherwise rewarding relationship with Elizabeth. He explains that he has since gone to great lengths to keep people at a distance and avoid relationships. Graham turns off the camera; it is implied that the two have sex. A chastened John joins Graham on the front patio and, with obvious pleasure, confesses to having sex with Elizabeth while she and Graham were a couple. Furious, Graham goes into a rage and destroys all of the tapes, as well as his camera. In the end, John is summoned to his boss's office, where it’s implied that he is about to be fired due to his frequent cancellations of meetings with important clients to have sexual trysts with Cynthia. In the next scene, Ann and Cynthia reconcile at the bar Cynthia tends before Ann returns home and joins Graham on the front porch, as they appear to be a couple.

He feels that he is not in a position to drink anymore with safety. He tells the group that he copes by praying and states that he is grateful to be at the meeting. He receives a round of applause for his admissions. He goes round to his friend's place, bangs on the door and pretends to be the police. His friends soon realise that they have been tricked. They then travel in Joe's van where they examine stolen sporting merchandise which is of low quality. Joe and his friends stop at another person's house in order to pick up more people. A car cuts off the van. Joe later encounters the driver, whom Joe later describes as being 'the woman who tried to kill us all.' He exits his van and asks the woman if she lost her guide dog. The woman, Sarah, states that she is a health visitor. She wants to see Liam and his child, but Joe explains that Liam has an important football game to attend. The next shot is of the football match. Joe is very encouraging as a coach. The other team appears in white and black, which are the colours that Joe's team wears. Joe's team express their anger at this and respond by taking their shirts off so that they are able to distinguish between players. The other team scores the first goal of the game. Joe drives Liam home and tells Liam to take things one day at a time. Liam abruptly tells Joe to pull over and Liam runs up to a male who acts aggressively towards him. Joe does not hear what transpires between Liam and the man. Later, Joe sees Sarah, who is seen struggling with wallpaper in her car. Joe appears to fancy her, as Sarah tells him her name and he flirts with her. Joe then helps an acquaintance of Sarah's to complete a wall papering and paint job in Sarah's flat. Sarah then leaves the lads to it. She later brings them tea as they paint the ceiling and sing to themselves. They then look outside and notice someone taking photos of them through the window. Joe runs outside with his can of white paint and brush to confront the man who was taking the photos. The photographer tells Joe that he was just doing his job and that he has a bad heart. Joe then paints all over the photographer's car. The car speeds away and manages to knock over a pile of rubbish by the side of the road. Later, Sarah and Joe have dinner together. They are able to make comfortable conversation with one another. There is a bottle of red wine on the table, but Joe does not drink any of the alcohol. Sarah's telephone rings and she leaves the kitchen to answer it. Joe is then left alone with the wine. He clears his plate and appears somewhat nervous. When Sarah finishes with her telephone conversation, Joe asks her about the photographs on her wall. Joe later reveals to Sarah that he does not drink, to which Sarah replies: 'Why didn't you say?' Joe reveals that he is an alcoholic and he has not had a drink in ten months. Joe is happy that Sarah knows and that she has been direct in her responses to him. Joe thanks Sarah for her company. Sarah pays Joe for the work that he completed on her flat and they part company. Joe attends the Mayfield Health Centre. The practice is very busy and the receptionist tries to cope with a patient who is complaining because he has been waiting a long time in order to receive his prescription. Joe tells the receptionist that he would like to see Sarah. The receptionist does not appear to be surprised by his request and says that Joe is free to pop his head around the door. He sees Sarah advising parents on dealing with the changing of nappies. Outside the Health Centre, Joe asks Sarah if she would like to go ten-pin bowling with him and to ring him if she fancies going. They then part company. Sarah speaks with a female colleague, Maggie, and says that Joe seems a bit wild. She states that she is not going to go bowling with Joe. The next shot is of a bowling alley, with 'Spirit in the Sky' playing in the background. Sarah and Joe bowl together and laugh at their many errors. They occupy Aisle 16 and neither of them are spectacular players. They go back to Sarah's place where she asks him in for a cup of tea. Joe politely says no. Sarah offers him money for a taxi. A friendly argument ensues, at the end of which Sarah finds herself locked out of her flat. Sarah says that she can sleep in her car. Joe states that Sarah can sleep at his place, but not necessarily together. They arrive at Joe's and he shows her around his flat. While Joe makes tea for Sarah, she asks him if it is alright to put some music on. She puts on the same piece of music that the audience heard during the opening credits of the film, Beethoven's Violin Concerto in D Major. Joe tells Sarah that he used to be in a band and they won a local talent contest. Joe tells Sarah a story of how he was desperate for a drink one day and what transpired. He went to a music shop and stole some cassettes. He took one of them home and 'got pissed.' He describes the experience as being 'magical.' When Sarah asks him what made him stop drinking, Joe asks her why she wants to know. He is not hostile, but curious. Joe says that he is scared to tell her and that there is a strong chance that she will hate him if he tells. Joe explains that there was a girl he used to drink with and they loved one another. They were both 'just tangled up' and they used to get into terrible arguments and tear one another apart. The audience then sees a flashback where Joe and the girl are returning home from a night out. He states that 'a cloud just descended... really, really dark. And suddenly I hated her. I hated me.' He describes how he tried to open the door, but was unable to; when the partner whom he was with laughed at him, Joe lost control because she found it funny. He beat her by punching and kicking her, while she lay helpless on the ground. He screamed abuse at her. The next day, he had a blackout. Now, he remembers every punch and kick. He states how ashamed and disgusted he is with himself. He is obviously contrite and he has not yet forgiven himself for his actions. In the next shot, Sarah comforts Joe and tells him that it is okay. The next scene is of a football match. Joe sees three men beating up Liam. Joe attempts to intervene. He helps Liam up and asks him if he is still clean. Liam states that he is. Liam confronts his wife when she comes home. He suspects that she has been using and asks her if she 'takes him for a prick.' Liam then yells that he will leave her to rot, grabs her by her neck and forces her to look at herself in the mirror. Joe then attends Liam's flat and encounters Liam's wife shooting up in the bathroom. An argument erupts between them. Joe offers to help her. She does not want the kind of help that Joe offers. Joe then reluctantly assists her to tie off one of her veins so that she can shoot up. Joe tries to make sense of her incoherent mumbles as she lies prostrate in the bathtub. Joe then goes to a snooker club where he asks after Liam's whereabouts. Joe tells one of the men that he encounters that Liam has a four-year-old boy in an attempt to mitigate matters. Liam says that he does not want them to take liberties. He comes across Liam and is cross because Liam told him that he had stopped dealing. A tearful Liam confesses that he still owes money. Joe also tells Liam that he suspects that his wife is on the game. He is worried that people are going to break his legs. Joe and Sarah prepare a meal together, which is interrupted when they have sex. The next day, Joe goes to Stella Maris' B & B in order to deal with the matter of Liam. In a later scene, Joe gives Sarah a pair of earrings, as well as a ring. Joe tells Sarah that he loves her. Sarah tells him that she does not want it and Joe cannot understand what he has done wrong. Joe is confused as to why Sarah has behaved in this fashion. In the next shot, we see a copy of the Alcoholics Anonymous' small blue Bible as Joe listens to Beethoven's Violin Concerto in D Major and makes notes in a book. When Sarah arrives at his door, she apologises. They drink tea together and later embrace. Joe drives his van and his mates direct him to a place where they rob another van. At the outset, Joe does not know where they are going. Joe is shocked with his unwitting role in the robbery of Astral Sports. He still acts as the get-away driver. At the next football match, Joe cleverly remarks that the other team look like budgies because of their blue and yellow striped uniforms. Meanwhile, Sarah reveals to her co-worker Maggie that she is pregnant. Maggie congratulates her. At Sarah's flat, she expresses her reservations about Joe's dealings with Liam. Joe tells her that there are some things that she does not need to know. Joe outlines the limited choices that Liam faces, most of which are not pleasant. Sarah accuses Joe of being a drug dealer and asks where he got the money for her earrings and ring. Joe replies that the gang gave him some money. Sarah becomes enraged and asks, 'Are you going to hit me too, Joe?' Joe attends Liam's flat and states that Liam must deal with things himself. Joe returns to his flat with bottles of Smirnoff Vodka. He pours himself a drink, and takes a sip. Liam then goes to Joe's flat, where Joe is very inebriated. Joe does not understand why Liam has come to see him. Joe calls Liam a 'stupid wee prick.' The alcohol has overtaken Joe and he is hostile to Liam, who needs his help. As Liam witnesses members of the gang coming towards the premises, Liam realises that Joe has passed out and he kisses Joe on his forehead. Joe suddenly snaps awake and realises that Liam has taken his own life by hanging himself. The film concludes with Liam's funeral.
6189444Unlucky plumber – Athanasius Borshchov   and his friend Fedulov  spend all day and night avoiding work and finding opportunities to drink. Afonya takes ""kickbacks"" from clients and is often in trouble with the local committee for his behaviour. Afonya meets plasterer Kolya  in a pub, gets drunk and comes home. When his girlfriend sees the state he's in, she leaves him. The next morning he can't even remember yesterday's drinking companion. Things continue to go downhill for Afonya. When student interns from the vocational school are allocated to the plumbers, master ZHEK Vostryakovo  doesn't allocate any to him, fearing that he will not teach them well. Afonya begs for trainees and gets two. Having worked with him for one day and having seen his attitude and working methods, the trainees refuse to work with him anymore. The next day, Kolya arrives to live at Afonya's, having been thrown out of his house by his wife. At a dance Afonya meets young nurse Katya Snegireva , who knows about him through her brother, who used to play in Afonya's volleyball team. Afonya doesn't pay her much attention, because he's more interested in older women and already has his eye on one at the dance. However, a romantic walk with the older woman after the dance is over before it begins – Afonya is challenged to a fight by a hooligan, who he'd quarrelled with at the dance. The hooligan's friends join in, and finish the unequal fight. Katya worries for Afonya's safety, and calls the militia - which will only bring Anfonya to the committee's attention again. At a regular work call Borshchov meets Helen  and falls in love at first sight. He starts finding any excuse to work in her flat - even fooling a tenant, astronomer , by swapping his new Finnish sink for an old one, so he can install the Finnish sink in Helen's home as a gift. In his dreams Athos sees a family idyll with his wife Helen and their perfect children. Katya Snegireva, head over heels for Afonya, keeps engineering new meetings with him, and stops at nothing to attract his attention: ""Athanasius! someone called, I thought it was – you ... "". Afonya is completely oblivious to her feelings. Meanwhile Afonya's run in with the militia catches up with him and, for persistent drunkenness, truancy and fighting Afonya is threatened with being sacked at a meeting of the local committee. In addition, if he doesn't restore the Finnish sink he's definitely going to be fired. Afonya takes a porcelain sink with flowers to Helen to swap with the Finnish sink, but meets Helen coming home with company. She makes her feelings quite clear: she has her own life among fashionable and wealthy men, and Afonya is just a plumber. Afonya, depressed, goes to a restaurant with Fedulov and tries to escape into drunkenness, but it doesn't help. In his drunken state he goes to Katya Snegireva's home and proposes marriage, and wakes up next to her in the morning. Katya tells him she's due to move to Africa with work and wonders if she should cancel for Afonya. Afonya then decides to go back to his village, to his aunt Frosya , who brought him up. In the village, he meets his childhood friend Concertina  and, in a joyous moment sends the city a telegram resigning from his job and giving up his apartment. Only then does he learn that Aunt Frosya died two years ago. Afonya's depression increases – he has lost everything and has nowhere to go. Neighbour Uncle Yegor  gives Athos his Aunt Frosya's legacy – savings account in his name, the deeds to her house, and the letters she'd sent to herself, pretending they were from Afonya to the neighbours . The guilt of having ignored her only increases his gloom. Athanasius goes to the post office and tries to call Katya Snegireva on her memorable phone number 50-50-2, or as he says himself, ""rug-rug or two."" The answer comes back - Katya has left. Finally frustrated, he goes to the airport. He does not care where he's going or what will happen to him. Things have gotten so bad that a local militia man has to be convinced Afonya is the man in his passport photograph, so grim has he gotten since it was taken. Finally, just when Athanasius is heading to the AN-2 aircraft , a familiar girlish voice calls out. It's Katya, suitcase in hand: ""Athanasius!, someone called, I thought it was – you ... "

1273501Early in the Second World War, a raiding party of six Nazi sailors, caught ashore when their U-boat is sunk in Hudson Bay, attempt to evade capture by travelling across Canada to the still-neutral United States. The film's title comes from the 49th parallel north which marks part of the border between the two countries. Led by Lieutenants Hirth  and Kuhnecke , the small band of sailors encounter and sometimes brutalize a wide range of people, including the Eskimo Nick , the French-Canadian trapper , the floatplane crew and local Eskimo onlookers, pacifistic German Hutterite farmers, an innocent motorist, and the eccentric English academic and author ([[Leslie Howard . Making their way across Canada first using a stolen seaplane, the five surviving members of the Nazi band try to stir up sympathy among the Hutterite community outside Winnipeg, believing them to be countrymen. Lieutenant Hirth's stirring speech is rejected by Peter , the community's leader, and even by one of their own, Vogel , who comes to the aid of Anna . Vogel is tried by Lieutenant Hirth and summarily executed for the greater crime of trying to break away from the Nazi group. Hijacking an innocent motorist for his automobile, Hirth, Lohrmann and Kranz flee West. With all of Canada searching for them, and having killed 11 civilians along the way, Lohrmann is arrested by Canadian Mounties at a public gathering. Next, Kranz  is knocked out cold by writer Phillip A-Scott  in a cave - despite having been wounded. Finally, the story comes to a head with a confrontation on a freight train between Hirth, the sole remaining fugitive at large, and AWOL Canadian soldier Andy Brock . When Hirth learns the train has crossed into the United States, he surrenders his gun to a customs official and demands to be taken to the German embassy in the U.S. . However, Brock points out that Hirth is locked in the freight hold, but is not listed on the freight manifest, and convinces both American customs officials instead, that the freight car together with Hirth and Brock be sent back to Canada as ""improperly manifested cargo"" - which they readily comply with. The film ends with the train reversing to Canada and Brock about to pummel Hirth in the boxcar.

13379536The book club is the brainchild of fiftysomething six-time divorcée Bernadette, who latches onto the idea when she meets Prudie, a prim, married high school French teacher in her mid-20s, at a Jane Austen film festival. Her concept is to have six members discuss all of Austen's six novels, with each member hosting the group once a month. Also inducted into the club are Sylvia, a fortysomething librarian who recently has separated from her philandering lawyer husband Daniel after more than two decades of marriage; Sylvia's 20-something lesbian daughter Allegra; Jocelyn, a happily unmarried control freak and breeder of Rhodesian Ridgebacks who has been Sylvia's friend since childhood; and Grigg, a science fiction fan who's roped into the group by Jocelyn with the hope he and Sylvia will prove to be a compatible match. As the months pass, each of the members develops characteristics similar to those of Austen's characters and reacts to events in their lives in much the same way their fictional counterparts would. Bernadette is the matriarch figure who longs to see everyone find happiness. Sylvia clings to her belief in steadfast love and devotion, and eventually reconciles with Daniel. Jocelyn denies her own feelings for Grigg while playing matchmaker for him and Sylvia. Prudie, encumbered with her inattentive husband Dean and a free-spirited, pot-smoking, aging-hippie mother, a product of the 1960s counterculture, finds herself desperately trying not to succumb to her feelings for her seductive student Trey. Allegra, who tends to meet her lovers while engaging in death-defying activities, feels betrayed when she discovers her current partner, aspiring writer Corinne, has used Allegra's life as the basis for her short stories. Grigg is attracted to Jocelyn and mystified by her seeming lack of interest in him, marked by her failure to read the Ursula K. Le Guin novels he has hoped will catch her fancy. He also serves as the comedic foil to Jocelyn and Prudie's very serious takes on the books.

1937542Living In Oblivion is divided into three parts, all of which concern the making of a low-budget movie featuring the same director, crew and substantially the same cast. Part one: Director Nick Reve  is shooting a low-budget independent film in the middle of New York City. The catering crew are under-funded and apathetic, deciding not to replace a carton of milk that has been on the craft service table for a week. The scene being shot is a difficult one: a young woman, Ellen, reproaches her elderly mother  for not intervening when the father beat Ellen as a child. However, on the set, just about everything that can go wrong does go wrong: shots are spoiled because of the mic boom is visible; the camera assistant fails to keep the shot in focus; Cora, the actress playing the mother, forgets her lines; and Nicole, the actress playing Ellen, becomes increasingly unfocused and careless. A dispirited Nick calls for a rehearsal without camera to refresh the actors. However, when Nicole  berates herself for acting badly, Cora  reassures her with a gesture that reminds Nicole of a similar gesture made by her own terminally ill mother. Nicole is so upset by the memory that she turns in an unexpectedly passionate performance; and Cora, startled by Nicole's sudden intensity, is equally good. Watching them, Nick becomes enthusiastic all over again. Unfortunately, it was not captured on film; cinematographer and camera operator Wolf , who has been diluting the sub-standard coffee with the spoiled milk, was vomiting in the toilet throughout. Nick ruefully calls for another take. This time, a sudden and insistent beeping sound distracts the actors. Nobody can tell where it's coming from; and Nick flies into a rage, berating everyone on the crew and cast for their inadequacies. He then wakes up in his own bed; the beeping sound was his own alarm clock. He has dreamed the entire segment. It is 4.30am; and he is due on set. Part two: Early the same morning, the film's lead actor Chad Palomino  is getting dressed in Nicole's hotel room. They have spent the night together, and Chad suggests that they might get together again later; Nicole politely declines. Chad and Nicole arrive on the set separately. Nicole's character Ellen and Chad's character Damian have been in love for years but have never admitted it until the scene being shot on this day. Shooting the scene is made practically impossible by Chad's irregular acting. He keeps changing his mind about where to stand and continually moves to places where he is either invisible or badly lit by scenic light. Nicole becomes increasingly frustrated by Chad's egomania; and, when he starts to stroke her head, she briefly loses her cool, then apologizes. An irritated Chad demands a private talk with Nick. He tells Nick that he has slept with Nicole and makes out that it was she, not he, who had wanted to continue the relationship. Desperate to keep Chad happy, Nick agrees that Nicole is not very good. Nicole overhears this conversation on the sound mixer's headphones. Pretending to be contrite, she asks Nick if they can improvise a little; but, when they do so, she announces to everyone that, although she slept with Chad, she is not at all interested in him. Chad loses his temper and quits the movie. Relieved that he will no longer have to please Chad, Nick calls him a ""Hostess Twinkie motherfucker"" and a fight breaks out. Nick beats Chad senseless and fires him. He apologises to Nicole and confesses that he loves her. They kiss—then Nicole abruptly wakes up, still in her bed, having dreamed the whole thing. Part three: Later the same day, the crew is setting up for a dream sequence in which Nicole, as Ellen, stands still while a dwarf walks around her holding an apple. Nick claims to have learned a lesson from his own dream: That sometimes, ""you just got to roll with things."" Nicole admits that she had a dream with Nick in it but doesn't tell him what happened. Nick manages to keep up his positive attitude despite the various mishaps that occur: The smoke machine fails to work, then it catches fire, then his senile mother Cora arrives on the set. However, the ill-tempered dwarf actor Tito  complains that the dream sequence is a cliché  and walks off the set in disgust. Nick's confidence collapses, and he announces that the movie is over. At that moment, his mother intervenes, grabbing the apple, moving to Tito's mark and announcing that she is ""ready"". The crew scrambles to shoot the scene, and her manic performance injects fresh energy and conviction into it. Nick is delighted and decides to keep the new dream sequence, and there is a tense moment while the sound mixer records 30 seconds of room tone. The entire cast and crew manages to remain silent, and they go on to shooting the next sequence.
31555231In flashback, Niall , a local news reporter, recalls visiting his mother's grave, as he smartens up in a toilet mirror. His colleague Tammy  knocks on the toilet door to hurry him up and as they walk to the car she instructs him on the art of the 'death-knock': knocking on the doors of the recently bereaved to obtain quotes and pictures of the deceased for the newspaper. Niall's poor track record has put his job on the line and Tammy has been detailed to improve his hit-rate. When they reach the house of Mrs Wright, who has lost her son in a car accident, Niall goes in first while Tammy waits outside. Before Niall can introduce himself and launch into his spiel that Tammy has prepared for him, Mrs Wright  interrupts him - ""I know who you are"" - and ushers him into the house. There she ropes him into unstacking the dishwasher as Niall tries in vain to broach the subject of the bereavement against the sound of a fire alarm which has been set off by the cigarette Mrs Wright is smoking. Mrs Wright appears baffled by Niall's requests for pictures and instead offers him some soup telling him they will look at some pictures ""in the morning"", much to Niall's surprise. She then leads him upstairs to the bedroom and encourages him to get some rest. Trapped in the bedroom, Niall examines the dead boy's belongings and finds himself playing with his toys. Meanwhile, Tammy waits outside taking a phone call from her boss at the newspaper, to whom she explains that Niall ""is still in there, so he must be doing alright"". Whilst playing with a light sabre, Niall knocks off a shelf-load of items and as he picks them up, he finds a photo of the dead boy. Mrs Wright, alerted by the noise, appears behind him and embracing Niall, she tells him: ""it's been a long day: time for bed."" Tammy knocks at the door and attempts to talk to Mrs Wright about the accident in which her son was killed, but Mrs Wright replies that her son is in his room and that there must be some mistake. Closing the door, she is nonetheless shaken by Tammy's insistence that her son is dead and she climbs the stairs to the bedroom where she finds Niall tucked up fast asleep in her son's bed. She kisses him on the cheek and switches out the light.

The case goes to court and Shambu being an illiterate, has a tough time explaining to the judge how the accountant forged the numbers and how he took accountant's word of mouth and did not demand any receipt. Shambu loses the case, however the judge orders Shambu to pay back 235 rupees to Harnam Singh in three months. If Shambu is not able to pay back his debt, then his land would be auctioned off and the proceeds would go to pay off his debts. Shambu now struggles to get the money and he is unable to get a loan because he has no collaterals. One of his village friends gives him an idea to go to Calcutta  and try to get a job to earn enough money to pay off his debt. Shambu likes this idea, but faces resistance from his wife as she's pregnant and does not want to live away from him. Shambu persuades her that he'll be gone for three months only and it would benefit his family and the new born baby. Kanhaiya wants to join his father too, but Shambu refuses and scolds him. On the train to Calcutta, Shambu finds Kanhaiya hiding and hitchhiking with him and after a brief confrontation agrees to take Kanhaiya with him. In Calcutta, Shambu and Kanhaiya face a harsh welcome. Nobody is willing to talk with them, let alone help them. Kanhaiya befriends a street side shoe shiner named Lalu `Ustad’ . They hope for no prospective and even loose their last possessions while they are asleep on the street sides. Kanhaiya falls ill, and Shambu ends up renting a small room in the slums with the help of a tea vendor and the landlady's adopted grandchild rani. In order to pay the rent, Shambu works a coolie. Shambu befriends an old rickshaw-puller , who helps him to get a license as a rickshaw-puller. Kanhaiya tries to help his family by taking up shoe shining with the help of old rickshaw-puller and Lalu `Ustad’. Back in the village, Parvati and Gangu survive on eating water chestnuts picked up from the local river. She's seeks help from Bahu  to write letters to Shambu and stay in touch. As the three months end date nears by, Shambu becomes aggressive about earning and saving more money. One day, a man asks Shambu to chase another rickshaw that is carrying his girlfriend. Shambu is insisted to pull the rickshaw very fast for more money. The rickshaw loses a wheel and Shambu meets with an accident. Looking at the condition of his father, Kanhaiya joins a pick pocketer in order to earn quick money. Shambu gets mad and beats Kanhaiya when he comes to know about his dirty earnings. Meanwhile, Parvati gets worried since she receives no letters or money from Shambu and the Zamindar's accountant accuses Shambu that he has forgotten his family. She ends up working on a local construction site and gets devastated when she receives the news that Shambu has met with an accident. Finally, Parvati decides to visit Shambu in the city even though Gangu is on bed rest suffering of high fever. Parvati arrives in Calcutta, and is taken by a strange man, who claims he knows Shambu and will take her to him. He takes her to his shed and tries to steal and force her. She flees from him, but comes under a car. The crowd gathers around her and they call for a rickshaw to take her to the hospital. Shambu who was passing by offers a ride, and is shocked to see his injured wife. Meanwhile, Kanhaiya not able to withstand his father's condition steals money from a lady and runs back to the slum. He comes to know about his mother's condition and rushes to the hospital. He cries after seeing his injured mother and claims that God has punished them because he started stealing money. He rips the money into pieces. The doctors tell Shambu that he has to spend money on medicine and blood in order to save his wife. Poor Shambu has no choice but so spend all his earnings to save his wife. Back in the village the land is auctioned because Shambu fails to pay back the debt and Gangu develops a mental disorder. The land is now owned by Harman Singh and the mill construction has begun. Shambu and his family come back to the village only to see their land sold and a factory being constructed over it. He then tries to get a handful of dirt from his land, but is stopped and forced to throw away by a security guard. The film ends as Shambu and his family walks away from their land.
20841547Somewhere in Beverly Hills, in the house of Jack Benny , a mouse version of Jack is practicing his violin---off key---and saying to himself, ""Who is this guy Isaac Stern?""  Outside Jack's mouse hole, a cat is lying in wait, wearing ear muffs to filter out the discordant sound of Jack's violin. Jack calls his servant, Rochester  to get his white suit, which Rochester is wearing at the time. Jack tells the valet that his rental period is up  and he needs the suit because he is taking Mary Livingstone out for her birthday, and, true to character, is looking for a good cheap restaurant. While waiting for Mary, Jack decides to count his cheese in a basement vault. Using a coin on a string, he opens the lock, which appears to be a coin-operated lock from a pay toilet. As soon as he walks through the door, he takes a cane from a nail on the wall and starts humming We're in the Money. When he reaches the bottom of the stairs, he reaches through a hole and trips a razor blade hanging above the passageway like a guillotine. He then comes up to a derringer and uses the cane to trip the trigger on the derringer. Finally, he comes up to another hole, reaches through with the cane and trips a mousetrap. He then reaches the vault door, opens a combination lock, pulls the door open and numerous sound effects including various alarms, a foghorn and machine gun noises are heard. Ed, the vault guard, asks ""who goes there?"", and then an exchange is heard where Ed, apparently having been in the vault for a long time, asks ""did we win the war yet?"" When Benny assures Ed that the war had been won, thinking that Ed was referring to World War II, Ed says: ""That's good. What do you think we'll do with the Kaiser?"" Mary arrives while Jack is inspecting his cheese vault, and he emerges wondering who has been pilfering his gorgonzola. A fat rodent version of Don Wilson attempts to deliver a commercial when Jack advises him that this is a movie and not a television program. When Mary suggests a place, Jack's eyes ring up like an old cash register with a dollar sign  and ""no sale"", they discuss other options. As they were discussing the options, the cat writes a message extolling the ""Kit Kat Club""  and sends it to Jack as a paper airplane. Jack and Mary putter off in his Maxwell with Rochester behind the wheel until they reach the Kit Kat Club by following the arrows pointing to it. While enroute, Mary asks for champagne, while Jack says that he prefers a good ""mousecatel"". Unbeknownst to them, the ""club"" is actually the maw of a real cat, and as they enter, the cat's mouth closes on them. Jack cries: ""Help! Help!"" as the camera cuts to the live-action Jack Benny, who wakes up and, breaking the fourth wall, tells the audience: ""Gosh, what a crazy dream! Imagine- Mary and me as two little mice trapped inside a cat's mouth! And me playing the violin!"" At that point, Jack is interrupted by the sound of a discordant ""Rock-a-Bye Baby"" played on the violin, coming from within Jack's live-action cat. From there, the rodent versions of Jack and Mary emerge unharmed from the live-action cat. Following one last bit of animation , the real Jack Benny does one of his famous ""takes"" as the cartoon fades out.
1730420While driving cross-country from Boston to San Diego in their new Jeep Grand Cherokee, Jeff Taylor and his wife Amy narrowly miss colliding with a beat-up Ford F-150 that darts in front of them from an connecting road on a deserted highway. Later, while stopped at a gas station, the truck's driver, Earl, exchanges hostile words with Jeff before the couple resume their journey. Shortly afterwards, their Jeep breaks down in the middle of the desert. Leaving Jeff with the car, Amy accepts a ride from a passing big-rig trucker named Red Barr driving a Peterbilt 385, to get to a nearby diner and call for help. Jeff eventually discovers that the Jeep's battery connections have been suspiciously tampered with, and, after reconnecting them, drives to the diner, only to find that no one has seen his wife. When he catches up with Barr on the road and forces him to stop, the trucker claims he has never seen Jeff or his wife before. Jeff hails a passing sheriff, named Boyd, but a brief search of Barr's truck yields no sign of Amy, and he is let go. Jeff then goes to a police station where he is advised by a deputy to go back to the diner and wait for his wife. There Jeff meets with a simpleton mechanic named Billy, who says he saw Amy arrive in one truck and leave in another. He tells Jeff where they have taken her, but refuses to speak with the police, thinking that they are involved. Jeff heads to the location Billy mentioned, but is ambushed on a back road by Earl, and escapes by driving his Jeep into a river. Abandoning the Jeep and later circling back to watch his attackers salvage the Jeep from the water, Jeff is discovered and knocked out by Billy, an accomplice who had feigned mental impairment earlier. Jeff awakens in a car trunk surrounded by Earl, Billy, another accomplice, Al, a tow-truck driver, and their leader, Red Barr. Red tells Jeff that his wife will be released in exchange for $90,000 that the kidnappers think Jeff has in his bank account. Knowing that he only has a small fraction of the assumed amount, Jeff enters a nearby bank to withdraw what little money he has. After a failed attempt to alert the bank manager to his danger, Jeff steals marked money ribbons and a letter opener from the manager's desk; Jeff uses money ribbons to packet $1 bills in-between two $100 bills, fooling the kidnappers. With the ransom now in hand, Jeff is then instructed by phone to leave town, where he is picked up and bound with duct tape by Earl in his pickup truck. While gloating about how easy Jeff and his wife were to abduct by rigging their car to break down after leaving the gas station, as well as bragging that he intends to kill Jeff and his wife anyway, Earl discovers Jeff's ruse with the ransom. At exactly the same moment, Jeff frees himself and stabs Earl in the chest with the letter opener. After a struggle in the speeding, swerving pickup, Jeff takes over the vehicle, bounds Earl, and forces him to reveal his rendezvous with Red at a local truck stop. Sheriff Boyd appears in his patrol car and, seeing the swerving pickup, calls for backup and stops the vehicle. After Jeff exits the truck with Earl's pistol in hand, a stressed Boyd mistakes the situation and forces Jeff at gunpoint down onto the road. Earl frees himself and shoots Boyd with another pistol concealed in his boot. Just as Earl is about to shoot Jeff, a wounded Boyd shoots and kills Earl. Jeff uses Boyd's radio to call for an ambulance and heads to the truck stop Earl mentioned. At the rest stop, Jeff avoids the police looking for him in connection to the shooting of Boyd, and then spots Red talking on a payphone with another accomplice. Jeff follows Red to his truck where he jumps under the moving truck as Red drives away. Jeff loses his pistol while climbing aboard, but stows away to Red's farm at which he arrives early the next morning. Hiding in a barn, Jeff watches as Red and his remaining accomplices take a bound and gagged Amy and lock her in a freezer in the barn's cellar, leaving her to die. Unable to open the locked cellar door, Jeff finds a gun in Red's truck and uses it to hold Red, his accomplices, and his wife and son at gunpoint, demands the cellar key. Billy escapes, but Jeff forces the rest of the group to safely release Amy from the freezer before locking them in the cellar. Jeff and Amy then flee in a stolen Chevrolet C-20 pickup, while Billy frees Red and Al. They pursue the Taylors in their respective vehicles. During the climactic chase, Billy is killed in a fiery crash when Jeff forces his car off the road, while the trailer from Red's truck detaches, causing Al to violently crash into it. Undeterred, Red attempts to ram Jeff's vehicle off a bridge, trapping Amy's leg underneath the dashboard. Red's big rig nearly falls off the edge and becomes suspended by a steel bridge support. Jeff battles Red on the suspended big rig, eventually hurling Red to the rocks below. Jeff frees Amy from the dashboard in which she  pulls the automatic shift on their pickup, causing the semi to fall on Red and crush him. Sitting on the edge of the bridge beside their mangled pickup truck, Jeff and Amy embrace each other.

12064359 The film is presented as found footage from a personal video camera recovered by the United States Department of Defense. A disclaimer text states that the footage is of a case designated ""Cloverfield"" and was found in the area ""formerly known as Central Park"". The video consists chiefly of segments taped the night of Friday, May 22, 2009. The newer segments were taped over older video that is shown occasionally. The first video segment opens when Rob wakes up on the morning of Monday, April 27 having slept with Beth, a previously platonic friend. They make plans to go to Coney Island that day. The footage cuts to May 22, when Rob's brother Jason and his girlfriend Lily prepare a farewell party for Rob who will be moving to Japan. Their friend Hud uses the camera to film testimonials. After Beth leaves the party, an apparent earthquake strikes, and the city suffers a brief power outage. The local news reports that an oil tanker has capsized near Liberty Island. When the party-goers leave the building, they see the head of the Statue of Liberty crash into the street with several stunning scratch and bite marks. Hud records what appears to be a hand of a large creature several blocks away. The monster causes the Woolworth Building to collapse. Later, during the evacuation of the city, a gigantic tail destroys the Brooklyn Bridge, also killing Jason. News reports show the Army National Guard's 42nd Infantry Division attacking the monster and smaller ""parasite"" creatures falling off its body and attacking people.The creatures are called HSP or ""Human Scale Parasites"" in the Blu-ray special investigation mode. Rob listens to a phone message from Beth saying she is trapped in her apartment and unable to move. Going against the crowd, Rob, Hud, Lily, and Marlena  venture to Midtown Manhattan to rescue Beth.

One of the military leaders tells the group when the last evacuation helicopter will depart before the military executes its ""Hammer Down Protocol"", which will destroy Manhattan. The group rescues Beth, who was impaled on a piece of rebar. The four make their way to the evacuation site, where they encounter the monster once more over Grand Central Terminal. Lily is raced into one departing Marine Corps helicopter. Moments later, Rob, Beth and Hud are taken away in a second helicopter and witness a U.S. Air Force B-2 Spirit bomb the monster. The monster falls, then lunges at the helicopter, causing it to crash into Central Park.  The film skips to less than an hour later, with a voice on the crashed helicopter's radio warning that the Hammer Down protocol will begin in 15 minutes. The three friends regain consciousness and flee the helicopter. As they leave, the monster kills Hud. Rob and Beth grab the camera and take shelter under Greyshot Arch in Central Park as air raid sirens begin to blare and bombing starts. Rob and Beth take turns leaving their last testimonies of the day, which Rob mentions as Saturday, May 23. The bridge crumbles and debris covers the camera.According to the ""military intelligence"" in the special investigation mode of the Blu-ray version, this was the only thing that protected the camera during the Hammer Down protocol The film then cuts to the footage of Rob and Beth's Coney Island date on April 27. In the distance, unnoticed by Rob and Beth, a large object falls into the ocean.

384990Ann  lives in Baton Rouge. She is unhappily married to John  and has never experienced an orgasm. She is seeing a counselor for her problems. Graham Dalton  is an old college friend of John's. He is now a seeming drifter who, after nine years, returns to live in Baton Rouge. Graham arrives to find Ann, who has no idea that John has invited Graham to stay with them until he finds an apartment. When John arrives home, Graham's demeanor becomes remarkably more guarded, due in large part to John's overt disapproval of Graham's bohemian persona. They also discuss the fact that Graham's college girlfriend, Elizabeth, is also living in Baton Rouge. John is sleeping with Ann's sister, Cynthia , a free-spirited bartender. He rationalizes it by blaming Ann's frigidity. He frequently leaves his law office mid-day to meet with Cynthia, instructing his secretary to reschedule clients who are already in the lobby waiting to see him. Ann makes an impromptu visit to Graham's apartment, where she notices stacks of camcorder tapes around the television. When pressed, Graham explains that he interviews women about their sexual experiences and fantasies, on videotape. Ann, overcome with shock and confusion, flees his apartment. Within a day, Cynthia appears at Graham's apartment and introduces herself. Cynthia presses Graham to explain what ""spooked"" Ann the preceding day. Graham explains the videotapes, and admits to Cynthia his sexual dysfunction: that he is impotent when in the presence of another person, and that he achieves gratification by watching these videos in private. Graham propositions Cynthia to make a tape, assuring her that no other person is allowed to see the tapes. She believes him, and agrees. Cynthia reports back to Ann, who is horrified. Cynthia also tells John. When Ann discovers Cynthia's pearl earring in her bedroom, she is furious. She heads over to Graham's apartment with the intention of making a videotape. Graham objects, telling her it is something she would not do in a normal frame of mind. She insists and Graham relents. Afterward, Ann demands a divorce from John. In the ensuing argument, John gleans that Ann has been to Graham's, and that she made a video. He hits Graham and locks him out of the house, then watches Ann's tape. In it, Ann says she has never felt any kind of 'satisfaction' from sex. After Graham asks if she ever thinks of having sex with other men, she admits she has thought of Graham. Ann later turns the camera on Graham. Graham confesses that he is haunted by Elizabeth, and that his motivation in returning to Baton Rouge is a vague notion of reconnecting with her. He explains that he was a pathological liar, which destroyed an otherwise rewarding relationship with Elizabeth. He explains that he has since gone to great lengths to keep people at a distance and avoid relationships. Graham turns off the camera; it is implied that the two have sex. A chastened John joins Graham on the front patio and, with obvious pleasure, confesses to having sex with Elizabeth while she and Graham were a couple. Furious, Graham goes into a rage and destroys all of the tapes, as well as his camera. In the end, John is summoned to his boss's office, where it’s implied that he is about to be fired due to his frequent cancellations of meetings with important clients to have sexual trysts with Cynthia. In the next scene, Ann and Cynthia reconcile at the bar Cynthia tends before Ann returns home and joins Graham on the front porch, as they appear to be a couple.
1430058The film begins with Joe Kavanagh at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, relaying an experience from his past. He states the ritualised greeting: 'My name is Joe and I'm an alcoholic.' He feels that he is not in a position to drink anymore with safety. He tells the group that he copes by praying and states that he is grateful to be at the meeting. He receives a round of applause for his admissions. He goes round to his friend's place, bangs on the door and pretends to be the police. His friends soon realise that they have been tricked. They then travel in Joe's van where they examine stolen sporting merchandise which is of low quality. Joe and his friends stop at another person's house in order to pick up more people. A car cuts off the van. Joe later encounters the driver, whom Joe later describes as being 'the woman who tried to kill us all.' He exits his van and asks the woman if she lost her guide dog. The woman, Sarah, states that she is a health visitor. She wants to see Liam and his child, but Joe explains that Liam has an important football game to attend. The next shot is of the football match. Joe is very encouraging as a coach. The other team appears in white and black, which are the colours that Joe's team wears. Joe's team express their anger at this and respond by taking their shirts off so that they are able to distinguish between players. The other team scores the first goal of the game. Joe drives Liam home and tells Liam to take things one day at a time. Liam abruptly tells Joe to pull over and Liam runs up to a male who acts aggressively towards him. Joe does not hear what transpires between Liam and the man. Later, Joe sees Sarah, who is seen struggling with wallpaper in her car. Joe appears to fancy her, as Sarah tells him her name and he flirts with her. Joe then helps an acquaintance of Sarah's to complete a wall papering and paint job in Sarah's flat. Sarah then leaves the lads to it. She later brings them tea as they paint the ceiling and sing to themselves. They then look outside and notice someone taking photos of them through the window. Joe runs outside with his can of white paint and brush to confront the man who was taking the photos. The photographer tells Joe that he was just doing his job and that he has a bad heart. Joe then paints all over the photographer's car. The car speeds away and manages to knock over a pile of rubbish by the side of the road. Later, Sarah and Joe have dinner together. They are able to make comfortable conversation with one another. There is a bottle of red wine on the table, but Joe does not drink any of the alcohol. Sarah's telephone rings and she leaves the kitchen to answer it. Joe is then left alone with the wine. He clears his plate and appears somewhat nervous. When Sarah finishes with her telephone conversation, Joe asks her about the photographs on her wall. Joe later reveals to Sarah that he does not drink, to which Sarah replies: 'Why didn't you say?' Joe reveals that he is an alcoholic and he has not had a drink in ten months. Joe is happy that Sarah knows and that she has been direct in her responses to him. Joe thanks Sarah for her company. Sarah pays Joe for the work that he completed on her flat and they part company. Joe attends the Mayfield Health Centre. The practice is very busy and the receptionist tries to cope with a patient who is complaining because he has been waiting a long time in order to receive his prescription. Joe tells the receptionist that he would like to see Sarah. The receptionist does not appear to be surprised by his request and says that Joe is free to pop his head around the door. He sees Sarah advising parents on dealing with the changing of nappies. Outside the Health Centre, Joe asks Sarah if she would like to go ten-pin bowling with him and to ring him if she fancies going. They then part company. Sarah speaks with a female colleague, Maggie, and says that Joe seems a bit wild. She states that she is not going to go bowling with Joe. The next shot is of a bowling alley, with 'Spirit in the Sky' playing in the background. Sarah and Joe bowl together and laugh at their many errors. They occupy Aisle 16 and neither of them are spectacular players. They go back to Sarah's place where she asks him in for a cup of tea. Joe politely says no. Sarah offers him money for a taxi. A friendly argument ensues, at the end of which Sarah finds herself locked out of her flat. Sarah says that she can sleep in her car. Joe states that Sarah can sleep at his place, but not necessarily together. They arrive at Joe's and he shows her around his flat. While Joe makes tea for Sarah, she asks him if it is alright to put some music on. She puts on the same piece of music that the audience heard during the opening credits of the film, Beethoven's Violin Concerto in D Major. Joe tells Sarah that he used to be in a band and they won a local talent contest. Joe tells Sarah a story of how he was desperate for a drink one day and what transpired. He went to a music shop and stole some cassettes. He took one of them home and 'got pissed.' He describes the experience as being 'magical.' When Sarah asks him what made him stop drinking, Joe asks her why she wants to know. He is not hostile, but curious. Joe says that he is scared to tell her and that there is a strong chance that she will hate him if he tells. Joe explains that there was a girl he used to drink with and they loved one another. They were both 'just tangled up' and they used to get into terrible arguments and tear one another apart. The audience then sees a flashback where Joe and the girl are returning home from a night out. He states that 'a cloud just descended... really, really dark. And suddenly I hated her. I hated me.' He describes how he tried to open the door, but was unable to; when the partner whom he was with laughed at him, Joe lost control because she found it funny. He beat her by punching and kicking her, while she lay helpless on the ground. He screamed abuse at her. The next day, he had a blackout. Now, he remembers every punch and kick. He states how ashamed and disgusted he is with himself. He is obviously contrite and he has not yet forgiven himself for his actions. In the next shot, Sarah comforts Joe and tells him that it is okay. The next scene is of a football match. Joe sees three men beating up Liam. Joe attempts to intervene. He helps Liam up and asks him if he is still clean. Liam states that he is. Liam confronts his wife when she comes home. He suspects that she has been using and asks her if she 'takes him for a prick.' Liam then yells that he will leave her to rot, grabs her by her neck and forces her to look at herself in the mirror. Joe then attends Liam's flat and encounters Liam's wife shooting up in the bathroom. An argument erupts between them. Joe offers to help her. She does not want the kind of help that Joe offers. Joe then reluctantly assists her to tie off one of her veins so that she can shoot up. Joe tries to make sense of her incoherent mumbles as she lies prostrate in the bathtub. Joe then goes to a snooker club where he asks after Liam's whereabouts. Joe tells one of the men that he encounters that Liam has a four-year-old boy in an attempt to mitigate matters. Liam says that he does not want them to take liberties. He comes across Liam and is cross because Liam told him that he had stopped dealing. A tearful Liam confesses that he still owes money. Joe also tells Liam that he suspects that his wife is on the game. He is worried that people are going to break his legs. Joe and Sarah prepare a meal together, which is interrupted when they have sex. The next day, Joe goes to Stella Maris' B & B in order to deal with the matter of Liam. In a later scene, Joe gives Sarah a pair of earrings, as well as a ring. Joe tells Sarah that he loves her. Sarah tells him that she does not want it and Joe cannot understand what he has done wrong. Joe is confused as to why Sarah has behaved in this fashion. In the next shot, we see a copy of the Alcoholics Anonymous' small blue Bible as Joe listens to Beethoven's Violin Concerto in D Major and makes notes in a book. When Sarah arrives at his door, she apologises. They drink tea together and later embrace. Joe drives his van and his mates direct him to a place where they rob another van. At the outset, Joe does not know where they are going. Joe is shocked with his unwitting role in the robbery of Astral Sports. He still acts as the get-away driver. At the next football match, Joe cleverly remarks that the other team look like budgies because of their blue and yellow striped uniforms. Meanwhile, Sarah reveals to her co-worker Maggie that she is pregnant. Maggie congratulates her. At Sarah's flat, she expresses her reservations about Joe's dealings with Liam. Joe tells her that there are some things that she does not need to know. Joe outlines the limited choices that Liam faces, most of which are not pleasant. Sarah accuses Joe of being a drug dealer and asks where he got the money for her earrings and ring. Joe replies that the gang gave him some money. Sarah becomes enraged and asks, 'Are you going to hit me too, Joe?' Joe attends Liam's flat and states that Liam must deal with things himself. Joe returns to his flat with bottles of Smirnoff Vodka. He pours himself a drink, and takes a sip. Liam then goes to Joe's flat, where Joe is very inebriated. Joe does not understand why Liam has come to see him. Joe calls Liam a 'stupid wee prick.' The alcohol has overtaken Joe and he is hostile to Liam, who needs his help. As Liam witnesses members of the gang coming towards the premises, Liam realises that Joe has passed out and he kisses Joe on his forehead. Joe suddenly snaps awake and realises that Liam has taken his own life by hanging himself. The film concludes with Liam's funeral.
6189444Unlucky plumber – Athanasius Borshchov   and his friend Fedulov  spend all day and night avoiding work and finding opportunities to drink. Afonya takes ""kickbacks"" from clients and is often in trouble with the local committee for his behaviour. Afonya meets plasterer Kolya  in a pub, gets drunk and comes home. When his girlfriend sees the state he's in, she leaves him. The next morning he can't even remember yesterday's drinking companion. Things continue to go downhill for Afonya. When student interns from the vocational school are allocated to the plumbers, master ZHEK Vostryakovo  doesn't allocate any to him, fearing that he will not teach them well. Afonya begs for trainees and gets two. Having worked with him for one day and having seen his attitude and working methods, the trainees refuse to work with him anymore. The next day, Kolya arrives to live at Afonya's, having been thrown out of his house by his wife. At a dance Afonya meets young nurse Katya Snegireva , who knows about him through her brother, who used to play in Afonya's volleyball team. Afonya doesn't pay her much attention, because he's more interested in older women and already has his eye on one at the dance. However, a romantic walk with the older woman after the dance is over before it begins – Afonya is challenged to a fight by a hooligan, who he'd quarrelled with at the dance. The hooligan's friends join in, and finish the unequal fight. Katya worries for Afonya's safety, and calls the militia - which will only bring Anfonya to the committee's attention again. At a regular work call Borshchov meets Helen  and falls in love at first sight. He starts finding any excuse to work in her flat - even fooling a tenant, astronomer , by swapping his new Finnish sink for an old one, so he can install the Finnish sink in Helen's home as a gift. In his dreams Athos sees a family idyll with his wife Helen and their perfect children. Katya Snegireva, head over heels for Afonya, keeps engineering new meetings with him, and stops at nothing to attract his attention: ""Athanasius! someone called, I thought it was – you ... "". Afonya is completely oblivious to her feelings. Meanwhile Afonya's run in with the militia catches up with him and, for persistent drunkenness, truancy and fighting Afonya is threatened with being sacked at a meeting of the local committee. In addition, if he doesn't restore the Finnish sink he's definitely going to be fired. Afonya takes a porcelain sink with flowers to Helen to swap with the Finnish sink, but meets Helen coming home with company. She makes her feelings quite clear: she has her own life among fashionable and wealthy men, and Afonya is just a plumber. Afonya, depressed, goes to a restaurant with Fedulov and tries to escape into drunkenness, but it doesn't help. In his drunken state he goes to Katya Snegireva's home and proposes marriage, and wakes up next to her in the morning. Katya tells him she's due to move to Africa with work and wonders if she should cancel for Afonya. Afonya then decides to go back to his village, to his aunt Frosya , who brought him up. In the village, he meets his childhood friend Concertina  and, in a joyous moment sends the city a telegram resigning from his job and giving up his apartment. Only then does he learn that Aunt Frosya died two years ago. Afonya's depression increases – he has lost everything and has nowhere to go. Neighbour Uncle Yegor  gives Athos his Aunt Frosya's legacy – savings account in his name, the deeds to her house, and the letters she'd sent to herself, pretending they were from Afonya to the neighbours . The guilt of having ignored her only increases his gloom. Athanasius goes to the post office and tries to call Katya Snegireva on her memorable phone number 50-50-2, or as he says himself, ""rug-rug or two."" The answer comes back - Katya has left. Finally frustrated, he goes to the airport. He does not care where he's going or what will happen to him. Things have gotten so bad that a local militia man has to be convinced Afonya is the man in his passport photograph, so grim has he gotten since it was taken. Finally, just when Athanasius is heading to the AN-2 aircraft , a familiar girlish voice calls out. It's Katya, suitcase in hand: ""Athanasius!, someone called, I thought it was – you ... "

1273501Early in the Second World War, a raiding party of six Nazi sailors, caught ashore when their U-boat is sunk in Hudson Bay, attempt to evade capture by travelling across Canada to the still-neutral United States. The film's title comes from the 49th parallel north which marks part of the border between the two countries. Led by Lieutenants Hirth  and Kuhnecke , the small band of sailors encounter and sometimes brutalize a wide range of people, including the Eskimo Nick , the French-Canadian trapper , the floatplane crew and local Eskimo onlookers, pacifistic German Hutterite farmers, an innocent motorist, and the eccentric English academic and author ([[Leslie Howard . Making their way across Canada first using a stolen seaplane, the five surviving members of the Nazi band try to stir up sympathy among the Hutterite community outside Winnipeg, believing them to be countrymen. Lieutenant Hirth's stirring speech is rejected by Peter , the community's leader, and even by one of their own, Vogel , who comes to the aid of Anna . Vogel is tried by Lieutenant Hirth and summarily executed for the greater crime of trying to break away from the Nazi group. Hijacking an innocent motorist for his automobile, Hirth, Lohrmann and Kranz flee West. With all of Canada searching for them, and having killed 11 civilians along the way, Lohrmann is arrested by Canadian Mounties at a public gathering. Next, Kranz  is knocked out cold by writer Phillip A-Scott  in a cave - despite having been wounded. Finally, the story comes to a head with a confrontation on a freight train between Hirth, the sole remaining fugitive at large, and AWOL Canadian soldier Andy Brock . When Hirth learns the train has crossed into the United States, he surrenders his gun to a customs official and demands to be taken to the German embassy in the U.S. . However, Brock points out that Hirth is locked in the freight hold, but is not listed on the freight manifest, and convinces both American customs officials instead, that the freight car together with Hirth and Brock be sent back to Canada as ""improperly manifested cargo"" - which they readily comply with. The film ends with the train reversing to Canada and Brock about to pummel Hirth in the boxcar.

13379536The book club is the brainchild of fiftysomething six-time divorcée Bernadette, who latches onto the idea when she meets Prudie, a prim, married high school French teacher in her mid-20s, at a Jane Austen film festival. Her concept is to have six members discuss all of Austen's six novels, with each member hosting the group once a month. Also inducted into the club are Sylvia, a fortysomething librarian who recently has separated from her philandering lawyer husband Daniel after more than two decades of marriage; Sylvia's 20-something lesbian daughter Allegra; Jocelyn, a happily unmarried control freak and breeder of Rhodesian Ridgebacks who has been Sylvia's friend since childhood; and Grigg, a science fiction fan who's roped into the group by Jocelyn with the hope he and Sylvia will prove to be a compatible match. As the months pass, each of the members develops characteristics similar to those of Austen's characters and reacts to events in their lives in much the same way their fictional counterparts would. Bernadette is the matriarch figure who longs to see everyone find happiness. Sylvia clings to her belief in steadfast love and devotion, and eventually reconciles with Daniel. Jocelyn denies her own feelings for Grigg while playing matchmaker for him and Sylvia. Prudie, encumbered with her inattentive husband Dean and a free-spirited, pot-smoking, aging-hippie mother, a product of the 1960s counterculture, finds herself desperately trying not to succumb to her feelings for her seductive student Trey. Allegra, who tends to meet her lovers while engaging in death-defying activities, feels betrayed when she discovers her current partner, aspiring writer Corinne, has used Allegra's life as the basis for her short stories. Grigg is attracted to Jocelyn and mystified by her seeming lack of interest in him, marked by her failure to read the Ursula K. Le Guin novels he has hoped will catch her fancy. He also serves as the comedic foil to Jocelyn and Prudie's very serious takes on the books.

1937542Living In Oblivion is divided into three parts, all of which concern the making of a low-budget movie featuring the same director, crew and substantially the same cast. Part one: Director Nick Reve  is shooting a low-budget independent film in the middle of New York City. The catering crew are under-funded and apathetic, deciding not to replace a carton of milk that has been on the craft service table for a week. The scene being shot is a difficult one: a young woman, Ellen, reproaches her elderly mother  for not intervening when the father beat Ellen as a child. However, on the set, just about everything that can go wrong does go wrong: shots are spoiled because of the mic boom is visible; the camera assistant fails to keep the shot in focus; Cora, the actress playing the mother, forgets her lines; and Nicole, the actress playing Ellen, becomes increasingly unfocused and careless. A dispirited Nick calls for a rehearsal without camera to refresh the actors. However, when Nicole  berates herself for acting badly, Cora  reassures her with a gesture that reminds Nicole of a similar gesture made by her own terminally ill mother. Nicole is so upset by the memory that she turns in an unexpectedly passionate performance; and Cora, startled by Nicole's sudden intensity, is equally good. Watching them, Nick becomes enthusiastic all over again. Unfortunately, it was not captured on film; cinematographer and camera operator Wolf , who has been diluting the sub-standard coffee with the spoiled milk, was vomiting in the toilet throughout. Nick ruefully calls for another take. This time, a sudden and insistent beeping sound distracts the actors. Nobody can tell where it's coming from; and Nick flies into a rage, berating everyone on the crew and cast for their inadequacies. He then wakes up in his own bed; the beeping sound was his own alarm clock. He has dreamed the entire segment. It is 4.30am; and he is due on set. Part two: Early the same morning, the film's lead actor Chad Palomino  is getting dressed in Nicole's hotel room. They have spent the night together, and Chad suggests that they might get together again later; Nicole politely declines. Chad and Nicole arrive on the set separately. Nicole's character Ellen and Chad's character Damian have been in love for years but have never admitted it until the scene being shot on this day. Shooting the scene is made practically impossible by Chad's irregular acting. He keeps changing his mind about where to stand and continually moves to places where he is either invisible or badly lit by scenic light. Nicole becomes increasingly frustrated by Chad's egomania; and, when he starts to stroke her head, she briefly loses her cool, then apologizes. An irritated Chad demands a private talk with Nick. He tells Nick that he has slept with Nicole and makes out that it was she, not he, who had wanted to continue the relationship. Desperate to keep Chad happy, Nick agrees that Nicole is not very good. Nicole overhears this conversation on the sound mixer's headphones. Pretending to be contrite, she asks Nick if they can improvise a little; but, when they do so, she announces to everyone that, although she slept with Chad, she is not at all interested in him. Chad loses his temper and quits the movie. Relieved that he will no longer have to please Chad, Nick calls him a ""Hostess Twinkie motherfucker"" and a fight breaks out. Nick beats Chad senseless and fires him. He apologises to Nicole and confesses that he loves her. They kiss—then Nicole abruptly wakes up, still in her bed, having dreamed the whole thing. Part three: Later the same day, the crew is setting up for a dream sequence in which Nicole, as Ellen, stands still while a dwarf walks around her holding an apple. Nick claims to have learned a lesson from his own dream: That sometimes, ""you just got to roll with things."" Nicole admits that she had a dream with Nick in it but doesn't tell him what happened. Nick manages to keep up his positive attitude despite the various mishaps that occur: The smoke machine fails to work, then it catches fire, then his senile mother Cora arrives on the set. However, the ill-tempered dwarf actor Tito  complains that the dream sequence is a cliché  and walks off the set in disgust. Nick's confidence collapses, and he announces that the movie is over. At that moment, his mother intervenes, grabbing the apple, moving to Tito's mark and announcing that she is ""ready"". The crew scrambles to shoot the scene, and her manic performance injects fresh energy and conviction into it. Nick is delighted and decides to keep the new dream sequence, and there is a tense moment while the sound mixer records 30 seconds of room tone. The entire cast and crew manages to remain silent, and they go on to shooting the next sequence.

His colleague Tammy  knocks on the toilet door to hurry him up and as they walk to the car she instructs him on the art of the 'death-knock': knocking on the doors of the recently bereaved to obtain quotes and pictures of the deceased for the newspaper. Niall's poor track record has put his job on the line and Tammy has been detailed to improve his hit-rate. When they reach the house of Mrs Wright, who has lost her son in a car accident, Niall goes in first while Tammy waits outside. Before Niall can introduce himself and launch into his spiel that Tammy has prepared for him, Mrs Wright  interrupts him - ""I know who you are"" - and ushers him into the house. There she ropes him into unstacking the dishwasher as Niall tries in vain to broach the subject of the bereavement against the sound of a fire alarm which has been set off by the cigarette Mrs Wright is smoking. Mrs Wright appears baffled by Niall's requests for pictures and instead offers him some soup telling him they will look at some pictures ""in the morning"", much to Niall's surprise. She then leads him upstairs to the bedroom and encourages him to get some rest. Trapped in the bedroom, Niall examines the dead boy's belongings and finds himself playing with his toys. Meanwhile, Tammy waits outside taking a phone call from her boss at the newspaper, to whom she explains that Niall ""is still in there, so he must be doing alright"". Whilst playing with a light sabre, Niall knocks off a shelf-load of items and as he picks them up, he finds a photo of the dead boy. Mrs Wright, alerted by the noise, appears behind him and embracing Niall, she tells him: ""it's been a long day: time for bed."" Tammy knocks at the door and attempts to talk to Mrs Wright about the accident in which her son was killed, but Mrs Wright replies that her son is in his room and that there must be some mistake. Closing the door, she is nonetheless shaken by Tammy's insistence that her son is dead and she climbs the stairs to the bedroom where she finds Niall tucked up fast asleep in her son's bed. She kisses him on the cheek and switches out the light.

After years of drought, the region finally gets rain, leading to the farmers to rejoice. Shambu owns two bighas  of land, which is the only means of livelihood for the whole family. The local zamindar  Thakur Harnam Singh ([[Murad  partners with some city business men to construct a mill on his large parcel of land, which in return would profit them and bring prosperity to the village. The only problem is that in the middle of Harnam singh's land lay Shambu's meager two bighas of land. Harnam Singh is very confident that he could buy Shambu's land.

Shambu loses the case, however the judge orders Shambu to pay back 235 rupees to Harnam Singh in three months. If Shambu is not able to pay back his debt, then his land would be auctioned off and the proceeds would go to pay off his debts.

20841547Somewhere in Beverly Hills, in the house of Jack Benny , a mouse version of Jack is practicing his violin---off key---and saying to himself, ""Who is this guy Isaac Stern?""  Outside Jack's mouse hole, a cat is lying in wait, wearing ear muffs to filter out the discordant sound of Jack's violin. Jack calls his servant, Rochester  to get his white suit, which Rochester is wearing at the time. Jack tells the valet that his rental period is up  and he needs the suit because he is taking Mary Livingstone out for her birthday, and, true to character, is looking for a good cheap restaurant. While waiting for Mary, Jack decides to count his cheese in a basement vault. Using a coin on a string, he opens the lock, which appears to be a coin-operated lock from a pay toilet. As soon as he walks through the door, he takes a cane from a nail on the wall and starts humming We're in the Money. When he reaches the bottom of the stairs, he reaches through a hole and trips a razor blade hanging above the passageway like a guillotine. He then comes up to a derringer and uses the cane to trip the trigger on the derringer. Finally, he comes up to another hole, reaches through with the cane and trips a mousetrap. He then reaches the vault door, opens a combination lock, pulls the door open and numerous sound effects including various alarms, a foghorn and machine gun noises are heard. Ed, the vault guard, asks ""who goes there?"", and then an exchange is heard where Ed, apparently having been in the vault for a long time, asks ""did we win the war yet?"" When Benny assures Ed that the war had been won, thinking that Ed was referring to World War II, Ed says: ""That's good. What do you think we'll do with the Kaiser?"" Mary arrives while Jack is inspecting his cheese vault, and he emerges wondering who has been pilfering his gorgonzola. A fat rodent version of Don Wilson attempts to deliver a commercial when Jack advises him that this is a movie and not a television program. When Mary suggests a place, Jack's eyes ring up like an old cash register with a dollar sign  and ""no sale"", they discuss other options. As they were discussing the options, the cat writes a message extolling the ""Kit Kat Club""  and sends it to Jack as a paper airplane. Jack and Mary putter off in his Maxwell with Rochester behind the wheel until they reach the Kit Kat Club by following the arrows pointing to it. While enroute, Mary asks for champagne, while Jack says that he prefers a good ""mousecatel"". Unbeknownst to them, the ""club"" is actually the maw of a real cat, and as they enter, the cat's mouth closes on them. Jack cries: ""Help! Help!"" as the camera cuts to the live-action Jack Benny, who wakes up and, breaking the fourth wall, tells the audience: ""Gosh, what a crazy dream! Imagine- Mary and me as two little mice trapped inside a cat's mouth! And me playing the violin!"" At that point, Jack is interrupted by the sound of a discordant ""Rock-a-Bye Baby"" played on the violin, coming from within Jack's live-action cat. From there, the rodent versions of Jack and Mary emerge unharmed from the live-action cat. Following one last bit of animation , the real Jack Benny does one of his famous ""takes"" as the cartoon fades out.
1730420While driving cross-country from Boston to San Diego in their new Jeep Grand Cherokee, Jeff Taylor and his wife Amy narrowly miss colliding with a beat-up Ford F-150 that darts in front of them from an connecting road on a deserted highway. Later, while stopped at a gas station, the truck's driver, Earl, exchanges hostile words with Jeff before the couple resume their journey. Shortly afterwards, their Jeep breaks down in the middle of the desert. Leaving Jeff with the car, Amy accepts a ride from a passing big-rig trucker named Red Barr driving a Peterbilt 385, to get to a nearby diner and call for help. Jeff eventually discovers that the Jeep's battery connections have been suspiciously tampered with, and, after reconnecting them, drives to the diner, only to find that no one has seen his wife. When he catches up with Barr on the road and forces him to stop, the trucker claims he has never seen Jeff or his wife before. Jeff hails a passing sheriff, named Boyd, but a brief search of Barr's truck yields no sign of Amy, and he is let go. Jeff then goes to a police station where he is advised by a deputy to go back to the diner and wait for his wife. There Jeff meets with a simpleton mechanic named Billy, who says he saw Amy arrive in one truck and leave in another. He tells Jeff where they have taken her, but refuses to speak with the police, thinking that they are involved. Jeff heads to the location Billy mentioned, but is ambushed on a back road by Earl, and escapes by driving his Jeep into a river. Abandoning the Jeep and later circling back to watch his attackers salvage the Jeep from the water, Jeff is discovered and knocked out by Billy, an accomplice who had feigned mental impairment earlier. Jeff awakens in a car trunk surrounded by Earl, Billy, another accomplice, Al, a tow-truck driver, and their leader, Red Barr. Red tells Jeff that his wife will be released in exchange for $90,000 that the kidnappers think Jeff has in his bank account. Knowing that he only has a small fraction of the assumed amount, Jeff enters a nearby bank to withdraw what little money he has. After a failed attempt to alert the bank manager to his danger, Jeff steals marked money ribbons and a letter opener from the manager's desk; Jeff uses money ribbons to packet $1 bills in-between two $100 bills, fooling the kidnappers. With the ransom now in hand, Jeff is then instructed by phone to leave town, where he is picked up and bound with duct tape by Earl in his pickup truck. While gloating about how easy Jeff and his wife were to abduct by rigging their car to break down after leaving the gas station, as well as bragging that he intends to kill Jeff and his wife anyway, Earl discovers Jeff's ruse with the ransom. At exactly the same moment, Jeff frees himself and stabs Earl in the chest with the letter opener. After a struggle in the speeding, swerving pickup, Jeff takes over the vehicle, bounds Earl, and forces him to reveal his rendezvous with Red at a local truck stop. Sheriff Boyd appears in his patrol car and, seeing the swerving pickup, calls for backup and stops the vehicle. After Jeff exits the truck with Earl's pistol in hand, a stressed Boyd mistakes the situation and forces Jeff at gunpoint down onto the road. Earl frees himself and shoots Boyd with another pistol concealed in his boot. Just as Earl is about to shoot Jeff, a wounded Boyd shoots and kills Earl. Jeff uses Boyd's radio to call for an ambulance and heads to the truck stop Earl mentioned. At the rest stop, Jeff avoids the police looking for him in connection to the shooting of Boyd, and then spots Red talking on a payphone with another accomplice. Jeff follows Red to his truck where he jumps under the moving truck as Red drives away. Jeff loses his pistol while climbing aboard, but stows away to Red's farm at which he arrives early the next morning. Hiding in a barn, Jeff watches as Red and his remaining accomplices take a bound and gagged Amy and lock her in a freezer in the barn's cellar, leaving her to die. Unable to open the locked cellar door, Jeff finds a gun in Red's truck and uses it to hold Red, his accomplices, and his wife and son at gunpoint, demands the cellar key. Billy escapes, but Jeff forces the rest of the group to safely release Amy from the freezer before locking them in the cellar. Jeff and Amy then flee in a stolen Chevrolet C-20 pickup, while Billy frees Red and Al. They pursue the Taylors in their respective vehicles. During the climactic chase, Billy is killed in a fiery crash when Jeff forces his car off the road, while the trailer from Red's truck detaches, causing Al to violently crash into it. Undeterred, Red attempts to ram Jeff's vehicle off a bridge, trapping Amy's leg underneath the dashboard. Red's big rig nearly falls off the edge and becomes suspended by a steel bridge support. Jeff battles Red on the suspended big rig, eventually hurling Red to the rocks below. Jeff frees Amy from the dashboard in which she  pulls the automatic shift on their pickup, causing the semi to fall on Red and crush him. Sitting on the edge of the bridge beside their mangled pickup truck, Jeff and Amy embrace each other.

12064359 The film is presented as found footage from a personal video camera recovered by the United States Department of Defense. A disclaimer text states that the footage is of a case designated ""Cloverfield"" and was found in the area ""formerly known as Central Park"". The video consists chiefly of segments taped the night of Friday, May 22, 2009. The newer segments were taped over older video that is shown occasionally. The first video segment opens when Rob wakes up on the morning of Monday, April 27 having slept with Beth, a previously platonic friend. They make plans to go to Coney Island that day. The footage cuts to May 22, when Rob's brother Jason and his girlfriend Lily prepare a farewell party for Rob who will be moving to Japan. Their friend Hud uses the camera to film testimonials. After Beth leaves the party, an apparent earthquake strikes, and the city suffers a brief power outage. The local news reports that an oil tanker has capsized near Liberty Island. When the party-goers leave the building, they see the head of the Statue of Liberty crash into the street with several stunning scratch and bite marks. Hud records what appears to be a hand of a large creature several blocks away. The monster causes the Woolworth Building to collapse. Later, during the evacuation of the city, a gigantic tail destroys the Brooklyn Bridge, also killing Jason. News reports show the Army National Guard's 42nd Infantry Division attacking the monster and smaller ""parasite"" creatures falling off its body and attacking people.The creatures are called HSP or ""Human Scale Parasites"" in the Blu-ray special investigation mode. Rob listens to a phone message from Beth saying she is trapped in her apartment and unable to move. Going against the crowd, Rob, Hud, Lily, and Marlena  venture to Midtown Manhattan to rescue Beth. They are attacked by several of the ""parasite"" creatures; Marlena is bitten by one of them. They come across a command center and field hospital, where Marlena dies. One of the military leaders tells the group when the last evacuation helicopter will depart before the military executes its ""Hammer Down Protocol"", which will destroy Manhattan. The group rescues Beth, who was impaled on a piece of rebar. The four make their way to the evacuation site, where they encounter the monster once more over Grand Central Terminal. Lily is raced into one departing Marine Corps helicopter. Moments later, Rob, Beth and Hud are taken away in a second helicopter and witness a U.S. Air Force B-2 Spirit bomb the monster. The monster falls, then lunges at the helicopter, causing it to crash into Central Park.  The film skips to less than an hour later, with a voice on the crashed helicopter's radio warning that the Hammer Down protocol will begin in 15 minutes. The three friends regain consciousness and flee the helicopter. As they leave, the monster kills Hud. Rob and Beth grab the camera and take shelter under Greyshot Arch in Central Park as air raid sirens begin to blare and bombing starts. Rob and Beth take turns leaving their last testimonies of the day, which Rob mentions as Saturday, May 23. The bridge crumbles and debris covers the camera.According to the ""military intelligence"" in the special investigation mode of the Blu-ray version, this was the only thing that protected the camera during the Hammer Down protocol The film then cuts to the footage of Rob and Beth's Coney Island date on April 27. In the distance, unnoticed by Rob and Beth, a large object falls into the ocean.

384990Ann  lives in Baton Rouge. She is unhappily married to John  and has never experienced an orgasm. She is seeing a counselor for her problems. Graham Dalton  is an old college friend of John's. He is now a seeming drifter who, after nine years, returns to live in Baton Rouge. Graham arrives to find Ann, who has no idea that John has invited Graham to stay with them until he finds an apartment. When John arrives home, Graham's demeanor becomes remarkably more guarded, due in large part to John's overt disapproval of Graham's bohemian persona. They also discuss the fact that Graham's college girlfriend, Elizabeth, is also living in Baton Rouge. John is sleeping with Ann's sister, Cynthia , a free-spirited bartender. He rationalizes it by blaming Ann's frigidity. He frequently leaves his law office mid-day to meet with Cynthia, instructing his secretary to reschedule clients who are already in the lobby waiting to see him. Ann makes an impromptu visit to Graham's apartment, where she notices stacks of camcorder tapes around the television. When pressed, Graham explains that he interviews women about their sexual experiences and fantasies, on videotape. Ann, overcome with shock and confusion, flees his apartment. Within a day, Cynthia appears at Graham's apartment and introduces herself. Cynthia presses Graham to explain what ""spooked"" Ann the preceding day. Graham explains the videotapes, and admits to Cynthia his sexual dysfunction: that he is impotent when in the presence of another person, and that he achieves gratification by watching these videos in private. Graham propositions Cynthia to make a tape, assuring her that no other person is allowed to see the tapes. She believes him, and agrees. Cynthia reports back to Ann, who is horrified. Cynthia also tells John. When Ann discovers Cynthia's pearl earring in her bedroom, she is furious. She heads over to Graham's apartment with the intention of making a videotape. Graham objects, telling her it is something she would not do in a normal frame of mind. She insists and Graham relents. Afterward, Ann demands a divorce from John. In the ensuing argument, John gleans that Ann has been to Graham's, and that she made a video. He hits Graham and locks him out of the house, then watches Ann's tape. In it, Ann says she has never felt any kind of 'satisfaction' from sex. After Graham asks if she ever thinks of having sex with other men, she admits she has thought of Graham. Ann later turns the camera on Graham. Graham confesses that he is haunted by Elizabeth, and that his motivation in returning to Baton Rouge is a vague notion of reconnecting with her. He explains that he was a pathological liar, which destroyed an otherwise rewarding relationship with Elizabeth. He explains that he has since gone to great lengths to keep people at a distance and avoid relationships. Graham turns off the camera; it is implied that the two have sex. A chastened John joins Graham on the front patio and, with obvious pleasure, confesses to having sex with Elizabeth while she and Graham were a couple. Furious, Graham goes into a rage and destroys all of the tapes, as well as his camera. In the end, John is summoned to his boss's office, where it’s implied that he is about to be fired due to his frequent cancellations of meetings with important clients to have sexual trysts with Cynthia. In the next scene, Ann and Cynthia reconcile at the bar Cynthia tends before Ann returns home and joins Graham on the front porch, as they appear to be a couple.
1430058The film begins with Joe Kavanagh at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, relaying an experience from his past. He states the ritualised greeting: 'My name is Joe and I'm an alcoholic.' He feels that he is not in a position to drink anymore with safety. He tells the group that he copes by praying and states that he is grateful to be at the meeting. He receives a round of applause for his admissions. He goes round to his friend's place, bangs on the door and pretends to be the police. His friends soon realise that they have been tricked. They then travel in Joe's van where they examine stolen sporting merchandise which is of low quality. Joe and his friends stop at another person's house in order to pick up more people. A car cuts off the van. Joe later encounters the driver, whom Joe later describes as being 'the woman who tried to kill us all.' He exits his van and asks the woman if she lost her guide dog. The woman, Sarah, states that she is a health visitor. She wants to see Liam and his child, but Joe explains that Liam has an important football game to attend. The next shot is of the football match. Joe is very encouraging as a coach. The other team appears in white and black, which are the colours that Joe's team wears. Joe's team express their anger at this and respond by taking their shirts off so that they are able to distinguish between players. The other team scores the first goal of the game. Joe drives Liam home and tells Liam to take things one day at a time. Liam abruptly tells Joe to pull over and Liam runs up to a male who acts aggressively towards him. Joe does not hear what transpires between Liam and the man. Later, Joe sees Sarah, who is seen struggling with wallpaper in her car. Joe appears to fancy her, as Sarah tells him her name and he flirts with her. Joe then helps an acquaintance of Sarah's to complete a wall papering and paint job in Sarah's flat. Sarah then leaves the lads to it. She later brings them tea as they paint the ceiling and sing to themselves. They then look outside and notice someone taking photos of them through the window. Joe runs outside with his can of white paint and brush to confront the man who was taking the photos. The photographer tells Joe that he was just doing his job and that he has a bad heart. Joe then paints all over the photographer's car. The car speeds away and manages to knock over a pile of rubbish by the side of the road. Later, Sarah and Joe have dinner together. They are able to make comfortable conversation with one another. There is a bottle of red wine on the table, but Joe does not drink any of the alcohol. Sarah's telephone rings and she leaves the kitchen to answer it. Joe is then left alone with the wine. He clears his plate and appears somewhat nervous. When Sarah finishes with her telephone conversation, Joe asks her about the photographs on her wall. Joe later reveals to Sarah that he does not drink, to which Sarah replies: 'Why didn't you say?' Joe reveals that he is an alcoholic and he has not had a drink in ten months. Joe is happy that Sarah knows and that she has been direct in her responses to him. Joe thanks Sarah for her company. Sarah pays Joe for the work that he completed on her flat and they part company. Joe attends the Mayfield Health Centre. The practice is very busy and the receptionist tries to cope with a patient who is complaining because he has been waiting a long time in order to receive his prescription. Joe tells the receptionist that he would like to see Sarah. The receptionist does not appear to be surprised by his request and says that Joe is free to pop his head around the door. He sees Sarah advising parents on dealing with the changing of nappies. Outside the Health Centre, Joe asks Sarah if she would like to go ten-pin bowling with him and to ring him if she fancies going. They then part company. Sarah speaks with a female colleague, Maggie, and says that Joe seems a bit wild. She states that she is not going to go bowling with Joe. The next shot is of a bowling alley, with 'Spirit in the Sky' playing in the background. Sarah and Joe bowl together and laugh at their many errors. They occupy Aisle 16 and neither of them are spectacular players. They go back to Sarah's place where she asks him in for a cup of tea. Joe politely says no. Sarah offers him money for a taxi. A friendly argument ensues, at the end of which Sarah finds herself locked out of her flat. Sarah says that she can sleep in her car. Joe states that Sarah can sleep at his place, but not necessarily together. They arrive at Joe's and he shows her around his flat. While Joe makes tea for Sarah, she asks him if it is alright to put some music on. She puts on the same piece of music that the audience heard during the opening credits of the film, Beethoven's Violin Concerto in D Major. Joe tells Sarah that he used to be in a band and they won a local talent contest. Joe tells Sarah a story of how he was desperate for a drink one day and what transpired. He went to a music shop and stole some cassettes. He took one of them home and 'got pissed.' He describes the experience as being 'magical.' When Sarah asks him what made him stop drinking, Joe asks her why she wants to know. He is not hostile, but curious. Joe says that he is scared to tell her and that there is a strong chance that she will hate him if he tells. Joe explains that there was a girl he used to drink with and they loved one another. They were both 'just tangled up' and they used to get into terrible arguments and tear one another apart. The audience then sees a flashback where Joe and the girl are returning home from a night out. He states that 'a cloud just descended... really, really dark. And suddenly I hated her. I hated me.' He describes how he tried to open the door, but was unable to; when the partner whom he was with laughed at him, Joe lost control because she found it funny. He beat her by punching and kicking her, while she lay helpless on the ground. He screamed abuse at her. The next day, he had a blackout. Now, he remembers every punch and kick. He states how ashamed and disgusted he is with himself. He is obviously contrite and he has not yet forgiven himself for his actions. In the next shot, Sarah comforts Joe and tells him that it is okay. The next scene is of a football match. Joe sees three men beating up Liam. Joe attempts to intervene. He helps Liam up and asks him if he is still clean. Liam states that he is. Liam confronts his wife when she comes home. He suspects that she has been using and asks her if she 'takes him for a prick.' Liam then yells that he will leave her to rot, grabs her by her neck and forces her to look at herself in the mirror. Joe then attends Liam's flat and encounters Liam's wife shooting up in the bathroom. An argument erupts between them. Joe offers to help her. She does not want the kind of help that Joe offers. Joe then reluctantly assists her to tie off one of her veins so that she can shoot up. Joe tries to make sense of her incoherent mumbles as she lies prostrate in the bathtub. Joe then goes to a snooker club where he asks after Liam's whereabouts. Joe tells one of the men that he encounters that Liam has a four-year-old boy in an attempt to mitigate matters. Liam says that he does not want them to take liberties. He comes across Liam and is cross because Liam told him that he had stopped dealing. A tearful Liam confesses that he still owes money. Joe also tells Liam that he suspects that his wife is on the game. He is worried that people are going to break his legs. Joe and Sarah prepare a meal together, which is interrupted when they have sex. The next day, Joe goes to Stella Maris' B & B in order to deal with the matter of Liam. In a later scene, Joe gives Sarah a pair of earrings, as well as a ring. Joe tells Sarah that he loves her. Sarah tells him that she does not want it and Joe cannot understand what he has done wrong. Joe is confused as to why Sarah has behaved in this fashion. In the next shot, we see a copy of the Alcoholics Anonymous' small blue Bible as Joe listens to Beethoven's Violin Concerto in D Major and makes notes in a book. When Sarah arrives at his door, she apologises. They drink tea together and later embrace. Joe drives his van and his mates direct him to a place where they rob another van. At the outset, Joe does not know where they are going. Joe is shocked with his unwitting role in the robbery of Astral Sports. He still acts as the get-away driver. At the next football match, Joe cleverly remarks that the other team look like budgies because of their blue and yellow striped uniforms. Meanwhile, Sarah reveals to her co-worker Maggie that she is pregnant. Maggie congratulates her. At Sarah's flat, she expresses her reservations about Joe's dealings with Liam. Joe tells her that there are some things that she does not need to know. Joe outlines the limited choices that Liam faces, most of which are not pleasant. Sarah accuses Joe of being a drug dealer and asks where he got the money for her earrings and ring. Joe replies that the gang gave him some money. Sarah becomes enraged and asks, 'Are you going to hit me too, Joe?' Joe attends Liam's flat and states that Liam must deal with things himself. Joe returns to his flat with bottles of Smirnoff Vodka. He pours himself a drink, and takes a sip. Liam then goes to Joe's flat, where Joe is very inebriated. Joe does not understand why Liam has come to see him. Joe calls Liam a 'stupid wee prick.' The alcohol has overtaken Joe and he is hostile to Liam, who needs his help. As Liam witnesses members of the gang coming towards the premises, Liam realises that Joe has passed out and he kisses Joe on his forehead. Joe suddenly snaps awake and realises that Liam has taken his own life by hanging himself. The film concludes with Liam's funeral.
6189444Unlucky plumber – Athanasius Borshchov   and his friend Fedulov  spend all day and night avoiding work and finding opportunities to drink. Afonya takes ""kickbacks"" from clients and is often in trouble with the local committee for his behaviour. Afonya meets plasterer Kolya  in a pub, gets drunk and comes home. When his girlfriend sees the state he's in, she leaves him. The next morning he can't even remember yesterday's drinking companion. Things continue to go downhill for Afonya. When student interns from the vocational school are allocated to the plumbers, master ZHEK Vostryakovo  doesn't allocate any to him, fearing that he will not teach them well. Afonya begs for trainees and gets two. Having worked with him for one day and having seen his attitude and working methods, the trainees refuse to work with him anymore. The next day, Kolya arrives to live at Afonya's, having been thrown out of his house by his wife. At a dance Afonya meets young nurse Katya Snegireva , who knows about him through her brother, who used to play in Afonya's volleyball team. Afonya doesn't pay her much attention, because he's more interested in older women and already has his eye on one at the dance. However, a romantic walk with the older woman after the dance is over before it begins – Afonya is challenged to a fight by a hooligan, who he'd quarrelled with at the dance. The hooligan's friends join in, and finish the unequal fight. Katya worries for Afonya's safety, and calls the militia - which will only bring Anfonya to the committee's attention again. At a regular work call Borshchov meets Helen  and falls in love at first sight. He starts finding any excuse to work in her flat - even fooling a tenant, astronomer , by swapping his new Finnish sink for an old one, so he can install the Finnish sink in Helen's home as a gift. In his dreams Athos sees a family idyll with his wife Helen and their perfect children. Katya Snegireva, head over heels for Afonya, keeps engineering new meetings with him, and stops at nothing to attract his attention: ""Athanasius! someone called, I thought it was – you ... "". Afonya is completely oblivious to her feelings. Meanwhile Afonya's run in with the militia catches up with him and, for persistent drunkenness, truancy and fighting Afonya is threatened with being sacked at a meeting of the local committee. In addition, if he doesn't restore the Finnish sink he's definitely going to be fired. Afonya takes a porcelain sink with flowers to Helen to swap with the Finnish sink, but meets Helen coming home with company. She makes her feelings quite clear: she has her own life among fashionable and wealthy men, and Afonya is just a plumber. Afonya, depressed, goes to a restaurant with Fedulov and tries to escape into drunkenness, but it doesn't help. In his drunken state he goes to Katya Snegireva's home and proposes marriage, and wakes up next to her in the morning. Katya tells him she's due to move to Africa with work and wonders if she should cancel for Afonya. Afonya then decides to go back to his village, to his aunt Frosya , who brought him up. In the village, he meets his childhood friend Concertina  and, in a joyous moment sends the city a telegram resigning from his job and giving up his apartment. Only then does he learn that Aunt Frosya died two years ago. Afonya's depression increases – he has lost everything and has nowhere to go. Neighbour Uncle Yegor  gives Athos his Aunt Frosya's legacy – savings account in his name, the deeds to her house, and the letters she'd sent to herself, pretending they were from Afonya to the neighbours . The guilt of having ignored her only increases his gloom. Athanasius goes to the post office and tries to call Katya Snegireva on her memorable phone number 50-50-2, or as he says himself, ""rug-rug or two."" The answer comes back - Katya has left. Finally frustrated, he goes to the airport. He does not care where he's going or what will happen to him. Things have gotten so bad that a local militia man has to be convinced Afonya is the man in his passport photograph, so grim has he gotten since it was taken. Finally, just when Athanasius is heading to the AN-2 aircraft , a familiar girlish voice calls out. It's Katya, suitcase in hand: ""Athanasius!, someone called, I thought it was – you ... "

1273501Early in the Second World War, a raiding party of six Nazi sailors, caught ashore when their U-boat is sunk in Hudson Bay, attempt to evade capture by travelling across Canada to the still-neutral United States. The film's title comes from the 49th parallel north which marks part of the border between the two countries. Led by Lieutenants Hirth  and Kuhnecke , the small band of sailors encounter and sometimes brutalize a wide range of people, including the Eskimo Nick , the French-Canadian trapper , the floatplane crew and local Eskimo onlookers, pacifistic German Hutterite farmers, an innocent motorist, and the eccentric English academic and author ([[Leslie Howard . Making their way across Canada first using a stolen seaplane, the five surviving members of the Nazi band try to stir up sympathy among the Hutterite community outside Winnipeg, believing them to be countrymen. Lieutenant Hirth's stirring speech is rejected by Peter , the community's leader, and even by one of their own, Vogel , who comes to the aid of Anna . Vogel is tried by Lieutenant Hirth and summarily executed for the greater crime of trying to break away from the Nazi group. Hijacking an innocent motorist for his automobile, Hirth, Lohrmann and Kranz flee West. With all of Canada searching for them, and having killed 11 civilians along the way, Lohrmann is arrested by Canadian Mounties at a public gathering.

13379536The book club is the brainchild of fiftysomething six-time divorcée Bernadette, who latches onto the idea when she meets Prudie, a prim, married high school French teacher in her mid-20s, at a Jane Austen film festival. Her concept is to have six members discuss all of Austen's six novels, with each member hosting the group once a month. Also inducted into the club are Sylvia, a fortysomething librarian who recently has separated from her philandering lawyer husband Daniel after more than two decades of marriage; Sylvia's 20-something lesbian daughter Allegra; Jocelyn, a happily unmarried control freak and breeder of Rhodesian Ridgebacks who has been Sylvia's friend since childhood; and Grigg, a science fiction fan who's roped into the group by Jocelyn with the hope he and Sylvia will prove to be a compatible match. As the months pass, each of the members develops characteristics similar to those of Austen's characters and reacts to events in their lives in much the same way their fictional counterparts would. Bernadette is the matriarch figure who longs to see everyone find happiness. Sylvia clings to her belief in steadfast love and devotion, and eventually reconciles with Daniel. Jocelyn denies her own feelings for Grigg while playing matchmaker for him and Sylvia. Prudie, encumbered with her inattentive husband Dean and a free-spirited, pot-smoking, aging-hippie mother, a product of the 1960s counterculture, finds herself desperately trying not to succumb to her feelings for her seductive student Trey. Allegra, who tends to meet her lovers while engaging in death-defying activities, feels betrayed when she discovers her current partner, aspiring writer Corinne, has used Allegra's life as the basis for her short stories. Grigg is attracted to Jocelyn and mystified by her seeming lack of interest in him, marked by her failure to read the Ursula K. Le Guin novels he has hoped will catch her fancy. He also serves as the comedic foil to Jocelyn and Prudie's very serious takes on the books.

1937542Living In Oblivion is divided into three parts, all of which concern the making of a low-budget movie featuring the same director, crew and substantially the same cast. Part one: Director Nick Reve  is shooting a low-budget independent film in the middle of New York City. The catering crew are under-funded and apathetic, deciding not to replace a carton of milk that has been on the craft service table for a week. The scene being shot is a difficult one: a young woman, Ellen, reproaches her elderly mother  for not intervening when the father beat Ellen as a child. However, on the set, just about everything that can go wrong does go wrong: shots are spoiled because of the mic boom is visible; the camera assistant fails to keep the shot in focus; Cora, the actress playing the mother, forgets her lines; and Nicole, the actress playing Ellen, becomes increasingly unfocused and careless. A dispirited Nick calls for a rehearsal without camera to refresh the actors. However, when Nicole  berates herself for acting badly, Cora  reassures her with a gesture that reminds Nicole of a similar gesture made by her own terminally ill mother. Nicole is so upset by the memory that she turns in an unexpectedly passionate performance; and Cora, startled by Nicole's sudden intensity, is equally good. Watching them, Nick becomes enthusiastic all over again. Unfortunately, it was not captured on film; cinematographer and camera operator Wolf , who has been diluting the sub-standard coffee with the spoiled milk, was vomiting in the toilet throughout. Nick ruefully calls for another take. This time, a sudden and insistent beeping sound distracts the actors. Nobody can tell where it's coming from; and Nick flies into a rage, berating everyone on the crew and cast for their inadequacies. He then wakes up in his own bed; the beeping sound was his own alarm clock. He has dreamed the entire segment. It is 4.30am; and he is due on set. Part two: Early the same morning, the film's lead actor Chad Palomino  is getting dressed in Nicole's hotel room. They have spent the night together, and Chad suggests that they might get together again later; Nicole politely declines. Chad and Nicole arrive on the set separately. Nicole's character Ellen and Chad's character Damian have been in love for years but have never admitted it until the scene being shot on this day. Shooting the scene is made practically impossible by Chad's irregular acting. He keeps changing his mind about where to stand and continually moves to places where he is either invisible or badly lit by scenic light. Nicole becomes increasingly frustrated by Chad's egomania; and, when he starts to stroke her head, she briefly loses her cool, then apologizes. An irritated Chad demands a private talk with Nick. He tells Nick that he has slept with Nicole and makes out that it was she, not he, who had wanted to continue the relationship. Desperate to keep Chad happy, Nick agrees that Nicole is not very good. Nicole overhears this conversation on the sound mixer's headphones. Pretending to be contrite, she asks Nick if they can improvise a little; but, when they do so, she announces to everyone that, although she slept with Chad, she is not at all interested in him. Chad loses his temper and quits the movie. Relieved that he will no longer have to please Chad, Nick calls him a ""Hostess Twinkie motherfucker"" and a fight breaks out. Nick beats Chad senseless and fires him. He apologises to Nicole and confesses that he loves her. They kiss—then Nicole abruptly wakes up, still in her bed, having dreamed the whole thing. Part three: Later the same day, the crew is setting up for a dream sequence in which Nicole, as Ellen, stands still while a dwarf walks around her holding an apple. Nick claims to have learned a lesson from his own dream: That sometimes, ""you just got to roll with things."" Nicole admits that she had a dream with Nick in it but doesn't tell him what happened. Nick manages to keep up his positive attitude despite the various mishaps that occur: The smoke machine fails to work, then it catches fire, then his senile mother Cora arrives on the set. However, the ill-tempered dwarf actor Tito  complains that the dream sequence is a cliché  and walks off the set in disgust. Nick's confidence collapses, and he announces that the movie is over. At that moment, his mother intervenes, grabbing the apple, moving to Tito's mark and announcing that she is ""ready"". The crew scrambles to shoot the scene, and her manic performance injects fresh energy and conviction into it. Nick is delighted and decides to keep the new dream sequence, and there is a tense moment while the sound mixer records 30 seconds of room tone. The entire cast and crew manages to remain silent, and they go on to shooting the next sequence.

His colleague Tammy  knocks on the toilet door to hurry him up and as they walk to the car she instructs him on the art of the 'death-knock': knocking on the doors of the recently bereaved to obtain quotes and pictures of the deceased for the newspaper. Niall's poor track record has put his job on the line and Tammy has been detailed to improve his hit-rate. When they reach the house of Mrs Wright, who has lost her son in a car accident, Niall goes in first while Tammy waits outside. Before Niall can introduce himself and launch into his spiel that Tammy has prepared for him, Mrs Wright  interrupts him - ""I know who you are"" - and ushers him into the house. There she ropes him into unstacking the dishwasher as Niall tries in vain to broach the subject of the bereavement against the sound of a fire alarm which has been set off by the cigarette Mrs Wright is smoking. Mrs Wright appears baffled by Niall's requests for pictures and instead offers him some soup telling him they will look at some pictures ""in the morning"", much to Niall's surprise. She then leads him upstairs to the bedroom and encourages him to get some rest. Trapped in the bedroom, Niall examines the dead boy's belongings and finds himself playing with his toys. Meanwhile, Tammy waits outside taking a phone call from her boss at the newspaper, to whom she explains that Niall ""is still in there, so he must be doing alright"". Whilst playing with a light sabre, Niall knocks off a shelf-load of items and as he picks them up, he finds a photo of the dead boy. Mrs Wright, alerted by the noise, appears behind him and embracing Niall, she tells him: ""it's been a long day: time for bed."" Tammy knocks at the door and attempts to talk to Mrs Wright about the accident in which her son was killed, but Mrs Wright replies that her son is in his room and that there must be some mistake. Closing the door, she is nonetheless shaken by Tammy's insistence that her son is dead and she climbs the stairs to the bedroom where she finds Niall tucked up fast asleep in her son's bed. She kisses him on the cheek and switches out the light.

20841547Somewhere in Beverly Hills, in the house of Jack Benny , a mouse version of Jack is practicing his violin---off key---and saying to himself, ""Who is this guy Isaac Stern?""  Outside Jack's mouse hole, a cat is lying in wait, wearing ear muffs to filter out the discordant sound of Jack's violin. Jack calls his servant, Rochester  to get his white suit, which Rochester is wearing at the time. Jack tells the valet that his rental period is up  and he needs the suit because he is taking Mary Livingstone out for her birthday, and, true to character, is looking for a good cheap restaurant. While waiting for Mary, Jack decides to count his cheese in a basement vault. Using a coin on a string, he opens the lock, which appears to be a coin-operated lock from a pay toilet. As soon as he walks through the door, he takes a cane from a nail on the wall and starts humming We're in the Money. When he reaches the bottom of the stairs, he reaches through a hole and trips a razor blade hanging above the passageway like a guillotine. He then comes up to a derringer and uses the cane to trip the trigger on the derringer. Finally, he comes up to another hole, reaches through with the cane and trips a mousetrap. He then reaches the vault door, opens a combination lock, pulls the door open and numerous sound effects including various alarms, a foghorn and machine gun noises are heard. Ed, the vault guard, asks ""who goes there?"", and then an exchange is heard where Ed, apparently having been in the vault for a long time, asks ""did we win the war yet?"" When Benny assures Ed that the war had been won, thinking that Ed was referring to World War II, Ed says: ""That's good. What do you think we'll do with the Kaiser?"" Mary arrives while Jack is inspecting his cheese vault, and he emerges wondering who has been pilfering his gorgonzola. A fat rodent version of Don Wilson attempts to deliver a commercial when Jack advises him that this is a movie and not a television program. When Mary suggests a place, Jack's eyes ring up like an old cash register with a dollar sign  and ""no sale"", they discuss other options. As they were discussing the options, the cat writes a message extolling the ""Kit Kat Club""  and sends it to Jack as a paper airplane. Jack and Mary putter off in his Maxwell with Rochester behind the wheel until they reach the Kit Kat Club by following the arrows pointing to it. While enroute, Mary asks for champagne, while Jack says that he prefers a good ""mousecatel"". Unbeknownst to them, the ""club"" is actually the maw of a real cat, and as they enter, the cat's mouth closes on them. Jack cries: ""Help! Help!"" as the camera cuts to the live-action Jack Benny, who wakes up and, breaking the fourth wall, tells the audience: ""Gosh, what a crazy dream! Imagine- Mary and me as two little mice trapped inside a cat's mouth! And me playing the violin!"" At that point, Jack is interrupted by the sound of a discordant ""Rock-a-Bye Baby"" played on the violin, coming from within Jack's live-action cat. From there, the rodent versions of Jack and Mary emerge unharmed from the live-action cat. Following one last bit of animation , the real Jack Benny does one of his famous ""takes"" as the cartoon fades out.
1730420While driving cross-country from Boston to San Diego in their new Jeep Grand Cherokee, Jeff Taylor and his wife Amy narrowly miss colliding with a beat-up Ford F-150 that darts in front of them from an connecting road on a deserted highway. Later, while stopped at a gas station, the truck's driver, Earl, exchanges hostile words with Jeff before the couple resume their journey. Shortly afterwards, their Jeep breaks down in the middle of the desert. Leaving Jeff with the car, Amy accepts a ride from a passing big-rig trucker named Red Barr driving a Peterbilt 385, to get to a nearby diner and call for help. Jeff eventually discovers that the Jeep's battery connections have been suspiciously tampered with, and, after reconnecting them, drives to the diner, only to find that no one has seen his wife. When he catches up with Barr on the road and forces him to stop, the trucker claims he has never seen Jeff or his wife before. Jeff hails a passing sheriff, named Boyd, but a brief search of Barr's truck yields no sign of Amy, and he is let go. Jeff then goes to a police station where he is advised by a deputy to go back to the diner and wait for his wife. There Jeff meets with a simpleton mechanic named Billy, who says he saw Amy arrive in one truck and leave in another. He tells Jeff where they have taken her, but refuses to speak with the police, thinking that they are involved. Jeff heads to the location Billy mentioned, but is ambushed on a back road by Earl, and escapes by driving his Jeep into a river. Abandoning the Jeep and later circling back to watch his attackers salvage the Jeep from the water, Jeff is discovered and knocked out by Billy, an accomplice who had feigned mental impairment earlier. Jeff awakens in a car trunk surrounded by Earl, Billy, another accomplice, Al, a tow-truck driver, and their leader, Red Barr. Red tells Jeff that his wife will be released in exchange for $90,000 that the kidnappers think Jeff has in his bank account. Knowing that he only has a small fraction of the assumed amount, Jeff enters a nearby bank to withdraw what little money he has. After a failed attempt to alert the bank manager to his danger, Jeff steals marked money ribbons and a letter opener from the manager's desk; Jeff uses money ribbons to packet $1 bills in-between two $100 bills, fooling the kidnappers. With the ransom now in hand, Jeff is then instructed by phone to leave town, where he is picked up and bound with duct tape by Earl in his pickup truck. While gloating about how easy Jeff and his wife were to abduct by rigging their car to break down after leaving the gas station, as well as bragging that he intends to kill Jeff and his wife anyway, Earl discovers Jeff's ruse with the ransom. At exactly the same moment, Jeff frees himself and stabs Earl in the chest with the letter opener. After a struggle in the speeding, swerving pickup, Jeff takes over the vehicle, bounds Earl, and forces him to reveal his rendezvous with Red at a local truck stop. Sheriff Boyd appears in his patrol car and, seeing the swerving pickup, calls for backup and stops the vehicle. After Jeff exits the truck with Earl's pistol in hand, a stressed Boyd mistakes the situation and forces Jeff at gunpoint down onto the road. Earl frees himself and shoots Boyd with another pistol concealed in his boot. Just as Earl is about to shoot Jeff, a wounded Boyd shoots and kills Earl. Jeff uses Boyd's radio to call for an ambulance and heads to the truck stop Earl mentioned. At the rest stop, Jeff avoids the police looking for him in connection to the shooting of Boyd, and then spots Red talking on a payphone with another accomplice. Jeff follows Red to his truck where he jumps under the moving truck as Red drives away. Jeff loses his pistol while climbing aboard, but stows away to Red's farm at which he arrives early the next morning. Hiding in a barn, Jeff watches as Red and his remaining accomplices take a bound and gagged Amy and lock her in a freezer in the barn's cellar, leaving her to die. Unable to open the locked cellar door, Jeff finds a gun in Red's truck and uses it to hold Red, his accomplices, and his wife and son at gunpoint, demands the cellar key. Billy escapes, but Jeff forces the rest of the group to safely release Amy from the freezer before locking them in the cellar. Jeff and Amy then flee in a stolen Chevrolet C-20 pickup, while Billy frees Red and Al. They pursue the Taylors in their respective vehicles. During the climactic chase, Billy is killed in a fiery crash when Jeff forces his car off the road, while the trailer from Red's truck detaches, causing Al to violently crash into it. Undeterred, Red attempts to ram Jeff's vehicle off a bridge, trapping Amy's leg underneath the dashboard. Red's big rig nearly falls off the edge and becomes suspended by a steel bridge support. Jeff battles Red on the suspended big rig, eventually hurling Red to the rocks below. Jeff frees Amy from the dashboard in which she  pulls the automatic shift on their pickup, causing the semi to fall on Red and crush him. Sitting on the edge of the bridge beside their mangled pickup truck, Jeff and Amy embrace each other.

12064359 The film is presented as found footage from a personal video camera recovered by the United States Department of Defense. A disclaimer text states that the footage is of a case designated ""Cloverfield"" and was found in the area ""formerly known as Central Park"". The video consists chiefly of segments taped the night of Friday, May 22, 2009. The newer segments were taped over older video that is shown occasionally. The first video segment opens when Rob wakes up on the morning of Monday, April 27 having slept with Beth, a previously platonic friend. They make plans to go to Coney Island that day. The footage cuts to May 22, when Rob's brother Jason and his girlfriend Lily prepare a farewell party for Rob who will be moving to Japan. Their friend Hud uses the camera to film testimonials. After Beth leaves the party, an apparent earthquake strikes, and the city suffers a brief power outage. The local news reports that an oil tanker has capsized near Liberty Island. When the party-goers leave the building, they see the head of the Statue of Liberty crash into the street with several stunning scratch and bite marks. Hud records what appears to be a hand of a large creature several blocks away. The monster causes the Woolworth Building to collapse. Later, during the evacuation of the city, a gigantic tail destroys the Brooklyn Bridge, also killing Jason. News reports show the Army National Guard's 42nd Infantry Division attacking the monster and smaller ""parasite"" creatures falling off its body and attacking people.The creatures are called HSP or ""Human Scale Parasites"" in the Blu-ray special investigation mode. Rob listens to a phone message from Beth saying she is trapped in her apartment and unable to move. Going against the crowd, Rob, Hud, Lily, and Marlena  venture to Midtown Manhattan to rescue Beth. They are attacked by several of the ""parasite"" creatures; Marlena is bitten by one of them. They come across a command center and field hospital, where Marlena dies. One of the military leaders tells the group when the last evacuation helicopter will depart before the military executes its ""Hammer Down Protocol"", which will destroy Manhattan. The group rescues Beth, who was impaled on a piece of rebar. The four make their way to the evacuation site, where they encounter the monster once more over Grand Central Terminal. Lily is raced into one departing Marine Corps helicopter. Moments later, Rob, Beth and Hud are taken away in a second helicopter and witness a U.S. Air Force B-2 Spirit bomb the monster. The monster falls, then lunges at the helicopter, causing it to crash into Central Park.  The film skips to less than an hour later, with a voice on the crashed helicopter's radio warning that the Hammer Down protocol will begin in 15 minutes. The three friends regain consciousness and flee the helicopter. As they leave, the monster kills Hud. Rob and Beth grab the camera and take shelter under Greyshot Arch in Central Park as air raid sirens begin to blare and bombing starts. Rob and Beth take turns leaving their last testimonies of the day, which Rob mentions as Saturday, May 23. The bridge crumbles and debris covers the camera.According to the ""military intelligence"" in the special investigation mode of the Blu-ray version, this was the only thing that protected the camera during the Hammer Down protocol The film then cuts to the footage of Rob and Beth's Coney Island date on April 27. In the distance, unnoticed by Rob and Beth, a large object falls into the ocean.

384990Ann  lives in Baton Rouge. She is unhappily married to John  and has never experienced an orgasm. She is seeing a counselor for her problems. Graham Dalton  is an old college friend of John's. He is now a seeming drifter who, after nine years, returns to live in Baton Rouge. Graham arrives to find Ann, who has no idea that John has invited Graham to stay with them until he finds an apartment. When John arrives home, Graham's demeanor becomes remarkably more guarded, due in large part to John's overt disapproval of Graham's bohemian persona. They also discuss the fact that Graham's college girlfriend, Elizabeth, is also living in Baton Rouge. John is sleeping with Ann's sister, Cynthia , a free-spirited bartender. He rationalizes it by blaming Ann's frigidity. He frequently leaves his law office mid-day to meet with Cynthia, instructing his secretary to reschedule clients who are already in the lobby waiting to see him. Ann makes an impromptu visit to Graham's apartment, where she notices stacks of camcorder tapes around the television. When pressed, Graham explains that he interviews women about their sexual experiences and fantasies, on videotape. Ann, overcome with shock and confusion, flees his apartment. Within a day, Cynthia appears at Graham's apartment and introduces herself. Cynthia presses Graham to explain what ""spooked"" Ann the preceding day. Graham explains the videotapes, and admits to Cynthia his sexual dysfunction: that he is impotent when in the presence of another person, and that he achieves gratification by watching these videos in private. Graham propositions Cynthia to make a tape, assuring her that no other person is allowed to see the tapes. She believes him, and agrees. Cynthia reports back to Ann, who is horrified. Cynthia also tells John. When Ann discovers Cynthia's pearl earring in her bedroom, she is furious. She heads over to Graham's apartment with the intention of making a videotape. Graham objects, telling her it is something she would not do in a normal frame of mind. She insists and Graham relents. Afterward, Ann demands a divorce from John. In the ensuing argument, John gleans that Ann has been to Graham's, and that she made a video. He hits Graham and locks him out of the house, then watches Ann's tape. In it, Ann says she has never felt any kind of 'satisfaction' from sex. After Graham asks if she ever thinks of having sex with other men, she admits she has thought of Graham. Ann later turns the camera on Graham. Graham confesses that he is haunted by Elizabeth, and that his motivation in returning to Baton Rouge is a vague notion of reconnecting with her. He explains that he was a pathological liar, which destroyed an otherwise rewarding relationship with Elizabeth. He explains that he has since gone to great lengths to keep people at a distance and avoid relationships. Graham turns off the camera; it is implied that the two have sex. A chastened John joins Graham on the front patio and, with obvious pleasure, confesses to having sex with Elizabeth while she and Graham were a couple. Furious, Graham goes into a rage and destroys all of the tapes, as well as his camera. In the end, John is summoned to his boss's office, where it’s implied that he is about to be fired due to his frequent cancellations of meetings with important clients to have sexual trysts with Cynthia. In the next scene, Ann and Cynthia reconcile at the bar Cynthia tends before Ann returns home and joins Graham on the front porch, as they appear to be a couple.
1430058The film begins with Joe Kavanagh at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, relaying an experience from his past. He states the ritualised greeting: 'My name is Joe and I'm an alcoholic.' He feels that he is not in a position to drink anymore with safety. He tells the group that he copes by praying and states that he is grateful to be at the meeting. He receives a round of applause for his admissions. He goes round to his friend's place, bangs on the door and pretends to be the police. His friends soon realise that they have been tricked. They then travel in Joe's van where they examine stolen sporting merchandise which is of low quality. Joe and his friends stop at another person's house in order to pick up more people. A car cuts off the van. Joe later encounters the driver, whom Joe later describes as being 'the woman who tried to kill us all.' He exits his van and asks the woman if she lost her guide dog. The woman, Sarah, states that she is a health visitor. She wants to see Liam and his child, but Joe explains that Liam has an important football game to attend. The next shot is of the football match. Joe is very encouraging as a coach. The other team appears in white and black, which are the colours that Joe's team wears. Joe's team express their anger at this and respond by taking their shirts off so that they are able to distinguish between players. The other team scores the first goal of the game. Joe drives Liam home and tells Liam to take things one day at a time. Liam abruptly tells Joe to pull over and Liam runs up to a male who acts aggressively towards him. Joe does not hear what transpires between Liam and the man. Later, Joe sees Sarah, who is seen struggling with wallpaper in her car. Joe appears to fancy her, as Sarah tells him her name and he flirts with her. Joe then helps an acquaintance of Sarah's to complete a wall papering and paint job in Sarah's flat. Sarah then leaves the lads to it. She later brings them tea as they paint the ceiling and sing to themselves. They then look outside and notice someone taking photos of them through the window. Joe runs outside with his can of white paint and brush to confront the man who was taking the photos. The photographer tells Joe that he was just doing his job and that he has a bad heart. Joe then paints all over the photographer's car. The car speeds away and manages to knock over a pile of rubbish by the side of the road. Later, Sarah and Joe have dinner together. They are able to make comfortable conversation with one another. There is a bottle of red wine on the table, but Joe does not drink any of the alcohol. Sarah's telephone rings and she leaves the kitchen to answer it. Joe is then left alone with the wine. He clears his plate and appears somewhat nervous. When Sarah finishes with her telephone conversation, Joe asks her about the photographs on her wall. Joe later reveals to Sarah that he does not drink, to which Sarah replies: 'Why didn't you say?' Joe reveals that he is an alcoholic and he has not had a drink in ten months. Joe is happy that Sarah knows and that she has been direct in her responses to him. Joe thanks Sarah for her company. Sarah pays Joe for the work that he completed on her flat and they part company. Joe attends the Mayfield Health Centre. The practice is very busy and the receptionist tries to cope with a patient who is complaining because he has been waiting a long time in order to receive his prescription. Joe tells the receptionist that he would like to see Sarah. The receptionist does not appear to be surprised by his request and says that Joe is free to pop his head around the door. He sees Sarah advising parents on dealing with the changing of nappies. Outside the Health Centre, Joe asks Sarah if she would like to go ten-pin bowling with him and to ring him if she fancies going. They then part company. Sarah speaks with a female colleague, Maggie, and says that Joe seems a bit wild. She states that she is not going to go bowling with Joe. The next shot is of a bowling alley, with 'Spirit in the Sky' playing in the background. Sarah and Joe bowl together and laugh at their many errors. They occupy Aisle 16 and neither of them are spectacular players. They go back to Sarah's place where she asks him in for a cup of tea. Joe politely says no. Sarah offers him money for a taxi. A friendly argument ensues, at the end of which Sarah finds herself locked out of her flat. Sarah says that she can sleep in her car. Joe states that Sarah can sleep at his place, but not necessarily together. They arrive at Joe's and he shows her around his flat. While Joe makes tea for Sarah, she asks him if it is alright to put some music on. She puts on the same piece of music that the audience heard during the opening credits of the film, Beethoven's Violin Concerto in D Major. Joe tells Sarah that he used to be in a band and they won a local talent contest. Joe tells Sarah a story of how he was desperate for a drink one day and what transpired. He went to a music shop and stole some cassettes. He took one of them home and 'got pissed.' He describes the experience as being 'magical.' When Sarah asks him what made him stop drinking, Joe asks her why she wants to know. He is not hostile, but curious. Joe says that he is scared to tell her and that there is a strong chance that she will hate him if he tells. Joe explains that there was a girl he used to drink with and they loved one another. They were both 'just tangled up' and they used to get into terrible arguments and tear one another apart. The audience then sees a flashback where Joe and the girl are returning home from a night out. He states that 'a cloud just descended... really, really dark. And suddenly I hated her. I hated me.' He describes how he tried to open the door, but was unable to; when the partner whom he was with laughed at him, Joe lost control because she found it funny. He beat her by punching and kicking her, while she lay helpless on the ground. He screamed abuse at her. The next day, he had a blackout. Now, he remembers every punch and kick. He states how ashamed and disgusted he is with himself. He is obviously contrite and he has not yet forgiven himself for his actions. In the next shot, Sarah comforts Joe and tells him that it is okay. The next scene is of a football match. Joe sees three men beating up Liam. Joe attempts to intervene. He helps Liam up and asks him if he is still clean. Liam states that he is. Liam confronts his wife when she comes home. He suspects that she has been using and asks her if she 'takes him for a prick.' Liam then yells that he will leave her to rot, grabs her by her neck and forces her to look at herself in the mirror. Joe then attends Liam's flat and encounters Liam's wife shooting up in the bathroom. An argument erupts between them. Joe offers to help her. She does not want the kind of help that Joe offers. Joe then reluctantly assists her to tie off one of her veins so that she can shoot up. Joe tries to make sense of her incoherent mumbles as she lies prostrate in the bathtub. Joe then goes to a snooker club where he asks after Liam's whereabouts. Joe tells one of the men that he encounters that Liam has a four-year-old boy in an attempt to mitigate matters. Liam says that he does not want them to take liberties. He comes across Liam and is cross because Liam told him that he had stopped dealing. A tearful Liam confesses that he still owes money. Joe also tells Liam that he suspects that his wife is on the game. He is worried that people are going to break his legs. Joe and Sarah prepare a meal together, which is interrupted when they have sex. The next day, Joe goes to Stella Maris' B & B in order to deal with the matter of Liam. In a later scene, Joe gives Sarah a pair of earrings, as well as a ring. Joe tells Sarah that he loves her. Sarah tells him that she does not want it and Joe cannot understand what he has done wrong. Joe is confused as to why Sarah has behaved in this fashion. In the next shot, we see a copy of the Alcoholics Anonymous' small blue Bible as Joe listens to Beethoven's Violin Concerto in D Major and makes notes in a book. When Sarah arrives at his door, she apologises. They drink tea together and later embrace. Joe drives his van and his mates direct him to a place where they rob another van. At the outset, Joe does not know where they are going. Joe is shocked with his unwitting role in the robbery of Astral Sports. He still acts as the get-away driver. At the next football match, Joe cleverly remarks that the other team look like budgies because of their blue and yellow striped uniforms. Meanwhile, Sarah reveals to her co-worker Maggie that she is pregnant. Maggie congratulates her. At Sarah's flat, she expresses her reservations about Joe's dealings with Liam. Joe tells her that there are some things that she does not need to know. Joe outlines the limited choices that Liam faces, most of which are not pleasant. Sarah accuses Joe of being a drug dealer and asks where he got the money for her earrings and ring. Joe replies that the gang gave him some money. Sarah becomes enraged and asks, 'Are you going to hit me too, Joe?' Joe attends Liam's flat and states that Liam must deal with things himself. Joe returns to his flat with bottles of Smirnoff Vodka. He pours himself a drink, and takes a sip. Liam then goes to Joe's flat, where Joe is very inebriated. Joe does not understand why Liam has come to see him. Joe calls Liam a 'stupid wee prick.' The alcohol has overtaken Joe and he is hostile to Liam, who needs his help. As Liam witnesses members of the gang coming towards the premises, Liam realises that Joe has passed out and he kisses Joe on his forehead. Joe suddenly snaps awake and realises that Liam has taken his own life by hanging himself. The film concludes with Liam's funeral.
6189444Unlucky plumber – Athanasius Borshchov   and his friend Fedulov  spend all day and night avoiding work and finding opportunities to drink. Afonya takes ""kickbacks"" from clients and is often in trouble with the local committee for his behaviour. Afonya meets plasterer Kolya  in a pub, gets drunk and comes home. When his girlfriend sees the state he's in, she leaves him. The next morning he can't even remember yesterday's drinking companion. Things continue to go downhill for Afonya. When student interns from the vocational school are allocated to the plumbers, master ZHEK Vostryakovo  doesn't allocate any to him, fearing that he will not teach them well. Afonya begs for trainees and gets two. Having worked with him for one day and having seen his attitude and working methods, the trainees refuse to work with him anymore. The next day, Kolya arrives to live at Afonya's, having been thrown out of his house by his wife. At a dance Afonya meets young nurse Katya Snegireva , who knows about him through her brother, who used to play in Afonya's volleyball team. Afonya doesn't pay her much attention, because he's more interested in older women and already has his eye on one at the dance. However, a romantic walk with the older woman after the dance is over before it begins – Afonya is challenged to a fight by a hooligan, who he'd quarrelled with at the dance. The hooligan's friends join in, and finish the unequal fight. Katya worries for Afonya's safety, and calls the militia - which will only bring Anfonya to the committee's attention again. At a regular work call Borshchov meets Helen  and falls in love at first sight. He starts finding any excuse to work in her flat - even fooling a tenant, astronomer , by swapping his new Finnish sink for an old one, so he can install the Finnish sink in Helen's home as a gift. In his dreams Athos sees a family idyll with his wife Helen and their perfect children. Katya Snegireva, head over heels for Afonya, keeps engineering new meetings with him, and stops at nothing to attract his attention: ""Athanasius! someone called, I thought it was – you ... "". Afonya is completely oblivious to her feelings. Meanwhile Afonya's run in with the militia catches up with him and, for persistent drunkenness, truancy and fighting Afonya is threatened with being sacked at a meeting of the local committee. In addition, if he doesn't restore the Finnish sink he's definitely going to be fired. Afonya takes a porcelain sink with flowers to Helen to swap with the Finnish sink, but meets Helen coming home with company. She makes her feelings quite clear: she has her own life among fashionable and wealthy men, and Afonya is just a plumber. Afonya, depressed, goes to a restaurant with Fedulov and tries to escape into drunkenness, but it doesn't help. In his drunken state he goes to Katya Snegireva's home and proposes marriage, and wakes up next to her in the morning. Katya tells him she's due to move to Africa with work and wonders if she should cancel for Afonya. Afonya then decides to go back to his village, to his aunt Frosya , who brought him up. In the village, he meets his childhood friend Concertina  and, in a joyous moment sends the city a telegram resigning from his job and giving up his apartment. Only then does he learn that Aunt Frosya died two years ago. Afonya's depression increases – he has lost everything and has nowhere to go. Neighbour Uncle Yegor  gives Athos his Aunt Frosya's legacy – savings account in his name, the deeds to her house, and the letters she'd sent to herself, pretending they were from Afonya to the neighbours . The guilt of having ignored her only increases his gloom. Athanasius goes to the post office and tries to call Katya Snegireva on her memorable phone number 50-50-2, or as he says himself, ""rug-rug or two."" The answer comes back - Katya has left. Finally frustrated, he goes to the airport. He does not care where he's going or what will happen to him. Things have gotten so bad that a local militia man has to be convinced Afonya is the man in his passport photograph, so grim has he gotten since it was taken. Finally, just when Athanasius is heading to the AN-2 aircraft , a familiar girlish voice calls out. It's Katya, suitcase in hand: ""Athanasius!, someone called, I thought it was – you ... "

1273501Early in the Second World War, a raiding party of six Nazi sailors, caught ashore when their U-boat is sunk in Hudson Bay, attempt to evade capture by travelling across Canada to the still-neutral United States. The film's title comes from the 49th parallel north which marks part of the border between the two countries. Led by Lieutenants Hirth  and Kuhnecke , the small band of sailors encounter and sometimes brutalize a wide range of people, including the Eskimo Nick , the French-Canadian trapper , the floatplane crew and local Eskimo onlookers, pacifistic German Hutterite farmers, an innocent motorist, and the eccentric English academic and author ([[Leslie Howard . Making their way across Canada first using a stolen seaplane, the five surviving members of the Nazi band try to stir up sympathy among the Hutterite community outside Winnipeg, believing them to be countrymen. Lieutenant Hirth's stirring speech is rejected by Peter , the community's leader, and even by one of their own, Vogel , who comes to the aid of Anna . Vogel is tried by Lieutenant Hirth and summarily executed for the greater crime of trying to break away from the Nazi group. Hijacking an innocent motorist for his automobile, Hirth, Lohrmann and Kranz flee West. With all of Canada searching for them, and having killed 11 civilians along the way, Lohrmann is arrested by Canadian Mounties at a public gathering. Next, Kranz  is knocked out cold by writer Phillip A-Scott  in a cave - despite having been wounded. Finally, the story comes to a head with a confrontation on a freight train between Hirth, the sole remaining fugitive at large, and AWOL Canadian soldier Andy Brock . When Hirth learns the train has crossed into the United States, he surrenders his gun to a customs official and demands to be taken to the German embassy in the U.S. . However, Brock points out that Hirth is locked in the freight hold, but is not listed on the freight manifest, and convinces both American customs officials instead, that the freight car together with Hirth and Brock be sent back to Canada as ""improperly manifested cargo"" - which they readily comply with. The film ends with the train reversing to Canada and Brock about to pummel Hirth in the boxcar.

13379536The book club is the brainchild of fiftysomething six-time divorcée Bernadette, who latches onto the idea when she meets Prudie, a prim, married high school French teacher in her mid-20s, at a Jane Austen film festival. Her concept is to have six members discuss all of Austen's six novels, with each member hosting the group once a month. Also inducted into the club are Sylvia, a fortysomething librarian who recently has separated from her philandering lawyer husband Daniel after more than two decades of marriage; Sylvia's 20-something lesbian daughter Allegra; Jocelyn, a happily unmarried control freak and breeder of Rhodesian Ridgebacks who has been Sylvia's friend since childhood; and Grigg, a science fiction fan who's roped into the group by Jocelyn with the hope he and Sylvia will prove to be a compatible match. As the months pass, each of the members develops characteristics similar to those of Austen's characters and reacts to events in their lives in much the same way their fictional counterparts would. Bernadette is the matriarch figure who longs to see everyone find happiness. Sylvia clings to her belief in steadfast love and devotion, and eventually reconciles with Daniel. Jocelyn denies her own feelings for Grigg while playing matchmaker for him and Sylvia. Prudie, encumbered with her inattentive husband Dean and a free-spirited, pot-smoking, aging-hippie mother, a product of the 1960s counterculture, finds herself desperately trying not to succumb to her feelings for her seductive student Trey. Allegra, who tends to meet her lovers while engaging in death-defying activities, feels betrayed when she discovers her current partner, aspiring writer Corinne, has used Allegra's life as the basis for her short stories. Grigg is attracted to Jocelyn and mystified by her seeming lack of interest in him, marked by her failure to read the Ursula K. Le Guin novels he has hoped will catch her fancy. He also serves as the comedic foil to Jocelyn and Prudie's very serious takes on the books.

22778879The original plot is more-or-less adhered to, with some significant alterations. Benny is depicted as a comic Bob Hope-like coward, but not as a sissy. El Khobar's alter ego is that of a mild-mannered  Latin tutor and anthropologist, whom Birabeau hires to keep Margot from flirting with his regiment. The conclusion to the film is slightly different, since El Khobar is not Birabeau's son here. After the final battle, the General's soldiers realize that El Khobar and the Riffs were actually on their side and helped in preventing an uprising. When one asks, ""And where is El Khobar?"", MacRae, as the professor, enters carrying El Khobar's clothes, and quietly announces ""El Khobar is dead"". Margot is grief-stricken, but Birabeau, suspecting the truth, mischievously says that they can all be grateful to ""the ghost of El Khobar"", winking as he says this. As soon as they are alone, MacRae begins to sing the song One Alone to Margot, making her realize that her boring Latin tutor and the dashing El Khobar are one and the same. She rushes into his arms.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stidFull%20Synopsis One song not by Romberg, Gay Parisienne, written for the 1943 film version of the show, is retained for this film.
1937542Living In Oblivion is divided into three parts, all of which concern the making of a low-budget movie featuring the same director, crew and substantially the same cast. Part one: Director Nick Reve  is shooting a low-budget independent film in the middle of New York City. The catering crew are under-funded and apathetic, deciding not to replace a carton of milk that has been on the craft service table for a week. The scene being shot is a difficult one: a young woman, Ellen, reproaches her elderly mother  for not intervening when the father beat Ellen as a child. However, on the set, just about everything that can go wrong does go wrong: shots are spoiled because of the mic boom is visible; the camera assistant fails to keep the shot in focus; Cora, the actress playing the mother, forgets her lines; and Nicole, the actress playing Ellen, becomes increasingly unfocused and careless. A dispirited Nick calls for a rehearsal without camera to refresh the actors. However, when Nicole  berates herself for acting badly, Cora  reassures her with a gesture that reminds Nicole of a similar gesture made by her own terminally ill mother. Nicole is so upset by the memory that she turns in an unexpectedly passionate performance; and Cora, startled by Nicole's sudden intensity, is equally good. Watching them, Nick becomes enthusiastic all over again. Unfortunately, it was not captured on film; cinematographer and camera operator Wolf , who has been diluting the sub-standard coffee with the spoiled milk, was vomiting in the toilet throughout. Nick ruefully calls for another take. This time, a sudden and insistent beeping sound distracts the actors. Nobody can tell where it's coming from; and Nick flies into a rage, berating everyone on the crew and cast for their inadequacies. He then wakes up in his own bed; the beeping sound was his own alarm clock. He has dreamed the entire segment. It is 4.30am; and he is due on set. Part two: Early the same morning, the film's lead actor Chad Palomino  is getting dressed in Nicole's hotel room. They have spent the night together, and Chad suggests that they might get together again later; Nicole politely declines. Chad and Nicole arrive on the set separately. Nicole's character Ellen and Chad's character Damian have been in love for years but have never admitted it until the scene being shot on this day. Shooting the scene is made practically impossible by Chad's irregular acting. He keeps changing his mind about where to stand and continually moves to places where he is either invisible or badly lit by scenic light. Nicole becomes increasingly frustrated by Chad's egomania; and, when he starts to stroke her head, she briefly loses her cool, then apologizes. An irritated Chad demands a private talk with Nick. He tells Nick that he has slept with Nicole and makes out that it was she, not he, who had wanted to continue the relationship. Desperate to keep Chad happy, Nick agrees that Nicole is not very good. Nicole overhears this conversation on the sound mixer's headphones. Pretending to be contrite, she asks Nick if they can improvise a little; but, when they do so, she announces to everyone that, although she slept with Chad, she is not at all interested in him. Chad loses his temper and quits the movie. Relieved that he will no longer have to please Chad, Nick calls him a ""Hostess Twinkie motherfucker"" and a fight breaks out. Nick beats Chad senseless and fires him. He apologises to Nicole and confesses that he loves her. They kiss—then Nicole abruptly wakes up, still in her bed, having dreamed the whole thing. Part three: Later the same day, the crew is setting up for a dream sequence in which Nicole, as Ellen, stands still while a dwarf walks around her holding an apple. Nick claims to have learned a lesson from his own dream: That sometimes, ""you just got to roll with things."" Nicole admits that she had a dream with Nick in it but doesn't tell him what happened. Nick manages to keep up his positive attitude despite the various mishaps that occur: The smoke machine fails to work, then it catches fire, then his senile mother Cora arrives on the set. However, the ill-tempered dwarf actor Tito  complains that the dream sequence is a cliché  and walks off the set in disgust. Nick's confidence collapses, and he announces that the movie is over. At that moment, his mother intervenes, grabbing the apple, moving to Tito's mark and announcing that she is ""ready"". The crew scrambles to shoot the scene, and her manic performance injects fresh energy and conviction into it. Nick is delighted and decides to keep the new dream sequence, and there is a tense moment while the sound mixer records 30 seconds of room tone. The entire cast and crew manages to remain silent, and they go on to shooting the next sequence.
31555231In flashback, Niall , a local news reporter, recalls visiting his mother's grave, as he smartens up in a toilet mirror. His colleague Tammy  knocks on the toilet door to hurry him up and as they walk to the car she instructs him on the art of the 'death-knock': knocking on the doors of the recently bereaved to obtain quotes and pictures of the deceased for the newspaper. Niall's poor track record has put his job on the line and Tammy has been detailed to improve his hit-rate. When they reach the house of Mrs Wright, who has lost her son in a car accident, Niall goes in first while Tammy waits outside. Before Niall can introduce himself and launch into his spiel that Tammy has prepared for him, Mrs Wright  interrupts him - ""I know who you are"" - and ushers him into the house. There she ropes him into unstacking the dishwasher as Niall tries in vain to broach the subject of the bereavement against the sound of a fire alarm which has been set off by the cigarette Mrs Wright is smoking. Mrs Wright appears baffled by Niall's requests for pictures and instead offers him some soup telling him they will look at some pictures ""in the morning"", much to Niall's surprise. She then leads him upstairs to the bedroom and encourages him to get some rest. Trapped in the bedroom, Niall examines the dead boy's belongings and finds himself playing with his toys. Meanwhile, Tammy waits outside taking a phone call from her boss at the newspaper, to whom she explains that Niall ""is still in there, so he must be doing alright"". Whilst playing with a light sabre, Niall knocks off a shelf-load of items and as he picks them up, he finds a photo of the dead boy. Mrs Wright, alerted by the noise, appears behind him and embracing Niall, she tells him: ""it's been a long day: time for bed."" Tammy knocks at the door and attempts to talk to Mrs Wright about the accident in which her son was killed, but Mrs Wright replies that her son is in his room and that there must be some mistake. Closing the door, she is nonetheless shaken by Tammy's insistence that her son is dead and she climbs the stairs to the bedroom where she finds Niall tucked up fast asleep in her son's bed. She kisses him on the cheek and switches out the light.

After years of drought, the region finally gets rain, leading to the farmers to rejoice. Shambu owns two bighas  of land, which is the only means of livelihood for the whole family. The local zamindar  Thakur Harnam Singh ([[Murad  partners with some city business men to construct a mill on his large parcel of land, which in return would profit them and bring prosperity to the village.

20841547Somewhere in Beverly Hills, in the house of Jack Benny , a mouse version of Jack is practicing his violin---off key---and saying to himself, ""Who is this guy Isaac Stern?""  Outside Jack's mouse hole, a cat is lying in wait, wearing ear muffs to filter out the discordant sound of Jack's violin. Jack calls his servant, Rochester  to get his white suit, which Rochester is wearing at the time. Jack tells the valet that his rental period is up  and he needs the suit because he is taking Mary Livingstone out for her birthday, and, true to character, is looking for a good cheap restaurant. While waiting for Mary, Jack decides to count his cheese in a basement vault. Using a coin on a string, he opens the lock, which appears to be a coin-operated lock from a pay toilet. As soon as he walks through the door, he takes a cane from a nail on the wall and starts humming We're in the Money. When he reaches the bottom of the stairs, he reaches through a hole and trips a razor blade hanging above the passageway like a guillotine. He then comes up to a derringer and uses the cane to trip the trigger on the derringer. Finally, he comes up to another hole, reaches through with the cane and trips a mousetrap. He then reaches the vault door, opens a combination lock, pulls the door open and numerous sound effects including various alarms, a foghorn and machine gun noises are heard. Ed, the vault guard, asks ""who goes there?"", and then an exchange is heard where Ed, apparently having been in the vault for a long time, asks ""did we win the war yet?"" When Benny assures Ed that the war had been won, thinking that Ed was referring to World War II, Ed says: ""That's good. What do you think we'll do with the Kaiser?"" Mary arrives while Jack is inspecting his cheese vault, and he emerges wondering who has been pilfering his gorgonzola. A fat rodent version of Don Wilson attempts to deliver a commercial when Jack advises him that this is a movie and not a television program. When Mary suggests a place, Jack's eyes ring up like an old cash register with a dollar sign  and ""no sale"", they discuss other options. As they were discussing the options, the cat writes a message extolling the ""Kit Kat Club""  and sends it to Jack as a paper airplane. Jack and Mary putter off in his Maxwell with Rochester behind the wheel until they reach the Kit Kat Club by following the arrows pointing to it. While enroute, Mary asks for champagne, while Jack says that he prefers a good ""mousecatel"". Unbeknownst to them, the ""club"" is actually the maw of a real cat, and as they enter, the cat's mouth closes on them. Jack cries: ""Help! Help!"" as the camera cuts to the live-action Jack Benny, who wakes up and, breaking the fourth wall, tells the audience: ""Gosh, what a crazy dream! Imagine- Mary and me as two little mice trapped inside a cat's mouth! And me playing the violin!"" At that point, Jack is interrupted by the sound of a discordant ""Rock-a-Bye Baby"" played on the violin, coming from within Jack's live-action cat. From there, the rodent versions of Jack and Mary emerge unharmed from the live-action cat. Following one last bit of animation , the real Jack Benny does one of his famous ""takes"" as the cartoon fades out.
1730420While driving cross-country from Boston to San Diego in their new Jeep Grand Cherokee, Jeff Taylor and his wife Amy narrowly miss colliding with a beat-up Ford F-150 that darts in front of them from an connecting road on a deserted highway. Later, while stopped at a gas station, the truck's driver, Earl, exchanges hostile words with Jeff before the couple resume their journey. Shortly afterwards, their Jeep breaks down in the middle of the desert. Leaving Jeff with the car, Amy accepts a ride from a passing big-rig trucker named Red Barr driving a Peterbilt 385, to get to a nearby diner and call for help. Jeff eventually discovers that the Jeep's battery connections have been suspiciously tampered with, and, after reconnecting them, drives to the diner, only to find that no one has seen his wife. When he catches up with Barr on the road and forces him to stop, the trucker claims he has never seen Jeff or his wife before. Jeff hails a passing sheriff, named Boyd, but a brief search of Barr's truck yields no sign of Amy, and he is let go. Jeff then goes to a police station where he is advised by a deputy to go back to the diner and wait for his wife. There Jeff meets with a simpleton mechanic named Billy, who says he saw Amy arrive in one truck and leave in another. He tells Jeff where they have taken her, but refuses to speak with the police, thinking that they are involved. Jeff heads to the location Billy mentioned, but is ambushed on a back road by Earl, and escapes by driving his Jeep into a river. Abandoning the Jeep and later circling back to watch his attackers salvage the Jeep from the water, Jeff is discovered and knocked out by Billy, an accomplice who had feigned mental impairment earlier. Jeff awakens in a car trunk surrounded by Earl, Billy, another accomplice, Al, a tow-truck driver, and their leader, Red Barr. Red tells Jeff that his wife will be released in exchange for $90,000 that the kidnappers think Jeff has in his bank account. Knowing that he only has a small fraction of the assumed amount, Jeff enters a nearby bank to withdraw what little money he has. After a failed attempt to alert the bank manager to his danger, Jeff steals marked money ribbons and a letter opener from the manager's desk; Jeff uses money ribbons to packet $1 bills in-between two $100 bills, fooling the kidnappers. With the ransom now in hand, Jeff is then instructed by phone to leave town, where he is picked up and bound with duct tape by Earl in his pickup truck. While gloating about how easy Jeff and his wife were to abduct by rigging their car to break down after leaving the gas station, as well as bragging that he intends to kill Jeff and his wife anyway, Earl discovers Jeff's ruse with the ransom. At exactly the same moment, Jeff frees himself and stabs Earl in the chest with the letter opener. After a struggle in the speeding, swerving pickup, Jeff takes over the vehicle, bounds Earl, and forces him to reveal his rendezvous with Red at a local truck stop. Sheriff Boyd appears in his patrol car and, seeing the swerving pickup, calls for backup and stops the vehicle. After Jeff exits the truck with Earl's pistol in hand, a stressed Boyd mistakes the situation and forces Jeff at gunpoint down onto the road. Earl frees himself and shoots Boyd with another pistol concealed in his boot. Just as Earl is about to shoot Jeff, a wounded Boyd shoots and kills Earl. Jeff uses Boyd's radio to call for an ambulance and heads to the truck stop Earl mentioned. At the rest stop, Jeff avoids the police looking for him in connection to the shooting of Boyd, and then spots Red talking on a payphone with another accomplice. Jeff follows Red to his truck where he jumps under the moving truck as Red drives away. Jeff loses his pistol while climbing aboard, but stows away to Red's farm at which he arrives early the next morning. Hiding in a barn, Jeff watches as Red and his remaining accomplices take a bound and gagged Amy and lock her in a freezer in the barn's cellar, leaving her to die. Unable to open the locked cellar door, Jeff finds a gun in Red's truck and uses it to hold Red, his accomplices, and his wife and son at gunpoint, demands the cellar key. Billy escapes, but Jeff forces the rest of the group to safely release Amy from the freezer before locking them in the cellar. Jeff and Amy then flee in a stolen Chevrolet C-20 pickup, while Billy frees Red and Al. They pursue the Taylors in their respective vehicles. During the climactic chase, Billy is killed in a fiery crash when Jeff forces his car off the road, while the trailer from Red's truck detaches, causing Al to violently crash into it. Undeterred, Red attempts to ram Jeff's vehicle off a bridge, trapping Amy's leg underneath the dashboard. Red's big rig nearly falls off the edge and becomes suspended by a steel bridge support. Jeff battles Red on the suspended big rig, eventually hurling Red to the rocks below. Jeff frees Amy from the dashboard in which she  pulls the automatic shift on their pickup, causing the semi to fall on Red and crush him. Sitting on the edge of the bridge beside their mangled pickup truck, Jeff and Amy embrace each other.

12064359 The film is presented as found footage from a personal video camera recovered by the United States Department of Defense. A disclaimer text states that the footage is of a case designated ""Cloverfield"" and was found in the area ""formerly known as Central Park"". The video consists chiefly of segments taped the night of Friday, May 22, 2009. The newer segments were taped over older video that is shown occasionally. The first video segment opens when Rob wakes up on the morning of Monday, April 27 having slept with Beth, a previously platonic friend. They make plans to go to Coney Island that day. The footage cuts to May 22, when Rob's brother Jason and his girlfriend Lily prepare a farewell party for Rob who will be moving to Japan. Their friend Hud uses the camera to film testimonials. After Beth leaves the party, an apparent earthquake strikes, and the city suffers a brief power outage. The local news reports that an oil tanker has capsized near Liberty Island. When the party-goers leave the building, they see the head of the Statue of Liberty crash into the street with several stunning scratch and bite marks. Hud records what appears to be a hand of a large creature several blocks away. The monster causes the Woolworth Building to collapse. Later, during the evacuation of the city, a gigantic tail destroys the Brooklyn Bridge, also killing Jason. News reports show the Army National Guard's 42nd Infantry Division attacking the monster and smaller ""parasite"" creatures falling off its body and attacking people.The creatures are called HSP or ""Human Scale Parasites"" in the Blu-ray special investigation mode. Rob listens to a phone message from Beth saying she is trapped in her apartment and unable to move. Going against the crowd, Rob, Hud, Lily, and Marlena  venture to Midtown Manhattan to rescue Beth. They are attacked by several of the ""parasite"" creatures; Marlena is bitten by one of them. They come across a command center and field hospital, where Marlena dies. One of the military leaders tells the group when the last evacuation helicopter will depart before the military executes its ""Hammer Down Protocol"", which will destroy Manhattan. The group rescues Beth, who was impaled on a piece of rebar. The four make their way to the evacuation site, where they encounter the monster once more over Grand Central Terminal. Lily is raced into one departing Marine Corps helicopter. Moments later, Rob, Beth and Hud are taken away in a second helicopter and witness a U.S. Air Force B-2 Spirit bomb the monster. The monster falls, then lunges at the helicopter, causing it to crash into Central Park.  The film skips to less than an hour later, with a voice on the crashed helicopter's radio warning that the Hammer Down protocol will begin in 15 minutes. The three friends regain consciousness and flee the helicopter. As they leave, the monster kills Hud.

384990Ann  lives in Baton Rouge. She is unhappily married to John  and has never experienced an orgasm. She is seeing a counselor for her problems. Graham Dalton  is an old college friend of John's. He is now a seeming drifter who, after nine years, returns to live in Baton Rouge. Graham arrives to find Ann, who has no idea that John has invited Graham to stay with them until he finds an apartment. When John arrives home, Graham's demeanor becomes remarkably more guarded, due in large part to John's overt disapproval of Graham's bohemian persona. They also discuss the fact that Graham's college girlfriend, Elizabeth, is also living in Baton Rouge. John is sleeping with Ann's sister, Cynthia , a free-spirited bartender. He rationalizes it by blaming Ann's frigidity. He frequently leaves his law office mid-day to meet with Cynthia, instructing his secretary to reschedule clients who are already in the lobby waiting to see him. Ann makes an impromptu visit to Graham's apartment, where she notices stacks of camcorder tapes around the television. When pressed, Graham explains that he interviews women about their sexual experiences and fantasies, on videotape. Ann, overcome with shock and confusion, flees his apartment. Within a day, Cynthia appears at Graham's apartment and introduces herself. Cynthia presses Graham to explain what ""spooked"" Ann the preceding day. Graham explains the videotapes, and admits to Cynthia his sexual dysfunction: that he is impotent when in the presence of another person, and that he achieves gratification by watching these videos in private. Graham propositions Cynthia to make a tape, assuring her that no other person is allowed to see the tapes. She believes him, and agrees. Cynthia reports back to Ann, who is horrified. Cynthia also tells John. When Ann discovers Cynthia's pearl earring in her bedroom, she is furious. She heads over to Graham's apartment with the intention of making a videotape. Graham objects, telling her it is something she would not do in a normal frame of mind. She insists and Graham relents. Afterward, Ann demands a divorce from John. In the ensuing argument, John gleans that Ann has been to Graham's, and that she made a video. He hits Graham and locks him out of the house, then watches Ann's tape. In it, Ann says she has never felt any kind of 'satisfaction' from sex. After Graham asks if she ever thinks of having sex with other men, she admits she has thought of Graham. Ann later turns the camera on Graham. Graham confesses that he is haunted by Elizabeth, and that his motivation in returning to Baton Rouge is a vague notion of reconnecting with her. He explains that he was a pathological liar, which destroyed an otherwise rewarding relationship with Elizabeth. He explains that he has since gone to great lengths to keep people at a distance and avoid relationships. Graham turns off the camera; it is implied that the two have sex. A chastened John joins Graham on the front patio and, with obvious pleasure, confesses to having sex with Elizabeth while she and Graham were a couple. Furious, Graham goes into a rage and destroys all of the tapes, as well as his camera. In the end, John is summoned to his boss's office, where it’s implied that he is about to be fired due to his frequent cancellations of meetings with important clients to have sexual trysts with Cynthia. In the next scene, Ann and Cynthia reconcile at the bar Cynthia tends before Ann returns home and joins Graham on the front porch, as they appear to be a couple.
1430058The film begins with Joe Kavanagh at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, relaying an experience from his past. He states the ritualised greeting: 'My name is Joe and I'm an alcoholic.' He feels that he is not in a position to drink anymore with safety. He tells the group that he copes by praying and states that he is grateful to be at the meeting. He receives a round of applause for his admissions. He goes round to his friend's place, bangs on the door and pretends to be the police. His friends soon realise that they have been tricked. They then travel in Joe's van where they examine stolen sporting merchandise which is of low quality. Joe and his friends stop at another person's house in order to pick up more people. A car cuts off the van. Joe later encounters the driver, whom Joe later describes as being 'the woman who tried to kill us all.' He exits his van and asks the woman if she lost her guide dog. The woman, Sarah, states that she is a health visitor. She wants to see Liam and his child, but Joe explains that Liam has an important football game to attend. The next shot is of the football match. Joe is very encouraging as a coach. The other team appears in white and black, which are the colours that Joe's team wears. Joe's team express their anger at this and respond by taking their shirts off so that they are able to distinguish between players. The other team scores the first goal of the game. Joe drives Liam home and tells Liam to take things one day at a time. Liam abruptly tells Joe to pull over and Liam runs up to a male who acts aggressively towards him. Joe does not hear what transpires between Liam and the man. Later, Joe sees Sarah, who is seen struggling with wallpaper in her car. Joe appears to fancy her, as Sarah tells him her name and he flirts with her. Joe then helps an acquaintance of Sarah's to complete a wall papering and paint job in Sarah's flat. Sarah then leaves the lads to it. She later brings them tea as they paint the ceiling and sing to themselves. They then look outside and notice someone taking photos of them through the window. Joe runs outside with his can of white paint and brush to confront the man who was taking the photos. The photographer tells Joe that he was just doing his job and that he has a bad heart. Joe then paints all over the photographer's car. The car speeds away and manages to knock over a pile of rubbish by the side of the road. Later, Sarah and Joe have dinner together. They are able to make comfortable conversation with one another. There is a bottle of red wine on the table, but Joe does not drink any of the alcohol. Sarah's telephone rings and she leaves the kitchen to answer it. Joe is then left alone with the wine. He clears his plate and appears somewhat nervous. When Sarah finishes with her telephone conversation, Joe asks her about the photographs on her wall. Joe later reveals to Sarah that he does not drink, to which Sarah replies: 'Why didn't you say?' Joe reveals that he is an alcoholic and he has not had a drink in ten months. Joe is happy that Sarah knows and that she has been direct in her responses to him. Joe thanks Sarah for her company. Sarah pays Joe for the work that he completed on her flat and they part company. Joe attends the Mayfield Health Centre. The practice is very busy and the receptionist tries to cope with a patient who is complaining because he has been waiting a long time in order to receive his prescription. Joe tells the receptionist that he would like to see Sarah. The receptionist does not appear to be surprised by his request and says that Joe is free to pop his head around the door. He sees Sarah advising parents on dealing with the changing of nappies. Outside the Health Centre, Joe asks Sarah if she would like to go ten-pin bowling with him and to ring him if she fancies going. They then part company. Sarah speaks with a female colleague, Maggie, and says that Joe seems a bit wild. She states that she is not going to go bowling with Joe. The next shot is of a bowling alley, with 'Spirit in the Sky' playing in the background. Sarah and Joe bowl together and laugh at their many errors. They occupy Aisle 16 and neither of them are spectacular players. They go back to Sarah's place where she asks him in for a cup of tea. Joe politely says no. Sarah offers him money for a taxi. A friendly argument ensues, at the end of which Sarah finds herself locked out of her flat. Sarah says that she can sleep in her car. Joe states that Sarah can sleep at his place, but not necessarily together. They arrive at Joe's and he shows her around his flat. While Joe makes tea for Sarah, she asks him if it is alright to put some music on. She puts on the same piece of music that the audience heard during the opening credits of the film, Beethoven's Violin Concerto in D Major. Joe tells Sarah that he used to be in a band and they won a local talent contest. Joe tells Sarah a story of how he was desperate for a drink one day and what transpired. He went to a music shop and stole some cassettes. He took one of them home and 'got pissed.' He describes the experience as being 'magical.' When Sarah asks him what made him stop drinking, Joe asks her why she wants to know. He is not hostile, but curious. Joe says that he is scared to tell her and that there is a strong chance that she will hate him if he tells. Joe explains that there was a girl he used to drink with and they loved one another. They were both 'just tangled up' and they used to get into terrible arguments and tear one another apart. The audience then sees a flashback where Joe and the girl are returning home from a night out. He states that 'a cloud just descended... really, really dark. And suddenly I hated her. I hated me.' He describes how he tried to open the door, but was unable to; when the partner whom he was with laughed at him, Joe lost control because she found it funny. He beat her by punching and kicking her, while she lay helpless on the ground. He screamed abuse at her. The next day, he had a blackout. Now, he remembers every punch and kick. He states how ashamed and disgusted he is with himself. He is obviously contrite and he has not yet forgiven himself for his actions. In the next shot, Sarah comforts Joe and tells him that it is okay. The next scene is of a football match. Joe sees three men beating up Liam. Joe attempts to intervene. He helps Liam up and asks him if he is still clean. Liam states that he is. Liam confronts his wife when she comes home. He suspects that she has been using and asks her if she 'takes him for a prick.' Liam then yells that he will leave her to rot, grabs her by her neck and forces her to look at herself in the mirror. Joe then attends Liam's flat and encounters Liam's wife shooting up in the bathroom. An argument erupts between them. Joe offers to help her. She does not want the kind of help that Joe offers. Joe then reluctantly assists her to tie off one of her veins so that she can shoot up. Joe tries to make sense of her incoherent mumbles as she lies prostrate in the bathtub. Joe then goes to a snooker club where he asks after Liam's whereabouts. Joe tells one of the men that he encounters that Liam has a four-year-old boy in an attempt to mitigate matters. Liam says that he does not want them to take liberties. He comes across Liam and is cross because Liam told him that he had stopped dealing. A tearful Liam confesses that he still owes money. Joe also tells Liam that he suspects that his wife is on the game. He is worried that people are going to break his legs. Joe and Sarah prepare a meal together, which is interrupted when they have sex. The next day, Joe goes to Stella Maris' B & B in order to deal with the matter of Liam. In a later scene, Joe gives Sarah a pair of earrings, as well as a ring. Joe tells Sarah that he loves her. Sarah tells him that she does not want it and Joe cannot understand what he has done wrong. Joe is confused as to why Sarah has behaved in this fashion. In the next shot, we see a copy of the Alcoholics Anonymous' small blue Bible as Joe listens to Beethoven's Violin Concerto in D Major and makes notes in a book. When Sarah arrives at his door, she apologises. They drink tea together and later embrace. Joe drives his van and his mates direct him to a place where they rob another van. At the outset, Joe does not know where they are going. Joe is shocked with his unwitting role in the robbery of Astral Sports. He still acts as the get-away driver. At the next football match, Joe cleverly remarks that the other team look like budgies because of their blue and yellow striped uniforms. Meanwhile, Sarah reveals to her co-worker Maggie that she is pregnant. Maggie congratulates her. At Sarah's flat, she expresses her reservations about Joe's dealings with Liam. Joe tells her that there are some things that she does not need to know. Joe outlines the limited choices that Liam faces, most of which are not pleasant. Sarah accuses Joe of being a drug dealer and asks where he got the money for her earrings and ring. Joe replies that the gang gave him some money. Sarah becomes enraged and asks, 'Are you going to hit me too, Joe?' Joe attends Liam's flat and states that Liam must deal with things himself. Joe returns to his flat with bottles of Smirnoff Vodka. He pours himself a drink, and takes a sip. Liam then goes to Joe's flat, where Joe is very inebriated. Joe does not understand why Liam has come to see him. Joe calls Liam a 'stupid wee prick.' The alcohol has overtaken Joe and he is hostile to Liam, who needs his help. As Liam witnesses members of the gang coming towards the premises, Liam realises that Joe has passed out and he kisses Joe on his forehead. Joe suddenly snaps awake and realises that Liam has taken his own life by hanging himself. The film concludes with Liam's funeral.
6189444Unlucky plumber – Athanasius Borshchov   and his friend Fedulov  spend all day and night avoiding work and finding opportunities to drink. Afonya takes ""kickbacks"" from clients and is often in trouble with the local committee for his behaviour. Afonya meets plasterer Kolya  in a pub, gets drunk and comes home. When his girlfriend sees the state he's in, she leaves him. The next morning he can't even remember yesterday's drinking companion. Things continue to go downhill for Afonya. When student interns from the vocational school are allocated to the plumbers, master ZHEK Vostryakovo  doesn't allocate any to him, fearing that he will not teach them well. Afonya begs for trainees and gets two. Having worked with him for one day and having seen his attitude and working methods, the trainees refuse to work with him anymore. The next day, Kolya arrives to live at Afonya's, having been thrown out of his house by his wife. At a dance Afonya meets young nurse Katya Snegireva , who knows about him through her brother, who used to play in Afonya's volleyball team. Afonya doesn't pay her much attention, because he's more interested in older women and already has his eye on one at the dance. However, a romantic walk with the older woman after the dance is over before it begins – Afonya is challenged to a fight by a hooligan, who he'd quarrelled with at the dance. The hooligan's friends join in, and finish the unequal fight. Katya worries for Afonya's safety, and calls the militia - which will only bring Anfonya to the committee's attention again. At a regular work call Borshchov meets Helen  and falls in love at first sight. He starts finding any excuse to work in her flat - even fooling a tenant, astronomer , by swapping his new Finnish sink for an old one, so he can install the Finnish sink in Helen's home as a gift. In his dreams Athos sees a family idyll with his wife Helen and their perfect children. Katya Snegireva, head over heels for Afonya, keeps engineering new meetings with him, and stops at nothing to attract his attention: ""Athanasius! someone called, I thought it was – you ... "". Afonya is completely oblivious to her feelings. Meanwhile Afonya's run in with the militia catches up with him and, for persistent drunkenness, truancy and fighting Afonya is threatened with being sacked at a meeting of the local committee. In addition, if he doesn't restore the Finnish sink he's definitely going to be fired. Afonya takes a porcelain sink with flowers to Helen to swap with the Finnish sink, but meets Helen coming home with company. She makes her feelings quite clear: she has her own life among fashionable and wealthy men, and Afonya is just a plumber. Afonya, depressed, goes to a restaurant with Fedulov and tries to escape into drunkenness, but it doesn't help. In his drunken state he goes to Katya Snegireva's home and proposes marriage, and wakes up next to her in the morning. Katya tells him she's due to move to Africa with work and wonders if she should cancel for Afonya. Afonya then decides to go back to his village, to his aunt Frosya , who brought him up. In the village, he meets his childhood friend Concertina  and, in a joyous moment sends the city a telegram resigning from his job and giving up his apartment. Only then does he learn that Aunt Frosya died two years ago. Afonya's depression increases – he has lost everything and has nowhere to go. Neighbour Uncle Yegor  gives Athos his Aunt Frosya's legacy – savings account in his name, the deeds to her house, and the letters she'd sent to herself, pretending they were from Afonya to the neighbours . The guilt of having ignored her only increases his gloom. Athanasius goes to the post office and tries to call Katya Snegireva on her memorable phone number 50-50-2, or as he says himself, ""rug-rug or two."" The answer comes back - Katya has left. Finally frustrated, he goes to the airport. He does not care where he's going or what will happen to him. Things have gotten so bad that a local militia man has to be convinced Afonya is the man in his passport photograph, so grim has he gotten since it was taken. Finally, just when Athanasius is heading to the AN-2 aircraft , a familiar girlish voice calls out. It's Katya, suitcase in hand: ""Athanasius!, someone called, I thought it was – you ... "

1273501Early in the Second World War, a raiding party of six Nazi sailors, caught ashore when their U-boat is sunk in Hudson Bay, attempt to evade capture by travelling across Canada to the still-neutral United States. The film's title comes from the 49th parallel north which marks part of the border between the two countries. Led by Lieutenants Hirth  and Kuhnecke , the small band of sailors encounter and sometimes brutalize a wide range of people, including the Eskimo Nick , the French-Canadian trapper , the floatplane crew and local Eskimo onlookers, pacifistic German Hutterite farmers, an innocent motorist, and the eccentric English academic and author ([[Leslie Howard . Making their way across Canada first using a stolen seaplane, the five surviving members of the Nazi band try to stir up sympathy among the Hutterite community outside Winnipeg, believing them to be countrymen. Lieutenant Hirth's stirring speech is rejected by Peter , the community's leader, and even by one of their own, Vogel , who comes to the aid of Anna . Vogel is tried by Lieutenant Hirth and summarily executed for the greater crime of trying to break away from the Nazi group. Hijacking an innocent motorist for his automobile, Hirth, Lohrmann and Kranz flee West. With all of Canada searching for them, and having killed 11 civilians along the way, Lohrmann is arrested by Canadian Mounties at a public gathering. Next, Kranz  is knocked out cold by writer Phillip A-Scott  in a cave - despite having been wounded. Finally, the story comes to a head with a confrontation on a freight train between Hirth, the sole remaining fugitive at large, and AWOL Canadian soldier Andy Brock . When Hirth learns the train has crossed into the United States, he surrenders his gun to a customs official and demands to be taken to the German embassy in the U.S. . However, Brock points out that Hirth is locked in the freight hold, but is not listed on the freight manifest, and convinces both American customs officials instead, that the freight car together with Hirth and Brock be sent back to Canada as ""improperly manifested cargo"" - which they readily comply with. The film ends with the train reversing to Canada and Brock about to pummel Hirth in the boxcar.

13379536The book club is the brainchild of fiftysomething six-time divorcée Bernadette, who latches onto the idea when she meets Prudie, a prim, married high school French teacher in her mid-20s, at a Jane Austen film festival. Her concept is to have six members discuss all of Austen's six novels, with each member hosting the group once a month. Also inducted into the club are Sylvia, a fortysomething librarian who recently has separated from her philandering lawyer husband Daniel after more than two decades of marriage; Sylvia's 20-something lesbian daughter Allegra; Jocelyn, a happily unmarried control freak and breeder of Rhodesian Ridgebacks who has been Sylvia's friend since childhood; and Grigg, a science fiction fan who's roped into the group by Jocelyn with the hope he and Sylvia will prove to be a compatible match. As the months pass, each of the members develops characteristics similar to those of Austen's characters and reacts to events in their lives in much the same way their fictional counterparts would. Bernadette is the matriarch figure who longs to see everyone find happiness. Sylvia clings to her belief in steadfast love and devotion, and eventually reconciles with Daniel. Jocelyn denies her own feelings for Grigg while playing matchmaker for him and Sylvia. Prudie, encumbered with her inattentive husband Dean and a free-spirited, pot-smoking, aging-hippie mother, a product of the 1960s counterculture, finds herself desperately trying not to succumb to her feelings for her seductive student Trey. Allegra, who tends to meet her lovers while engaging in death-defying activities, feels betrayed when she discovers her current partner, aspiring writer Corinne, has used Allegra's life as the basis for her short stories. Grigg is attracted to Jocelyn and mystified by her seeming lack of interest in him, marked by her failure to read the Ursula K. Le Guin novels he has hoped will catch her fancy. He also serves as the comedic foil to Jocelyn and Prudie's very serious takes on the books.

22778879The original plot is more-or-less adhered to, with some significant alterations. Benny is depicted as a comic Bob Hope-like coward, but not as a sissy. El Khobar's alter ego is that of a mild-mannered  Latin tutor and anthropologist, whom Birabeau hires to keep Margot from flirting with his regiment. The conclusion to the film is slightly different, since El Khobar is not Birabeau's son here. After the final battle, the General's soldiers realize that El Khobar and the Riffs were actually on their side and helped in preventing an uprising. When one asks, ""And where is El Khobar?"", MacRae, as the professor, enters carrying El Khobar's clothes, and quietly announces ""El Khobar is dead"". Margot is grief-stricken, but Birabeau, suspecting the truth, mischievously says that they can all be grateful to ""the ghost of El Khobar"", winking as he says this. As soon as they are alone, MacRae begins to sing the song One Alone to Margot, making her realize that her boring Latin tutor and the dashing El Khobar are one and the same. She rushes into his arms.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stidFull%20Synopsis One song not by Romberg, Gay Parisienne, written for the 1943 film version of the show, is retained for this film.
1937542Living In Oblivion is divided into three parts, all of which concern the making of a low-budget movie featuring the same director, crew and substantially the same cast. Part one: Director Nick Reve  is shooting a low-budget independent film in the middle of New York City. The catering crew are under-funded and apathetic, deciding not to replace a carton of milk that has been on the craft service table for a week. The scene being shot is a difficult one: a young woman, Ellen, reproaches her elderly mother  for not intervening when the father beat Ellen as a child. However, on the set, just about everything that can go wrong does go wrong: shots are spoiled because of the mic boom is visible; the camera assistant fails to keep the shot in focus; Cora, the actress playing the mother, forgets her lines; and Nicole, the actress playing Ellen, becomes increasingly unfocused and careless. A dispirited Nick calls for a rehearsal without camera to refresh the actors. However, when Nicole  berates herself for acting badly, Cora  reassures her with a gesture that reminds Nicole of a similar gesture made by her own terminally ill mother. Nicole is so upset by the memory that she turns in an unexpectedly passionate performance; and Cora, startled by Nicole's sudden intensity, is equally good. Watching them, Nick becomes enthusiastic all over again. Unfortunately, it was not captured on film; cinematographer and camera operator Wolf , who has been diluting the sub-standard coffee with the spoiled milk, was vomiting in the toilet throughout. Nick ruefully calls for another take. This time, a sudden and insistent beeping sound distracts the actors. Nobody can tell where it's coming from; and Nick flies into a rage, berating everyone on the crew and cast for their inadequacies. He then wakes up in his own bed; the beeping sound was his own alarm clock. He has dreamed the entire segment. It is 4.30am; and he is due on set. Part two: Early the same morning, the film's lead actor Chad Palomino  is getting dressed in Nicole's hotel room. They have spent the night together, and Chad suggests that they might get together again later; Nicole politely declines. Chad and Nicole arrive on the set separately. Nicole's character Ellen and Chad's character Damian have been in love for years but have never admitted it until the scene being shot on this day. Shooting the scene is made practically impossible by Chad's irregular acting. He keeps changing his mind about where to stand and continually moves to places where he is either invisible or badly lit by scenic light. Nicole becomes increasingly frustrated by Chad's egomania; and, when he starts to stroke her head, she briefly loses her cool, then apologizes. An irritated Chad demands a private talk with Nick. He tells Nick that he has slept with Nicole and makes out that it was she, not he, who had wanted to continue the relationship. Desperate to keep Chad happy, Nick agrees that Nicole is not very good. Nicole overhears this conversation on the sound mixer's headphones. Pretending to be contrite, she asks Nick if they can improvise a little; but, when they do so, she announces to everyone that, although she slept with Chad, she is not at all interested in him. Chad loses his temper and quits the movie. Relieved that he will no longer have to please Chad, Nick calls him a ""Hostess Twinkie motherfucker"" and a fight breaks out. Nick beats Chad senseless and fires him. He apologises to Nicole and confesses that he loves her. They kiss—then Nicole abruptly wakes up, still in her bed, having dreamed the whole thing. Part three: Later the same day, the crew is setting up for a dream sequence in which Nicole, as Ellen, stands still while a dwarf walks around her holding an apple. Nick claims to have learned a lesson from his own dream: That sometimes, ""you just got to roll with things."" Nicole admits that she had a dream with Nick in it but doesn't tell him what happened. Nick manages to keep up his positive attitude despite the various mishaps that occur: The smoke machine fails to work, then it catches fire, then his senile mother Cora arrives on the set. However, the ill-tempered dwarf actor Tito  complains that the dream sequence is a cliché  and walks off the set in disgust. Nick's confidence collapses, and he announces that the movie is over. At that moment, his mother intervenes, grabbing the apple, moving to Tito's mark and announcing that she is ""ready"". The crew scrambles to shoot the scene, and her manic performance injects fresh energy and conviction into it. Nick is delighted and decides to keep the new dream sequence, and there is a tense moment while the sound mixer records 30 seconds of room tone. The entire cast and crew manages to remain silent, and they go on to shooting the next sequence.
31555231In flashback, Niall , a local news reporter, recalls visiting his mother's grave, as he smartens up in a toilet mirror. His colleague Tammy  knocks on the toilet door to hurry him up and as they walk to the car she instructs him on the art of the 'death-knock': knocking on the doors of the recently bereaved to obtain quotes and pictures of the deceased for the newspaper. Niall's poor track record has put his job on the line and Tammy has been detailed to improve his hit-rate. When they reach the house of Mrs Wright, who has lost her son in a car accident, Niall goes in first while Tammy waits outside. Before Niall can introduce himself and launch into his spiel that Tammy has prepared for him, Mrs Wright  interrupts him - ""I know who you are"" - and ushers him into the house. There she ropes him into unstacking the dishwasher as Niall tries in vain to broach the subject of the bereavement against the sound of a fire alarm which has been set off by the cigarette Mrs Wright is smoking. Mrs Wright appears baffled by Niall's requests for pictures and instead offers him some soup telling him they will look at some pictures ""in the morning"", much to Niall's surprise. She then leads him upstairs to the bedroom and encourages him to get some rest. Trapped in the bedroom, Niall examines the dead boy's belongings and finds himself playing with his toys. Meanwhile, Tammy waits outside taking a phone call from her boss at the newspaper, to whom she explains that Niall ""is still in there, so he must be doing alright"". Whilst playing with a light sabre, Niall knocks off a shelf-load of items and as he picks them up, he finds a photo of the dead boy. Mrs Wright, alerted by the noise, appears behind him and embracing Niall, she tells him: ""it's been a long day: time for bed."" Tammy knocks at the door and attempts to talk to Mrs Wright about the accident in which her son was killed, but Mrs Wright replies that her son is in his room and that there must be some mistake. Closing the door, she is nonetheless shaken by Tammy's insistence that her son is dead and she climbs the stairs to the bedroom where she finds Niall tucked up fast asleep in her son's bed. She kisses him on the cheek and switches out the light.
384141The story revolves around a farmer Shambu Mahato , who lives with his wife Parvati `Paro’  and son Kanhaiya  in a small village that has been hit badly by a famine. After years of drought, the region finally gets rain, leading to the farmers to rejoice. Shambu owns two bighas  of land, which is the only means of livelihood for the whole family. The local zamindar  Thakur Harnam Singh ([[Murad  partners with some city business men to construct a mill on his large parcel of land, which in return would profit them and bring prosperity to the village. The only problem is that in the middle of Harnam singh's land lay Shambu's meager two bighas of land. Harnam Singh is very confident that he could buy Shambu's land. Shambu has borrowed money from Harnam Singh several times in the past and has not paid back his debt. Harnam Singh calls for Shambu and proposes Shambu to sell his land to him in exchange for his debt. Shambu disagrees to sell his only livelihood and Harnam Singh gets upset. Harnam Singh orders him to pay back his debt by the next day or risk auctioning his land. Shambu comes back home to discuss the issue with his father, and with the help of his son, they figure out that the debt amounts to 65 rupees. Shambu wants to save his land by all means and sells all his household items including his wife's gold earrings. When Shambu meets Harman Singh's accountant to pay back his debt of 65 rupees, he's shocked to know that he actually owes 235 rupees. The accountant had forged the accounts and now refuses to consider the labor provided by Shambu's father Gangu as portion of debt payoff. The case goes to court and Shambu being an illiterate, has a tough time explaining to the judge how the accountant forged the numbers and how he took accountant's word of mouth and did not demand any receipt. Shambu loses the case, however the judge orders Shambu to pay back 235 rupees to Harnam Singh in three months. If Shambu is not able to pay back his debt, then his land would be auctioned off and the proceeds would go to pay off his debts. Shambu now struggles to get the money and he is unable to get a loan because he has no collaterals. One of his village friends gives him an idea to go to Calcutta  and try to get a job to earn enough money to pay off his debt. Shambu likes this idea, but faces resistance from his wife as she's pregnant and does not want to live away from him. Shambu persuades her that he'll be gone for three months only and it would benefit his family and the new born baby. Kanhaiya wants to join his father too, but Shambu refuses and scolds him. On the train to Calcutta, Shambu finds Kanhaiya hiding and hitchhiking with him and after a brief confrontation agrees to take Kanhaiya with him. In Calcutta, Shambu and Kanhaiya face a harsh welcome. Nobody is willing to talk with them, let alone help them. Kanhaiya befriends a street side shoe shiner named Lalu `Ustad’ . They hope for no prospective and even loose their last possessions while they are asleep on the street sides.

Back in the village, Parvati and Gangu survive on eating water chestnuts picked up from the local river. She's seeks help from Bahu  to write letters to Shambu and stay in touch. As the three months end date nears by, Shambu becomes aggressive about earning and saving more money. One day, a man asks Shambu to chase another rickshaw that is carrying his girlfriend. Shambu is insisted to pull the rickshaw very fast for more money. The rickshaw loses a wheel and Shambu meets with an accident. Looking at the condition of his father, Kanhaiya joins a pick pocketer in order to earn quick money. Shambu gets mad and beats Kanhaiya when he comes to know about his dirty earnings. Meanwhile, Parvati gets worried since she receives no letters or money from Shambu and the Zamindar's accountant accuses Shambu that he has forgotten his family. She ends up working on a local construction site and gets devastated when she receives the news that Shambu has met with an accident. Finally, Parvati decides to visit Shambu in the city even though Gangu is on bed rest suffering of high fever. Parvati arrives in Calcutta, and is taken by a strange man, who claims he knows Shambu and will take her to him. He takes her to his shed and tries to steal and force her. She flees from him, but comes under a car. The crowd gathers around her and they call for a rickshaw to take her to the hospital.

20841547Somewhere in Beverly Hills, in the house of Jack Benny , a mouse version of Jack is practicing his violin---off key---and saying to himself, ""Who is this guy Isaac Stern?""  Outside Jack's mouse hole, a cat is lying in wait, wearing ear muffs to filter out the discordant sound of Jack's violin. Jack calls his servant, Rochester  to get his white suit, which Rochester is wearing at the time. Jack tells the valet that his rental period is up  and he needs the suit because he is taking Mary Livingstone out for her birthday, and, true to character, is looking for a good cheap restaurant. While waiting for Mary, Jack decides to count his cheese in a basement vault. Using a coin on a string, he opens the lock, which appears to be a coin-operated lock from a pay toilet. As soon as he walks through the door, he takes a cane from a nail on the wall and starts humming We're in the Money. When he reaches the bottom of the stairs, he reaches through a hole and trips a razor blade hanging above the passageway like a guillotine. He then comes up to a derringer and uses the cane to trip the trigger on the derringer. Finally, he comes up to another hole, reaches through with the cane and trips a mousetrap. He then reaches the vault door, opens a combination lock, pulls the door open and numerous sound effects including various alarms, a foghorn and machine gun noises are heard. Ed, the vault guard, asks ""who goes there?"", and then an exchange is heard where Ed, apparently having been in the vault for a long time, asks ""did we win the war yet?"" When Benny assures Ed that the war had been won, thinking that Ed was referring to World War II, Ed says: ""That's good. What do you think we'll do with the Kaiser?"" Mary arrives while Jack is inspecting his cheese vault, and he emerges wondering who has been pilfering his gorgonzola. A fat rodent version of Don Wilson attempts to deliver a commercial when Jack advises him that this is a movie and not a television program. When Mary suggests a place, Jack's eyes ring up like an old cash register with a dollar sign  and ""no sale"", they discuss other options. As they were discussing the options, the cat writes a message extolling the ""Kit Kat Club""  and sends it to Jack as a paper airplane. Jack and Mary putter off in his Maxwell with Rochester behind the wheel until they reach the Kit Kat Club by following the arrows pointing to it. While enroute, Mary asks for champagne, while Jack says that he prefers a good ""mousecatel"". Unbeknownst to them, the ""club"" is actually the maw of a real cat, and as they enter, the cat's mouth closes on them. Jack cries: ""Help! Help!"" as the camera cuts to the live-action Jack Benny, who wakes up and, breaking the fourth wall, tells the audience: ""Gosh, what a crazy dream! Imagine- Mary and me as two little mice trapped inside a cat's mouth! And me playing the violin!"" At that point, Jack is interrupted by the sound of a discordant ""Rock-a-Bye Baby"" played on the violin, coming from within Jack's live-action cat. From there, the rodent versions of Jack and Mary emerge unharmed from the live-action cat. Following one last bit of animation , the real Jack Benny does one of his famous ""takes"" as the cartoon fades out.
1730420While driving cross-country from Boston to San Diego in their new Jeep Grand Cherokee, Jeff Taylor and his wife Amy narrowly miss colliding with a beat-up Ford F-150 that darts in front of them from an connecting road on a deserted highway. Later, while stopped at a gas station, the truck's driver, Earl, exchanges hostile words with Jeff before the couple resume their journey. Shortly afterwards, their Jeep breaks down in the middle of the desert. Leaving Jeff with the car, Amy accepts a ride from a passing big-rig trucker named Red Barr driving a Peterbilt 385, to get to a nearby diner and call for help. Jeff eventually discovers that the Jeep's battery connections have been suspiciously tampered with, and, after reconnecting them, drives to the diner, only to find that no one has seen his wife. When he catches up with Barr on the road and forces him to stop, the trucker claims he has never seen Jeff or his wife before. Jeff hails a passing sheriff, named Boyd, but a brief search of Barr's truck yields no sign of Amy, and he is let go. Jeff then goes to a police station where he is advised by a deputy to go back to the diner and wait for his wife. There Jeff meets with a simpleton mechanic named Billy, who says he saw Amy arrive in one truck and leave in another. He tells Jeff where they have taken her, but refuses to speak with the police, thinking that they are involved. Jeff heads to the location Billy mentioned, but is ambushed on a back road by Earl, and escapes by driving his Jeep into a river. Abandoning the Jeep and later circling back to watch his attackers salvage the Jeep from the water, Jeff is discovered and knocked out by Billy, an accomplice who had feigned mental impairment earlier. Jeff awakens in a car trunk surrounded by Earl, Billy, another accomplice, Al, a tow-truck driver, and their leader, Red Barr. Red tells Jeff that his wife will be released in exchange for $90,000 that the kidnappers think Jeff has in his bank account. Knowing that he only has a small fraction of the assumed amount, Jeff enters a nearby bank to withdraw what little money he has. After a failed attempt to alert the bank manager to his danger, Jeff steals marked money ribbons and a letter opener from the manager's desk; Jeff uses money ribbons to packet $1 bills in-between two $100 bills, fooling the kidnappers. With the ransom now in hand, Jeff is then instructed by phone to leave town, where he is picked up and bound with duct tape by Earl in his pickup truck. While gloating about how easy Jeff and his wife were to abduct by rigging their car to break down after leaving the gas station, as well as bragging that he intends to kill Jeff and his wife anyway, Earl discovers Jeff's ruse with the ransom. At exactly the same moment, Jeff frees himself and stabs Earl in the chest with the letter opener. After a struggle in the speeding, swerving pickup, Jeff takes over the vehicle, bounds Earl, and forces him to reveal his rendezvous with Red at a local truck stop. Sheriff Boyd appears in his patrol car and, seeing the swerving pickup, calls for backup and stops the vehicle. After Jeff exits the truck with Earl's pistol in hand, a stressed Boyd mistakes the situation and forces Jeff at gunpoint down onto the road. Earl frees himself and shoots Boyd with another pistol concealed in his boot. Just as Earl is about to shoot Jeff, a wounded Boyd shoots and kills Earl. Jeff uses Boyd's radio to call for an ambulance and heads to the truck stop Earl mentioned. At the rest stop, Jeff avoids the police looking for him in connection to the shooting of Boyd, and then spots Red talking on a payphone with another accomplice. Jeff follows Red to his truck where he jumps under the moving truck as Red drives away. Jeff loses his pistol while climbing aboard, but stows away to Red's farm at which he arrives early the next morning. Hiding in a barn, Jeff watches as Red and his remaining accomplices take a bound and gagged Amy and lock her in a freezer in the barn's cellar, leaving her to die. Unable to open the locked cellar door, Jeff finds a gun in Red's truck and uses it to hold Red, his accomplices, and his wife and son at gunpoint, demands the cellar key. Billy escapes, but Jeff forces the rest of the group to safely release Amy from the freezer before locking them in the cellar. Jeff and Amy then flee in a stolen Chevrolet C-20 pickup, while Billy frees Red and Al. They pursue the Taylors in their respective vehicles. During the climactic chase, Billy is killed in a fiery crash when Jeff forces his car off the road, while the trailer from Red's truck detaches, causing Al to violently crash into it. Undeterred, Red attempts to ram Jeff's vehicle off a bridge, trapping Amy's leg underneath the dashboard. Red's big rig nearly falls off the edge and becomes suspended by a steel bridge support. Jeff battles Red on the suspended big rig, eventually hurling Red to the rocks below. Jeff frees Amy from the dashboard in which she  pulls the automatic shift on their pickup, causing the semi to fall on Red and crush him. Sitting on the edge of the bridge beside their mangled pickup truck, Jeff and Amy embrace each other.

12064359 The film is presented as found footage from a personal video camera recovered by the United States Department of Defense. A disclaimer text states that the footage is of a case designated ""Cloverfield"" and was found in the area ""formerly known as Central Park"". The video consists chiefly of segments taped the night of Friday, May 22, 2009. The newer segments were taped over older video that is shown occasionally. The first video segment opens when Rob wakes up on the morning of Monday, April 27 having slept with Beth, a previously platonic friend. They make plans to go to Coney Island that day. The footage cuts to May 22, when Rob's brother Jason and his girlfriend Lily prepare a farewell party for Rob who will be moving to Japan. Their friend Hud uses the camera to film testimonials. After Beth leaves the party, an apparent earthquake strikes, and the city suffers a brief power outage. The local news reports that an oil tanker has capsized near Liberty Island. When the party-goers leave the building, they see the head of the Statue of Liberty crash into the street with several stunning scratch and bite marks. Hud records what appears to be a hand of a large creature several blocks away. The monster causes the Woolworth Building to collapse.

The monster falls, then lunges at the helicopter, causing it to crash into Central Park.  The film skips to less than an hour later, with a voice on the crashed helicopter's radio warning that the Hammer Down protocol will begin in 15 minutes. The three friends regain consciousness and flee the helicopter. As they leave, the monster kills Hud. Rob and Beth grab the camera and take shelter under Greyshot Arch in Central Park as air raid sirens begin to blare and bombing starts. Rob and Beth take turns leaving their last testimonies of the day, which Rob mentions as Saturday, May 23. The bridge crumbles and debris covers the camera.According to the ""military intelligence"" in the special investigation mode of the Blu-ray version, this was the only thing that protected the camera during the Hammer Down protocol The film then cuts to the footage of Rob and Beth's Coney Island date on April 27. In the distance, unnoticed by Rob and Beth, a large object falls into the ocean.

384990Ann  lives in Baton Rouge. She is unhappily married to John  and has never experienced an orgasm. She is seeing a counselor for her problems. Graham Dalton  is an old college friend of John's. He is now a seeming drifter who, after nine years, returns to live in Baton Rouge. Graham arrives to find Ann, who has no idea that John has invited Graham to stay with them until he finds an apartment. When John arrives home, Graham's demeanor becomes remarkably more guarded, due in large part to John's overt disapproval of Graham's bohemian persona. They also discuss the fact that Graham's college girlfriend, Elizabeth, is also living in Baton Rouge. John is sleeping with Ann's sister, Cynthia , a free-spirited bartender. He rationalizes it by blaming Ann's frigidity. He frequently leaves his law office mid-day to meet with Cynthia, instructing his secretary to reschedule clients who are already in the lobby waiting to see him. Ann makes an impromptu visit to Graham's apartment, where she notices stacks of camcorder tapes around the television. When pressed, Graham explains that he interviews women about their sexual experiences and fantasies, on videotape. Ann, overcome with shock and confusion, flees his apartment. Within a day, Cynthia appears at Graham's apartment and introduces herself. Cynthia presses Graham to explain what ""spooked"" Ann the preceding day. Graham explains the videotapes, and admits to Cynthia his sexual dysfunction: that he is impotent when in the presence of another person, and that he achieves gratification by watching these videos in private. Graham propositions Cynthia to make a tape, assuring her that no other person is allowed to see the tapes. She believes him, and agrees. Cynthia reports back to Ann, who is horrified. Cynthia also tells John. When Ann discovers Cynthia's pearl earring in her bedroom, she is furious. She heads over to Graham's apartment with the intention of making a videotape. Graham objects, telling her it is something she would not do in a normal frame of mind. She insists and Graham relents. Afterward, Ann demands a divorce from John. In the ensuing argument, John gleans that Ann has been to Graham's, and that she made a video. He hits Graham and locks him out of the house, then watches Ann's tape. In it, Ann says she has never felt any kind of 'satisfaction' from sex. After Graham asks if she ever thinks of having sex with other men, she admits she has thought of Graham. Ann later turns the camera on Graham. Graham confesses that he is haunted by Elizabeth, and that his motivation in returning to Baton Rouge is a vague notion of reconnecting with her.

1430058The film begins with Joe Kavanagh at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, relaying an experience from his past. He states the ritualised greeting: 'My name is Joe and I'm an alcoholic.' He feels that he is not in a position to drink anymore with safety. He tells the group that he copes by praying and states that he is grateful to be at the meeting. He receives a round of applause for his admissions. He goes round to his friend's place, bangs on the door and pretends to be the police. His friends soon realise that they have been tricked. They then travel in Joe's van where they examine stolen sporting merchandise which is of low quality. Joe and his friends stop at another person's house in order to pick up more people. A car cuts off the van. Joe later encounters the driver, whom Joe later describes as being 'the woman who tried to kill us all.' He exits his van and asks the woman if she lost her guide dog. The woman, Sarah, states that she is a health visitor. She wants to see Liam and his child, but Joe explains that Liam has an important football game to attend. The next shot is of the football match. Joe is very encouraging as a coach. The other team appears in white and black, which are the colours that Joe's team wears. Joe's team express their anger at this and respond by taking their shirts off so that they are able to distinguish between players. The other team scores the first goal of the game. Joe drives Liam home and tells Liam to take things one day at a time. Liam abruptly tells Joe to pull over and Liam runs up to a male who acts aggressively towards him. Joe does not hear what transpires between Liam and the man. Later, Joe sees Sarah, who is seen struggling with wallpaper in her car. Joe appears to fancy her, as Sarah tells him her name and he flirts with her. Joe then helps an acquaintance of Sarah's to complete a wall papering and paint job in Sarah's flat. Sarah then leaves the lads to it. She later brings them tea as they paint the ceiling and sing to themselves. They then look outside and notice someone taking photos of them through the window. Joe runs outside with his can of white paint and brush to confront the man who was taking the photos. The photographer tells Joe that he was just doing his job and that he has a bad heart. Joe then paints all over the photographer's car. The car speeds away and manages to knock over a pile of rubbish by the side of the road. Later, Sarah and Joe have dinner together. They are able to make comfortable conversation with one another. There is a bottle of red wine on the table, but Joe does not drink any of the alcohol. Sarah's telephone rings and she leaves the kitchen to answer it. Joe is then left alone with the wine. He clears his plate and appears somewhat nervous. When Sarah finishes with her telephone conversation, Joe asks her about the photographs on her wall. Joe later reveals to Sarah that he does not drink, to which Sarah replies: 'Why didn't you say?' Joe reveals that he is an alcoholic and he has not had a drink in ten months. Joe is happy that Sarah knows and that she has been direct in her responses to him. Joe thanks Sarah for her company. Sarah pays Joe for the work that he completed on her flat and they part company. Joe attends the Mayfield Health Centre. The practice is very busy and the receptionist tries to cope with a patient who is complaining because he has been waiting a long time in order to receive his prescription. Joe tells the receptionist that he would like to see Sarah. The receptionist does not appear to be surprised by his request and says that Joe is free to pop his head around the door. He sees Sarah advising parents on dealing with the changing of nappies. Outside the Health Centre, Joe asks Sarah if she would like to go ten-pin bowling with him and to ring him if she fancies going. They then part company. Sarah speaks with a female colleague, Maggie, and says that Joe seems a bit wild. She states that she is not going to go bowling with Joe. The next shot is of a bowling alley, with 'Spirit in the Sky' playing in the background. Sarah and Joe bowl together and laugh at their many errors. They occupy Aisle 16 and neither of them are spectacular players. They go back to Sarah's place where she asks him in for a cup of tea. Joe politely says no. Sarah offers him money for a taxi. A friendly argument ensues, at the end of which Sarah finds herself locked out of her flat. Sarah says that she can sleep in her car. Joe states that Sarah can sleep at his place, but not necessarily together. They arrive at Joe's and he shows her around his flat. While Joe makes tea for Sarah, she asks him if it is alright to put some music on. She puts on the same piece of music that the audience heard during the opening credits of the film, Beethoven's Violin Concerto in D Major. Joe tells Sarah that he used to be in a band and they won a local talent contest. Joe tells Sarah a story of how he was desperate for a drink one day and what transpired. He went to a music shop and stole some cassettes. He took one of them home and 'got pissed.' He describes the experience as being 'magical.' When Sarah asks him what made him stop drinking, Joe asks her why she wants to know. He is not hostile, but curious. Joe says that he is scared to tell her and that there is a strong chance that she will hate him if he tells. Joe explains that there was a girl he used to drink with and they loved one another. They were both 'just tangled up' and they used to get into terrible arguments and tear one another apart. The audience then sees a flashback where Joe and the girl are returning home from a night out. He states that 'a cloud just descended... really, really dark. And suddenly I hated her. I hated me.' He describes how he tried to open the door, but was unable to; when the partner whom he was with laughed at him, Joe lost control because she found it funny. He beat her by punching and kicking her, while she lay helpless on the ground. He screamed abuse at her. The next day, he had a blackout. Now, he remembers every punch and kick. He states how ashamed and disgusted he is with himself. He is obviously contrite and he has not yet forgiven himself for his actions. In the next shot, Sarah comforts Joe and tells him that it is okay. The next scene is of a football match. Joe sees three men beating up Liam. Joe attempts to intervene. He helps Liam up and asks him if he is still clean. Liam states that he is. Liam confronts his wife when she comes home. He suspects that she has been using and asks her if she 'takes him for a prick.' Liam then yells that he will leave her to rot, grabs her by her neck and forces her to look at herself in the mirror. Joe then attends Liam's flat and encounters Liam's wife shooting up in the bathroom. An argument erupts between them. Joe offers to help her. She does not want the kind of help that Joe offers. Joe then reluctantly assists her to tie off one of her veins so that she can shoot up. Joe tries to make sense of her incoherent mumbles as she lies prostrate in the bathtub. Joe then goes to a snooker club where he asks after Liam's whereabouts. Joe tells one of the men that he encounters that Liam has a four-year-old boy in an attempt to mitigate matters. Liam says that he does not want them to take liberties. He comes across Liam and is cross because Liam told him that he had stopped dealing. A tearful Liam confesses that he still owes money. Joe also tells Liam that he suspects that his wife is on the game. He is worried that people are going to break his legs. Joe and Sarah prepare a meal together, which is interrupted when they have sex. The next day, Joe goes to Stella Maris' B & B in order to deal with the matter of Liam. In a later scene, Joe gives Sarah a pair of earrings, as well as a ring. Joe tells Sarah that he loves her. Sarah tells him that she does not want it and Joe cannot understand what he has done wrong. Joe is confused as to why Sarah has behaved in this fashion. In the next shot, we see a copy of the Alcoholics Anonymous' small blue Bible as Joe listens to Beethoven's Violin Concerto in D Major and makes notes in a book. When Sarah arrives at his door, she apologises. They drink tea together and later embrace. Joe drives his van and his mates direct him to a place where they rob another van. At the outset, Joe does not know where they are going. Joe is shocked with his unwitting role in the robbery of Astral Sports. He still acts as the get-away driver. At the next football match, Joe cleverly remarks that the other team look like budgies because of their blue and yellow striped uniforms. Meanwhile, Sarah reveals to her co-worker Maggie that she is pregnant. Maggie congratulates her. At Sarah's flat, she expresses her reservations about Joe's dealings with Liam. Joe tells her that there are some things that she does not need to know. Joe outlines the limited choices that Liam faces, most of which are not pleasant. Sarah accuses Joe of being a drug dealer and asks where he got the money for her earrings and ring. Joe replies that the gang gave him some money. Sarah becomes enraged and asks, 'Are you going to hit me too, Joe?' Joe attends Liam's flat and states that Liam must deal with things himself. Joe returns to his flat with bottles of Smirnoff Vodka. He pours himself a drink, and takes a sip. Liam then goes to Joe's flat, where Joe is very inebriated. Joe does not understand why Liam has come to see him. Joe calls Liam a 'stupid wee prick.' The alcohol has overtaken Joe and he is hostile to Liam, who needs his help. As Liam witnesses members of the gang coming towards the premises, Liam realises that Joe has passed out and he kisses Joe on his forehead. Joe suddenly snaps awake and realises that Liam has taken his own life by hanging himself. The film concludes with Liam's funeral.
6189444Unlucky plumber – Athanasius Borshchov   and his friend Fedulov  spend all day and night avoiding work and finding opportunities to drink. Afonya takes ""kickbacks"" from clients and is often in trouble with the local committee for his behaviour. Afonya meets plasterer Kolya  in a pub, gets drunk and comes home. When his girlfriend sees the state he's in, she leaves him. The next morning he can't even remember yesterday's drinking companion. Things continue to go downhill for Afonya. When student interns from the vocational school are allocated to the plumbers, master ZHEK Vostryakovo  doesn't allocate any to him, fearing that he will not teach them well. Afonya begs for trainees and gets two. Having worked with him for one day and having seen his attitude and working methods, the trainees refuse to work with him anymore. The next day, Kolya arrives to live at Afonya's, having been thrown out of his house by his wife. At a dance Afonya meets young nurse Katya Snegireva , who knows about him through her brother, who used to play in Afonya's volleyball team. Afonya doesn't pay her much attention, because he's more interested in older women and already has his eye on one at the dance. However, a romantic walk with the older woman after the dance is over before it begins – Afonya is challenged to a fight by a hooligan, who he'd quarrelled with at the dance. The hooligan's friends join in, and finish the unequal fight. Katya worries for Afonya's safety, and calls the militia - which will only bring Anfonya to the committee's attention again. At a regular work call Borshchov meets Helen  and falls in love at first sight. He starts finding any excuse to work in her flat - even fooling a tenant, astronomer , by swapping his new Finnish sink for an old one, so he can install the Finnish sink in Helen's home as a gift. In his dreams Athos sees a family idyll with his wife Helen and their perfect children. Katya Snegireva, head over heels for Afonya, keeps engineering new meetings with him, and stops at nothing to attract his attention: ""Athanasius! someone called, I thought it was – you ... "". Afonya is completely oblivious to her feelings. Meanwhile Afonya's run in with the militia catches up with him and, for persistent drunkenness, truancy and fighting Afonya is threatened with being sacked at a meeting of the local committee. In addition, if he doesn't restore the Finnish sink he's definitely going to be fired. Afonya takes a porcelain sink with flowers to Helen to swap with the Finnish sink, but meets Helen coming home with company. She makes her feelings quite clear: she has her own life among fashionable and wealthy men, and Afonya is just a plumber. Afonya, depressed, goes to a restaurant with Fedulov and tries to escape into drunkenness, but it doesn't help. In his drunken state he goes to Katya Snegireva's home and proposes marriage, and wakes up next to her in the morning. Katya tells him she's due to move to Africa with work and wonders if she should cancel for Afonya. Afonya then decides to go back to his village, to his aunt Frosya , who brought him up. In the village, he meets his childhood friend Concertina  and, in a joyous moment sends the city a telegram resigning from his job and giving up his apartment. Only then does he learn that Aunt Frosya died two years ago. Afonya's depression increases – he has lost everything and has nowhere to go. Neighbour Uncle Yegor  gives Athos his Aunt Frosya's legacy – savings account in his name, the deeds to her house, and the letters she'd sent to herself, pretending they were from Afonya to the neighbours . The guilt of having ignored her only increases his gloom. Athanasius goes to the post office and tries to call Katya Snegireva on her memorable phone number 50-50-2, or as he says himself, ""rug-rug or two."" The answer comes back - Katya has left. Finally frustrated, he goes to the airport. He does not care where he's going or what will happen to him. Things have gotten so bad that a local militia man has to be convinced Afonya is the man in his passport photograph, so grim has he gotten since it was taken. Finally, just when Athanasius is heading to the AN-2 aircraft , a familiar girlish voice calls out. It's Katya, suitcase in hand: ""Athanasius!, someone called, I thought it was – you ... "

1273501Early in the Second World War, a raiding party of six Nazi sailors, caught ashore when their U-boat is sunk in Hudson Bay, attempt to evade capture by travelling across Canada to the still-neutral United States. The film's title comes from the 49th parallel north which marks part of the border between the two countries. Led by Lieutenants Hirth  and Kuhnecke , the small band of sailors encounter and sometimes brutalize a wide range of people, including the Eskimo Nick , the French-Canadian trapper , the floatplane crew and local Eskimo onlookers, pacifistic German Hutterite farmers, an innocent motorist, and the eccentric English academic and author ([[Leslie Howard . Making their way across Canada first using a stolen seaplane, the five surviving members of the Nazi band try to stir up sympathy among the Hutterite community outside Winnipeg, believing them to be countrymen. Lieutenant Hirth's stirring speech is rejected by Peter , the community's leader, and even by one of their own, Vogel , who comes to the aid of Anna . Vogel is tried by Lieutenant Hirth and summarily executed for the greater crime of trying to break away from the Nazi group. Hijacking an innocent motorist for his automobile, Hirth, Lohrmann and Kranz flee West. With all of Canada searching for them, and having killed 11 civilians along the way, Lohrmann is arrested by Canadian Mounties at a public gathering. Next, Kranz  is knocked out cold by writer Phillip A-Scott  in a cave - despite having been wounded. Finally, the story comes to a head with a confrontation on a freight train between Hirth, the sole remaining fugitive at large, and AWOL Canadian soldier Andy Brock . When Hirth learns the train has crossed into the United States, he surrenders his gun to a customs official and demands to be taken to the German embassy in the U.S. . However, Brock points out that Hirth is locked in the freight hold, but is not listed on the freight manifest, and convinces both American customs officials instead, that the freight car together with Hirth and Brock be sent back to Canada as ""improperly manifested cargo"" - which they readily comply with. The film ends with the train reversing to Canada and Brock about to pummel Hirth in the boxcar.

13379536The book club is the brainchild of fiftysomething six-time divorcée Bernadette, who latches onto the idea when she meets Prudie, a prim, married high school French teacher in her mid-20s, at a Jane Austen film festival. Her concept is to have six members discuss all of Austen's six novels, with each member hosting the group once a month. Also inducted into the club are Sylvia, a fortysomething librarian who recently has separated from her philandering lawyer husband Daniel after more than two decades of marriage; Sylvia's 20-something lesbian daughter Allegra; Jocelyn, a happily unmarried control freak and breeder of Rhodesian Ridgebacks who has been Sylvia's friend since childhood; and Grigg, a science fiction fan who's roped into the group by Jocelyn with the hope he and Sylvia will prove to be a compatible match. As the months pass, each of the members develops characteristics similar to those of Austen's characters and reacts to events in their lives in much the same way their fictional counterparts would. Bernadette is the matriarch figure who longs to see everyone find happiness. Sylvia clings to her belief in steadfast love and devotion, and eventually reconciles with Daniel. Jocelyn denies her own feelings for Grigg while playing matchmaker for him and Sylvia. Prudie, encumbered with her inattentive husband Dean and a free-spirited, pot-smoking, aging-hippie mother, a product of the 1960s counterculture, finds herself desperately trying not to succumb to her feelings for her seductive student Trey. Allegra, who tends to meet her lovers while engaging in death-defying activities, feels betrayed when she discovers her current partner, aspiring writer Corinne, has used Allegra's life as the basis for her short stories. Grigg is attracted to Jocelyn and mystified by her seeming lack of interest in him, marked by her failure to read the Ursula K. Le Guin novels he has hoped will catch her fancy. He also serves as the comedic foil to Jocelyn and Prudie's very serious takes on the books.

1937542Living In Oblivion is divided into three parts, all of which concern the making of a low-budget movie featuring the same director, crew and substantially the same cast. Part one: Director Nick Reve  is shooting a low-budget independent film in the middle of New York City. The catering crew are under-funded and apathetic, deciding not to replace a carton of milk that has been on the craft service table for a week. The scene being shot is a difficult one: a young woman, Ellen, reproaches her elderly mother  for not intervening when the father beat Ellen as a child. However, on the set, just about everything that can go wrong does go wrong: shots are spoiled because of the mic boom is visible; the camera assistant fails to keep the shot in focus; Cora, the actress playing the mother, forgets her lines; and Nicole, the actress playing Ellen, becomes increasingly unfocused and careless. A dispirited Nick calls for a rehearsal without camera to refresh the actors. However, when Nicole  berates herself for acting badly, Cora  reassures her with a gesture that reminds Nicole of a similar gesture made by her own terminally ill mother. Nicole is so upset by the memory that she turns in an unexpectedly passionate performance; and Cora, startled by Nicole's sudden intensity, is equally good. Watching them, Nick becomes enthusiastic all over again. Unfortunately, it was not captured on film; cinematographer and camera operator Wolf , who has been diluting the sub-standard coffee with the spoiled milk, was vomiting in the toilet throughout. Nick ruefully calls for another take. This time, a sudden and insistent beeping sound distracts the actors. Nobody can tell where it's coming from; and Nick flies into a rage, berating everyone on the crew and cast for their inadequacies. He then wakes up in his own bed; the beeping sound was his own alarm clock. He has dreamed the entire segment. It is 4.30am; and he is due on set. Part two: Early the same morning, the film's lead actor Chad Palomino  is getting dressed in Nicole's hotel room. They have spent the night together, and Chad suggests that they might get together again later; Nicole politely declines. Chad and Nicole arrive on the set separately. Nicole's character Ellen and Chad's character Damian have been in love for years but have never admitted it until the scene being shot on this day. Shooting the scene is made practically impossible by Chad's irregular acting. He keeps changing his mind about where to stand and continually moves to places where he is either invisible or badly lit by scenic light. Nicole becomes increasingly frustrated by Chad's egomania; and, when he starts to stroke her head, she briefly loses her cool, then apologizes. An irritated Chad demands a private talk with Nick. He tells Nick that he has slept with Nicole and makes out that it was she, not he, who had wanted to continue the relationship. Desperate to keep Chad happy, Nick agrees that Nicole is not very good. Nicole overhears this conversation on the sound mixer's headphones. Pretending to be contrite, she asks Nick if they can improvise a little; but, when they do so, she announces to everyone that, although she slept with Chad, she is not at all interested in him. Chad loses his temper and quits the movie. Relieved that he will no longer have to please Chad, Nick calls him a ""Hostess Twinkie motherfucker"" and a fight breaks out. Nick beats Chad senseless and fires him. He apologises to Nicole and confesses that he loves her. They kiss—then Nicole abruptly wakes up, still in her bed, having dreamed the whole thing. Part three: Later the same day, the crew is setting up for a dream sequence in which Nicole, as Ellen, stands still while a dwarf walks around her holding an apple. Nick claims to have learned a lesson from his own dream: That sometimes, ""you just got to roll with things."" Nicole admits that she had a dream with Nick in it but doesn't tell him what happened. Nick manages to keep up his positive attitude despite the various mishaps that occur: The smoke machine fails to work, then it catches fire, then his senile mother Cora arrives on the set. However, the ill-tempered dwarf actor Tito  complains that the dream sequence is a cliché  and walks off the set in disgust. Nick's confidence collapses, and he announces that the movie is over. At that moment, his mother intervenes, grabbing the apple, moving to Tito's mark and announcing that she is ""ready"". The crew scrambles to shoot the scene, and her manic performance injects fresh energy and conviction into it. Nick is delighted and decides to keep the new dream sequence, and there is a tense moment while the sound mixer records 30 seconds of room tone. The entire cast and crew manages to remain silent, and they go on to shooting the next sequence.
31555231In flashback, Niall , a local news reporter, recalls visiting his mother's grave, as he smartens up in a toilet mirror. His colleague Tammy  knocks on the toilet door to hurry him up and as they walk to the car she instructs him on the art of the 'death-knock': knocking on the doors of the recently bereaved to obtain quotes and pictures of the deceased for the newspaper. Niall's poor track record has put his job on the line and Tammy has been detailed to improve his hit-rate. When they reach the house of Mrs Wright, who has lost her son in a car accident, Niall goes in first while Tammy waits outside. Before Niall can introduce himself and launch into his spiel that Tammy has prepared for him, Mrs Wright  interrupts him - ""I know who you are"" - and ushers him into the house. There she ropes him into unstacking the dishwasher as Niall tries in vain to broach the subject of the bereavement against the sound of a fire alarm which has been set off by the cigarette Mrs Wright is smoking. Mrs Wright appears baffled by Niall's requests for pictures and instead offers him some soup telling him they will look at some pictures ""in the morning"", much to Niall's surprise. She then leads him upstairs to the bedroom and encourages him to get some rest. Trapped in the bedroom, Niall examines the dead boy's belongings and finds himself playing with his toys. Meanwhile, Tammy waits outside taking a phone call from her boss at the newspaper, to whom she explains that Niall ""is still in there, so he must be doing alright"". Whilst playing with a light sabre, Niall knocks off a shelf-load of items and as he picks them up, he finds a photo of the dead boy. Mrs Wright, alerted by the noise, appears behind him and embracing Niall, she tells him: ""it's been a long day: time for bed."" Tammy knocks at the door and attempts to talk to Mrs Wright about the accident in which her son was killed, but Mrs Wright replies that her son is in his room and that there must be some mistake. Closing the door, she is nonetheless shaken by Tammy's insistence that her son is dead and she climbs the stairs to the bedroom where she finds Niall tucked up fast asleep in her son's bed. She kisses him on the cheek and switches out the light.
384141The story revolves around a farmer Shambu Mahato , who lives with his wife Parvati `Paro’  and son Kanhaiya  in a small village that has been hit badly by a famine. After years of drought, the region finally gets rain, leading to the farmers to rejoice. Shambu owns two bighas  of land, which is the only means of livelihood for the whole family. The local zamindar  Thakur Harnam Singh ([[Murad  partners with some city business men to construct a mill on his large parcel of land, which in return would profit them and bring prosperity to the village. The only problem is that in the middle of Harnam singh's land lay Shambu's meager two bighas of land. Harnam Singh is very confident that he could buy Shambu's land. Shambu has borrowed money from Harnam Singh several times in the past and has not paid back his debt. Harnam Singh calls for Shambu and proposes Shambu to sell his land to him in exchange for his debt. Shambu disagrees to sell his only livelihood and Harnam Singh gets upset. Harnam Singh orders him to pay back his debt by the next day or risk auctioning his land. Shambu comes back home to discuss the issue with his father, and with the help of his son, they figure out that the debt amounts to 65 rupees. Shambu wants to save his land by all means and sells all his household items including his wife's gold earrings. When Shambu meets Harman Singh's accountant to pay back his debt of 65 rupees, he's shocked to know that he actually owes 235 rupees. The accountant had forged the accounts and now refuses to consider the labor provided by Shambu's father Gangu as portion of debt payoff. The case goes to court and Shambu being an illiterate, has a tough time explaining to the judge how the accountant forged the numbers and how he took accountant's word of mouth and did not demand any receipt. Shambu loses the case, however the judge orders Shambu to pay back 235 rupees to Harnam Singh in three months. If Shambu is not able to pay back his debt, then his land would be auctioned off and the proceeds would go to pay off his debts. Shambu now struggles to get the money and he is unable to get a loan because he has no collaterals. One of his village friends gives him an idea to go to Calcutta  and try to get a job to earn enough money to pay off his debt. Shambu likes this idea, but faces resistance from his wife as she's pregnant and does not want to live away from him. Shambu persuades her that he'll be gone for three months only and it would benefit his family and the new born baby. Kanhaiya wants to join his father too, but Shambu refuses and scolds him. On the train to Calcutta, Shambu finds Kanhaiya hiding and hitchhiking with him and after a brief confrontation agrees to take Kanhaiya with him. In Calcutta, Shambu and Kanhaiya face a harsh welcome. Nobody is willing to talk with them, let alone help them. Kanhaiya befriends a street side shoe shiner named Lalu `Ustad’ . They hope for no prospective and even loose their last possessions while they are asleep on the street sides.

Back in the village, Parvati and Gangu survive on eating water chestnuts picked up from the local river. She's seeks help from Bahu  to write letters to Shambu and stay in touch. As the three months end date nears by, Shambu becomes aggressive about earning and saving more money. One day, a man asks Shambu to chase another rickshaw that is carrying his girlfriend. Shambu is insisted to pull the rickshaw very fast for more money. The rickshaw loses a wheel and Shambu meets with an accident. Looking at the condition of his father, Kanhaiya joins a pick pocketer in order to earn quick money. Shambu gets mad and beats Kanhaiya when he comes to know about his dirty earnings. Meanwhile, Parvati gets worried since she receives no letters or money from Shambu and the Zamindar's accountant accuses Shambu that he has forgotten his family. She ends up working on a local construction site and gets devastated when she receives the news that Shambu has met with an accident. Finally, Parvati decides to visit Shambu in the city even though Gangu is on bed rest suffering of high fever. Parvati arrives in Calcutta, and is taken by a strange man, who claims he knows Shambu and will take her to him. He takes her to his shed and tries to steal and force her. She flees from him, but comes under a car. The crowd gathers around her and they call for a rickshaw to take her to the hospital. Shambu who was passing by offers a ride, and is shocked to see his injured wife. Meanwhile, Kanhaiya not able to withstand his father's condition steals money from a lady and runs back to the slum.

He then tries to get a handful of dirt from his land, but is stopped and forced to throw away by a security guard. The film ends as Shambu and his family walks away from their land.
20841547Somewhere in Beverly Hills, in the house of Jack Benny , a mouse version of Jack is practicing his violin---off key---and saying to himself, ""Who is this guy Isaac Stern?""  Outside Jack's mouse hole, a cat is lying in wait, wearing ear muffs to filter out the discordant sound of Jack's violin. Jack calls his servant, Rochester  to get his white suit, which Rochester is wearing at the time. Jack tells the valet that his rental period is up  and he needs the suit because he is taking Mary Livingstone out for her birthday, and, true to character, is looking for a good cheap restaurant. While waiting for Mary, Jack decides to count his cheese in a basement vault. Using a coin on a string, he opens the lock, which appears to be a coin-operated lock from a pay toilet. As soon as he walks through the door, he takes a cane from a nail on the wall and starts humming We're in the Money. When he reaches the bottom of the stairs, he reaches through a hole and trips a razor blade hanging above the passageway like a guillotine. He then comes up to a derringer and uses the cane to trip the trigger on the derringer. Finally, he comes up to another hole, reaches through with the cane and trips a mousetrap. He then reaches the vault door, opens a combination lock, pulls the door open and numerous sound effects including various alarms, a foghorn and machine gun noises are heard. Ed, the vault guard, asks ""who goes there?"", and then an exchange is heard where Ed, apparently having been in the vault for a long time, asks ""did we win the war yet?"" When Benny assures Ed that the war had been won, thinking that Ed was referring to World War II, Ed says: ""That's good. What do you think we'll do with the Kaiser?"" Mary arrives while Jack is inspecting his cheese vault, and he emerges wondering who has been pilfering his gorgonzola. A fat rodent version of Don Wilson attempts to deliver a commercial when Jack advises him that this is a movie and not a television program. When Mary suggests a place, Jack's eyes ring up like an old cash register with a dollar sign  and ""no sale"", they discuss other options. As they were discussing the options, the cat writes a message extolling the ""Kit Kat Club""  and sends it to Jack as a paper airplane. Jack and Mary putter off in his Maxwell with Rochester behind the wheel until they reach the Kit Kat Club by following the arrows pointing to it. While enroute, Mary asks for champagne, while Jack says that he prefers a good ""mousecatel"". Unbeknownst to them, the ""club"" is actually the maw of a real cat, and as they enter, the cat's mouth closes on them. Jack cries: ""Help! Help!"" as the camera cuts to the live-action Jack Benny, who wakes up and, breaking the fourth wall, tells the audience: ""Gosh, what a crazy dream! Imagine- Mary and me as two little mice trapped inside a cat's mouth! And me playing the violin!"" At that point, Jack is interrupted by the sound of a discordant ""Rock-a-Bye Baby"" played on the violin, coming from within Jack's live-action cat. From there, the rodent versions of Jack and Mary emerge unharmed from the live-action cat. Following one last bit of animation , the real Jack Benny does one of his famous ""takes"" as the cartoon fades out.
1730420While driving cross-country from Boston to San Diego in their new Jeep Grand Cherokee, Jeff Taylor and his wife Amy narrowly miss colliding with a beat-up Ford F-150 that darts in front of them from an connecting road on a deserted highway. Later, while stopped at a gas station, the truck's driver, Earl, exchanges hostile words with Jeff before the couple resume their journey. Shortly afterwards, their Jeep breaks down in the middle of the desert. Leaving Jeff with the car, Amy accepts a ride from a passing big-rig trucker named Red Barr driving a Peterbilt 385, to get to a nearby diner and call for help. Jeff eventually discovers that the Jeep's battery connections have been suspiciously tampered with, and, after reconnecting them, drives to the diner, only to find that no one has seen his wife. When he catches up with Barr on the road and forces him to stop, the trucker claims he has never seen Jeff or his wife before. Jeff hails a passing sheriff, named Boyd, but a brief search of Barr's truck yields no sign of Amy, and he is let go. Jeff then goes to a police station where he is advised by a deputy to go back to the diner and wait for his wife. There Jeff meets with a simpleton mechanic named Billy, who says he saw Amy arrive in one truck and leave in another. He tells Jeff where they have taken her, but refuses to speak with the police, thinking that they are involved. Jeff heads to the location Billy mentioned, but is ambushed on a back road by Earl, and escapes by driving his Jeep into a river. Abandoning the Jeep and later circling back to watch his attackers salvage the Jeep from the water, Jeff is discovered and knocked out by Billy, an accomplice who had feigned mental impairment earlier. Jeff awakens in a car trunk surrounded by Earl, Billy, another accomplice, Al, a tow-truck driver, and their leader, Red Barr. Red tells Jeff that his wife will be released in exchange for $90,000 that the kidnappers think Jeff has in his bank account. Knowing that he only has a small fraction of the assumed amount, Jeff enters a nearby bank to withdraw what little money he has. After a failed attempt to alert the bank manager to his danger, Jeff steals marked money ribbons and a letter opener from the manager's desk; Jeff uses money ribbons to packet $1 bills in-between two $100 bills, fooling the kidnappers. With the ransom now in hand, Jeff is then instructed by phone to leave town, where he is picked up and bound with duct tape by Earl in his pickup truck. While gloating about how easy Jeff and his wife were to abduct by rigging their car to break down after leaving the gas station, as well as bragging that he intends to kill Jeff and his wife anyway, Earl discovers Jeff's ruse with the ransom. At exactly the same moment, Jeff frees himself and stabs Earl in the chest with the letter opener. After a struggle in the speeding, swerving pickup, Jeff takes over the vehicle, bounds Earl, and forces him to reveal his rendezvous with Red at a local truck stop. Sheriff Boyd appears in his patrol car and, seeing the swerving pickup, calls for backup and stops the vehicle. After Jeff exits the truck with Earl's pistol in hand, a stressed Boyd mistakes the situation and forces Jeff at gunpoint down onto the road. Earl frees himself and shoots Boyd with another pistol concealed in his boot. Just as Earl is about to shoot Jeff, a wounded Boyd shoots and kills Earl. Jeff uses Boyd's radio to call for an ambulance and heads to the truck stop Earl mentioned. At the rest stop, Jeff avoids the police looking for him in connection to the shooting of Boyd, and then spots Red talking on a payphone with another accomplice. Jeff follows Red to his truck where he jumps under the moving truck as Red drives away. Jeff loses his pistol while climbing aboard, but stows away to Red's farm at which he arrives early the next morning. Hiding in a barn, Jeff watches as Red and his remaining accomplices take a bound and gagged Amy and lock her in a freezer in the barn's cellar, leaving her to die. Unable to open the locked cellar door, Jeff finds a gun in Red's truck and uses it to hold Red, his accomplices, and his wife and son at gunpoint, demands the cellar key. Billy escapes, but Jeff forces the rest of the group to safely release Amy from the freezer before locking them in the cellar. Jeff and Amy then flee in a stolen Chevrolet C-20 pickup, while Billy frees Red and Al. They pursue the Taylors in their respective vehicles. During the climactic chase, Billy is killed in a fiery crash when Jeff forces his car off the road, while the trailer from Red's truck detaches, causing Al to violently crash into it. Undeterred, Red attempts to ram Jeff's vehicle off a bridge, trapping Amy's leg underneath the dashboard. Red's big rig nearly falls off the edge and becomes suspended by a steel bridge support. Jeff battles Red on the suspended big rig, eventually hurling Red to the rocks below. Jeff frees Amy from the dashboard in which she  pulls the automatic shift on their pickup, causing the semi to fall on Red and crush him. Sitting on the edge of the bridge beside their mangled pickup truck, Jeff and Amy embrace each other.

384990Ann  lives in Baton Rouge. She is unhappily married to John  and has never experienced an orgasm. She is seeing a counselor for her problems. Graham Dalton  is an old college friend of John's. He is now a seeming drifter who, after nine years, returns to live in Baton Rouge. Graham arrives to find Ann, who has no idea that John has invited Graham to stay with them until he finds an apartment. When John arrives home, Graham's demeanor becomes remarkably more guarded, due in large part to John's overt disapproval of Graham's bohemian persona. They also discuss the fact that Graham's college girlfriend, Elizabeth, is also living in Baton Rouge. John is sleeping with Ann's sister, Cynthia , a free-spirited bartender. He rationalizes it by blaming Ann's frigidity. He frequently leaves his law office mid-day to meet with Cynthia, instructing his secretary to reschedule clients who are already in the lobby waiting to see him. Ann makes an impromptu visit to Graham's apartment, where she notices stacks of camcorder tapes around the television. When pressed, Graham explains that he interviews women about their sexual experiences and fantasies, on videotape. Ann, overcome with shock and confusion, flees his apartment. Within a day, Cynthia appears at Graham's apartment and introduces herself. Cynthia presses Graham to explain what ""spooked"" Ann the preceding day. Graham explains the videotapes, and admits to Cynthia his sexual dysfunction: that he is impotent when in the presence of another person, and that he achieves gratification by watching these videos in private. Graham propositions Cynthia to make a tape, assuring her that no other person is allowed to see the tapes. She believes him, and agrees. Cynthia reports back to Ann, who is horrified. Cynthia also tells John. When Ann discovers Cynthia's pearl earring in her bedroom, she is furious. She heads over to Graham's apartment with the intention of making a videotape. Graham objects, telling her it is something she would not do in a normal frame of mind. She insists and Graham relents. Afterward, Ann demands a divorce from John. In the ensuing argument, John gleans that Ann has been to Graham's, and that she made a video. He hits Graham and locks him out of the house, then watches Ann's tape. In it, Ann says she has never felt any kind of 'satisfaction' from sex. After Graham asks if she ever thinks of having sex with other men, she admits she has thought of Graham. Ann later turns the camera on Graham. Graham confesses that he is haunted by Elizabeth, and that his motivation in returning to Baton Rouge is a vague notion of reconnecting with her. He explains that he was a pathological liar, which destroyed an otherwise rewarding relationship with Elizabeth. He explains that he has since gone to great lengths to keep people at a distance and avoid relationships. Graham turns off the camera; it is implied that the two have sex. A chastened John joins Graham on the front patio and, with obvious pleasure, confesses to having sex with Elizabeth while she and Graham were a couple. Furious, Graham goes into a rage and destroys all of the tapes, as well as his camera. In the end, John is summoned to his boss's office, where it’s implied that he is about to be fired due to his frequent cancellations of meetings with important clients to have sexual trysts with Cynthia. In the next scene, Ann and Cynthia reconcile at the bar Cynthia tends before Ann returns home and joins Graham on the front porch, as they appear to be a couple.

He feels that he is not in a position to drink anymore with safety. He tells the group that he copes by praying and states that he is grateful to be at the meeting. He receives a round of applause for his admissions. He goes round to his friend's place, bangs on the door and pretends to be the police. His friends soon realise that they have been tricked. They then travel in Joe's van where they examine stolen sporting merchandise which is of low quality. Joe and his friends stop at another person's house in order to pick up more people. A car cuts off the van. Joe later encounters the driver, whom Joe later describes as being 'the woman who tried to kill us all.' He exits his van and asks the woman if she lost her guide dog. The woman, Sarah, states that she is a health visitor. She wants to see Liam and his child, but Joe explains that Liam has an important football game to attend. The next shot is of the football match. Joe is very encouraging as a coach. The other team appears in white and black, which are the colours that Joe's team wears. Joe's team express their anger at this and respond by taking their shirts off so that they are able to distinguish between players. The other team scores the first goal of the game. Joe drives Liam home and tells Liam to take things one day at a time. Liam abruptly tells Joe to pull over and Liam runs up to a male who acts aggressively towards him. Joe does not hear what transpires between Liam and the man. Later, Joe sees Sarah, who is seen struggling with wallpaper in her car. Joe appears to fancy her, as Sarah tells him her name and he flirts with her. Joe then helps an acquaintance of Sarah's to complete a wall papering and paint job in Sarah's flat. Sarah then leaves the lads to it. She later brings them tea as they paint the ceiling and sing to themselves. They then look outside and notice someone taking photos of them through the window.

They are able to make comfortable conversation with one another. There is a bottle of red wine on the table, but Joe does not drink any of the alcohol. Sarah's telephone rings and she leaves the kitchen to answer it. Joe is then left alone with the wine. He clears his plate and appears somewhat nervous. When Sarah finishes with her telephone conversation, Joe asks her about the photographs on her wall. Joe later reveals to Sarah that he does not drink, to which Sarah replies: 'Why didn't you say?' Joe reveals that he is an alcoholic and he has not had a drink in ten months. Joe is happy that Sarah knows and that she has been direct in her responses to him. Joe thanks Sarah for her company. Sarah pays Joe for the work that he completed on her flat and they part company. Joe attends the Mayfield Health Centre. The practice is very busy and the receptionist tries to cope with a patient who is complaining because he has been waiting a long time in order to receive his prescription. Joe tells the receptionist that he would like to see Sarah. The receptionist does not appear to be surprised by his request and says that Joe is free to pop his head around the door. He sees Sarah advising parents on dealing with the changing of nappies. Outside the Health Centre, Joe asks Sarah if she would like to go ten-pin bowling with him and to ring him if she fancies going. They then part company. Sarah speaks with a female colleague, Maggie, and says that Joe seems a bit wild. She states that she is not going to go bowling with Joe. The next shot is of a bowling alley, with 'Spirit in the Sky' playing in the background. Sarah and Joe bowl together and laugh at their many errors. They occupy Aisle 16 and neither of them are spectacular players. They go back to Sarah's place where she asks him in for a cup of tea. Joe politely says no. Sarah offers him money for a taxi. A friendly argument ensues, at the end of which Sarah finds herself locked out of her flat. Sarah says that she can sleep in her car. Joe states that Sarah can sleep at his place, but not necessarily together. They arrive at Joe's and he shows her around his flat. While Joe makes tea for Sarah, she asks him if it is alright to put some music on. She puts on the same piece of music that the audience heard during the opening credits of the film, Beethoven's Violin Concerto in D Major. Joe tells Sarah that he used to be in a band and they won a local talent contest. Joe tells Sarah a story of how he was desperate for a drink one day and what transpired. He went to a music shop and stole some cassettes. He took one of them home and 'got pissed.' He describes the experience as being 'magical.' When Sarah asks him what made him stop drinking, Joe asks her why she wants to know. He is not hostile, but curious. Joe says that he is scared to tell her and that there is a strong chance that she will hate him if he tells. Joe explains that there was a girl he used to drink with and they loved one another. They were both 'just tangled up' and they used to get into terrible arguments and tear one another apart. The audience then sees a flashback where Joe and the girl are returning home from a night out. He states that 'a cloud just descended... really, really dark. And suddenly I hated her. I hated me.' He describes how he tried to open the door, but was unable to; when the partner whom he was with laughed at him, Joe lost control because she found it funny. He beat her by punching and kicking her, while she lay helpless on the ground. He screamed abuse at her. The next day, he had a blackout. Now, he remembers every punch and kick. He states how ashamed and disgusted he is with himself. He is obviously contrite and he has not yet forgiven himself for his actions. In the next shot, Sarah comforts Joe and tells him that it is okay. The next scene is of a football match. Joe sees three men beating up Liam. Joe attempts to intervene. He helps Liam up and asks him if he is still clean. Liam states that he is. Liam confronts his wife when she comes home. He suspects that she has been using and asks her if she 'takes him for a prick.' Liam then yells that he will leave her to rot, grabs her by her neck and forces her to look at herself in the mirror. Joe then attends Liam's flat and encounters Liam's wife shooting up in the bathroom. An argument erupts between them. Joe offers to help her. She does not want the kind of help that Joe offers. Joe then reluctantly assists her to tie off one of her veins so that she can shoot up. Joe tries to make sense of her incoherent mumbles as she lies prostrate in the bathtub. Joe then goes to a snooker club where he asks after Liam's whereabouts. Joe tells one of the men that he encounters that Liam has a four-year-old boy in an attempt to mitigate matters. Liam says that he does not want them to take liberties. He comes across Liam and is cross because Liam told him that he had stopped dealing. A tearful Liam confesses that he still owes money. Joe also tells Liam that he suspects that his wife is on the game. He is worried that people are going to break his legs. Joe and Sarah prepare a meal together, which is interrupted when they have sex. The next day, Joe goes to Stella Maris' B & B in order to deal with the matter of Liam. In a later scene, Joe gives Sarah a pair of earrings, as well as a ring. Joe tells Sarah that he loves her. Sarah tells him that she does not want it and Joe cannot understand what he has done wrong. Joe is confused as to why Sarah has behaved in this fashion. In the next shot, we see a copy of the Alcoholics Anonymous' small blue Bible as Joe listens to Beethoven's Violin Concerto in D Major and makes notes in a book. When Sarah arrives at his door, she apologises. They drink tea together and later embrace. Joe drives his van and his mates direct him to a place where they rob another van. At the outset, Joe does not know where they are going. Joe is shocked with his unwitting role in the robbery of Astral Sports. He still acts as the get-away driver. At the next football match, Joe cleverly remarks that the other team look like budgies because of their blue and yellow striped uniforms. Meanwhile, Sarah reveals to her co-worker Maggie that she is pregnant. Maggie congratulates her. At Sarah's flat, she expresses her reservations about Joe's dealings with Liam. Joe tells her that there are some things that she does not need to know. Joe outlines the limited choices that Liam faces, most of which are not pleasant. Sarah accuses Joe of being a drug dealer and asks where he got the money for her earrings and ring. Joe replies that the gang gave him some money. Sarah becomes enraged and asks, 'Are you going to hit me too, Joe?' Joe attends Liam's flat and states that Liam must deal with things himself. Joe returns to his flat with bottles of Smirnoff Vodka. He pours himself a drink, and takes a sip. Liam then goes to Joe's flat, where Joe is very inebriated. Joe does not understand why Liam has come to see him. Joe calls Liam a 'stupid wee prick.' The alcohol has overtaken Joe and he is hostile to Liam, who needs his help. As Liam witnesses members of the gang coming towards the premises, Liam realises that Joe has passed out and he kisses Joe on his forehead. Joe suddenly snaps awake and realises that Liam has taken his own life by hanging himself. The film concludes with Liam's funeral.
6189444Unlucky plumber – Athanasius Borshchov   and his friend Fedulov  spend all day and night avoiding work and finding opportunities to drink. Afonya takes ""kickbacks"" from clients and is often in trouble with the local committee for his behaviour. Afonya meets plasterer Kolya  in a pub, gets drunk and comes home. When his girlfriend sees the state he's in, she leaves him. The next morning he can't even remember yesterday's drinking companion. Things continue to go downhill for Afonya. When student interns from the vocational school are allocated to the plumbers, master ZHEK Vostryakovo  doesn't allocate any to him, fearing that he will not teach them well. Afonya begs for trainees and gets two. Having worked with him for one day and having seen his attitude and working methods, the trainees refuse to work with him anymore. The next day, Kolya arrives to live at Afonya's, having been thrown out of his house by his wife. At a dance Afonya meets young nurse Katya Snegireva , who knows about him through her brother, who used to play in Afonya's volleyball team. Afonya doesn't pay her much attention, because he's more interested in older women and already has his eye on one at the dance. However, a romantic walk with the older woman after the dance is over before it begins – Afonya is challenged to a fight by a hooligan, who he'd quarrelled with at the dance. The hooligan's friends join in, and finish the unequal fight. Katya worries for Afonya's safety, and calls the militia - which will only bring Anfonya to the committee's attention again. At a regular work call Borshchov meets Helen  and falls in love at first sight. He starts finding any excuse to work in her flat - even fooling a tenant, astronomer , by swapping his new Finnish sink for an old one, so he can install the Finnish sink in Helen's home as a gift. In his dreams Athos sees a family idyll with his wife Helen and their perfect children. Katya Snegireva, head over heels for Afonya, keeps engineering new meetings with him, and stops at nothing to attract his attention: ""Athanasius! someone called, I thought it was – you ... "". Afonya is completely oblivious to her feelings. Meanwhile Afonya's run in with the militia catches up with him and, for persistent drunkenness, truancy and fighting Afonya is threatened with being sacked at a meeting of the local committee. In addition, if he doesn't restore the Finnish sink he's definitely going to be fired. Afonya takes a porcelain sink with flowers to Helen to swap with the Finnish sink, but meets Helen coming home with company. She makes her feelings quite clear: she has her own life among fashionable and wealthy men, and Afonya is just a plumber. Afonya, depressed, goes to a restaurant with Fedulov and tries to escape into drunkenness, but it doesn't help. In his drunken state he goes to Katya Snegireva's home and proposes marriage, and wakes up next to her in the morning. Katya tells him she's due to move to Africa with work and wonders if she should cancel for Afonya. Afonya then decides to go back to his village, to his aunt Frosya , who brought him up. In the village, he meets his childhood friend Concertina  and, in a joyous moment sends the city a telegram resigning from his job and giving up his apartment. Only then does he learn that Aunt Frosya died two years ago. Afonya's depression increases – he has lost everything and has nowhere to go. Neighbour Uncle Yegor  gives Athos his Aunt Frosya's legacy – savings account in his name, the deeds to her house, and the letters she'd sent to herself, pretending they were from Afonya to the neighbours . The guilt of having ignored her only increases his gloom. Athanasius goes to the post office and tries to call Katya Snegireva on her memorable phone number 50-50-2, or as he says himself, ""rug-rug or two."" The answer comes back - Katya has left. Finally frustrated, he goes to the airport. He does not care where he's going or what will happen to him. Things have gotten so bad that a local militia man has to be convinced Afonya is the man in his passport photograph, so grim has he gotten since it was taken. Finally, just when Athanasius is heading to the AN-2 aircraft , a familiar girlish voice calls out. It's Katya, suitcase in hand: ""Athanasius!, someone called, I thought it was – you ... "

1273501Early in the Second World War, a raiding party of six Nazi sailors, caught ashore when their U-boat is sunk in Hudson Bay, attempt to evade capture by travelling across Canada to the still-neutral United States. The film's title comes from the 49th parallel north which marks part of the border between the two countries. Led by Lieutenants Hirth  and Kuhnecke , the small band of sailors encounter and sometimes brutalize a wide range of people, including the Eskimo Nick , the French-Canadian trapper , the floatplane crew and local Eskimo onlookers, pacifistic German Hutterite farmers, an innocent motorist, and the eccentric English academic and author ([[Leslie Howard . Making their way across Canada first using a stolen seaplane, the five surviving members of the Nazi band try to stir up sympathy among the Hutterite community outside Winnipeg, believing them to be countrymen. Lieutenant Hirth's stirring speech is rejected by Peter , the community's leader, and even by one of their own, Vogel , who comes to the aid of Anna . Vogel is tried by Lieutenant Hirth and summarily executed for the greater crime of trying to break away from the Nazi group. Hijacking an innocent motorist for his automobile, Hirth, Lohrmann and Kranz flee West. With all of Canada searching for them, and having killed 11 civilians along the way, Lohrmann is arrested by Canadian Mounties at a public gathering. Next, Kranz  is knocked out cold by writer Phillip A-Scott  in a cave - despite having been wounded. Finally, the story comes to a head with a confrontation on a freight train between Hirth, the sole remaining fugitive at large, and AWOL Canadian soldier Andy Brock . When Hirth learns the train has crossed into the United States, he surrenders his gun to a customs official and demands to be taken to the German embassy in the U.S. . However, Brock points out that Hirth is locked in the freight hold, but is not listed on the freight manifest, and convinces both American customs officials instead, that the freight car together with Hirth and Brock be sent back to Canada as ""improperly manifested cargo"" - which they readily comply with. The film ends with the train reversing to Canada and Brock about to pummel Hirth in the boxcar.

13379536The book club is the brainchild of fiftysomething six-time divorcée Bernadette, who latches onto the idea when she meets Prudie, a prim, married high school French teacher in her mid-20s, at a Jane Austen film festival. Her concept is to have six members discuss all of Austen's six novels, with each member hosting the group once a month. Also inducted into the club are Sylvia, a fortysomething librarian who recently has separated from her philandering lawyer husband Daniel after more than two decades of marriage; Sylvia's 20-something lesbian daughter Allegra; Jocelyn, a happily unmarried control freak and breeder of Rhodesian Ridgebacks who has been Sylvia's friend since childhood; and Grigg, a science fiction fan who's roped into the group by Jocelyn with the hope he and Sylvia will prove to be a compatible match. As the months pass, each of the members develops characteristics similar to those of Austen's characters and reacts to events in their lives in much the same way their fictional counterparts would. Bernadette is the matriarch figure who longs to see everyone find happiness. Sylvia clings to her belief in steadfast love and devotion, and eventually reconciles with Daniel. Jocelyn denies her own feelings for Grigg while playing matchmaker for him and Sylvia. Prudie, encumbered with her inattentive husband Dean and a free-spirited, pot-smoking, aging-hippie mother, a product of the 1960s counterculture, finds herself desperately trying not to succumb to her feelings for her seductive student Trey. Allegra, who tends to meet her lovers while engaging in death-defying activities, feels betrayed when she discovers her current partner, aspiring writer Corinne, has used Allegra's life as the basis for her short stories. Grigg is attracted to Jocelyn and mystified by her seeming lack of interest in him, marked by her failure to read the Ursula K. Le Guin novels he has hoped will catch her fancy. He also serves as the comedic foil to Jocelyn and Prudie's very serious takes on the books.

1937542Living In Oblivion is divided into three parts, all of which concern the making of a low-budget movie featuring the same director, crew and substantially the same cast. Part one: Director Nick Reve  is shooting a low-budget independent film in the middle of New York City. The catering crew are under-funded and apathetic, deciding not to replace a carton of milk that has been on the craft service table for a week. The scene being shot is a difficult one: a young woman, Ellen, reproaches her elderly mother  for not intervening when the father beat Ellen as a child. However, on the set, just about everything that can go wrong does go wrong: shots are spoiled because of the mic boom is visible; the camera assistant fails to keep the shot in focus; Cora, the actress playing the mother, forgets her lines; and Nicole, the actress playing Ellen, becomes increasingly unfocused and careless. A dispirited Nick calls for a rehearsal without camera to refresh the actors. However, when Nicole  berates herself for acting badly, Cora  reassures her with a gesture that reminds Nicole of a similar gesture made by her own terminally ill mother. Nicole is so upset by the memory that she turns in an unexpectedly passionate performance; and Cora, startled by Nicole's sudden intensity, is equally good. Watching them, Nick becomes enthusiastic all over again. Unfortunately, it was not captured on film; cinematographer and camera operator Wolf , who has been diluting the sub-standard coffee with the spoiled milk, was vomiting in the toilet throughout. Nick ruefully calls for another take. This time, a sudden and insistent beeping sound distracts the actors. Nobody can tell where it's coming from; and Nick flies into a rage, berating everyone on the crew and cast for their inadequacies. He then wakes up in his own bed; the beeping sound was his own alarm clock. He has dreamed the entire segment. It is 4.30am; and he is due on set. Part two: Early the same morning, the film's lead actor Chad Palomino  is getting dressed in Nicole's hotel room. They have spent the night together, and Chad suggests that they might get together again later; Nicole politely declines. Chad and Nicole arrive on the set separately. Nicole's character Ellen and Chad's character Damian have been in love for years but have never admitted it until the scene being shot on this day. Shooting the scene is made practically impossible by Chad's irregular acting. He keeps changing his mind about where to stand and continually moves to places where he is either invisible or badly lit by scenic light. Nicole becomes increasingly frustrated by Chad's egomania; and, when he starts to stroke her head, she briefly loses her cool, then apologizes. An irritated Chad demands a private talk with Nick. He tells Nick that he has slept with Nicole and makes out that it was she, not he, who had wanted to continue the relationship. Desperate to keep Chad happy, Nick agrees that Nicole is not very good. Nicole overhears this conversation on the sound mixer's headphones. Pretending to be contrite, she asks Nick if they can improvise a little; but, when they do so, she announces to everyone that, although she slept with Chad, she is not at all interested in him. Chad loses his temper and quits the movie. Relieved that he will no longer have to please Chad, Nick calls him a ""Hostess Twinkie motherfucker"" and a fight breaks out. Nick beats Chad senseless and fires him. He apologises to Nicole and confesses that he loves her. They kiss—then Nicole abruptly wakes up, still in her bed, having dreamed the whole thing. Part three: Later the same day, the crew is setting up for a dream sequence in which Nicole, as Ellen, stands still while a dwarf walks around her holding an apple. Nick claims to have learned a lesson from his own dream: That sometimes, ""you just got to roll with things."" Nicole admits that she had a dream with Nick in it but doesn't tell him what happened. Nick manages to keep up his positive attitude despite the various mishaps that occur: The smoke machine fails to work, then it catches fire, then his senile mother Cora arrives on the set. However, the ill-tempered dwarf actor Tito  complains that the dream sequence is a cliché  and walks off the set in disgust. Nick's confidence collapses, and he announces that the movie is over. At that moment, his mother intervenes, grabbing the apple, moving to Tito's mark and announcing that she is ""ready"". The crew scrambles to shoot the scene, and her manic performance injects fresh energy and conviction into it. Nick is delighted and decides to keep the new dream sequence, and there is a tense moment while the sound mixer records 30 seconds of room tone. The entire cast and crew manages to remain silent, and they go on to shooting the next sequence.
31555231In flashback, Niall , a local news reporter, recalls visiting his mother's grave, as he smartens up in a toilet mirror. His colleague Tammy  knocks on the toilet door to hurry him up and as they walk to the car she instructs him on the art of the 'death-knock': knocking on the doors of the recently bereaved to obtain quotes and pictures of the deceased for the newspaper. Niall's poor track record has put his job on the line and Tammy has been detailed to improve his hit-rate. When they reach the house of Mrs Wright, who has lost her son in a car accident, Niall goes in first while Tammy waits outside. Before Niall can introduce himself and launch into his spiel that Tammy has prepared for him, Mrs Wright  interrupts him - ""I know who you are"" - and ushers him into the house. There she ropes him into unstacking the dishwasher as Niall tries in vain to broach the subject of the bereavement against the sound of a fire alarm which has been set off by the cigarette Mrs Wright is smoking. Mrs Wright appears baffled by Niall's requests for pictures and instead offers him some soup telling him they will look at some pictures ""in the morning"", much to Niall's surprise. She then leads him upstairs to the bedroom and encourages him to get some rest. Trapped in the bedroom, Niall examines the dead boy's belongings and finds himself playing with his toys. Meanwhile, Tammy waits outside taking a phone call from her boss at the newspaper, to whom she explains that Niall ""is still in there, so he must be doing alright"". Whilst playing with a light sabre, Niall knocks off a shelf-load of items and as he picks them up, he finds a photo of the dead boy. Mrs Wright, alerted by the noise, appears behind him and embracing Niall, she tells him: ""it's been a long day: time for bed."" Tammy knocks at the door and attempts to talk to Mrs Wright about the accident in which her son was killed, but Mrs Wright replies that her son is in his room and that there must be some mistake.

384141The story revolves around a farmer Shambu Mahato , who lives with his wife Parvati `Paro’  and son Kanhaiya  in a small village that has been hit badly by a famine. After years of drought, the region finally gets rain, leading to the farmers to rejoice. Shambu owns two bighas  of land, which is the only means of livelihood for the whole family. The local zamindar  Thakur Harnam Singh ([[Murad  partners with some city business men to construct a mill on his large parcel of land, which in return would profit them and bring prosperity to the village. The only problem is that in the middle of Harnam singh's land lay Shambu's meager two bighas of land. Harnam Singh is very confident that he could buy Shambu's land. Shambu has borrowed money from Harnam Singh several times in the past and has not paid back his debt. Harnam Singh calls for Shambu and proposes Shambu to sell his land to him in exchange for his debt. Shambu disagrees to sell his only livelihood and Harnam Singh gets upset. Harnam Singh orders him to pay back his debt by the next day or risk auctioning his land. Shambu comes back home to discuss the issue with his father, and with the help of his son, they figure out that the debt amounts to 65 rupees. Shambu wants to save his land by all means and sells all his household items including his wife's gold earrings. When Shambu meets Harman Singh's accountant to pay back his debt of 65 rupees, he's shocked to know that he actually owes 235 rupees. The accountant had forged the accounts and now refuses to consider the labor provided by Shambu's father Gangu as portion of debt payoff. The case goes to court and Shambu being an illiterate, has a tough time explaining to the judge how the accountant forged the numbers and how he took accountant's word of mouth and did not demand any receipt. Shambu loses the case, however the judge orders Shambu to pay back 235 rupees to Harnam Singh in three months. If Shambu is not able to pay back his debt, then his land would be auctioned off and the proceeds would go to pay off his debts. Shambu now struggles to get the money and he is unable to get a loan because he has no collaterals. One of his village friends gives him an idea to go to Calcutta  and try to get a job to earn enough money to pay off his debt. Shambu likes this idea, but faces resistance from his wife as she's pregnant and does not want to live away from him. Shambu persuades her that he'll be gone for three months only and it would benefit his family and the new born baby. Kanhaiya wants to join his father too, but Shambu refuses and scolds him. On the train to Calcutta, Shambu finds Kanhaiya hiding and hitchhiking with him and after a brief confrontation agrees to take Kanhaiya with him. In Calcutta, Shambu and Kanhaiya face a harsh welcome. Nobody is willing to talk with them, let alone help them. Kanhaiya befriends a street side shoe shiner named Lalu `Ustad’ . They hope for no prospective and even loose their last possessions while they are asleep on the street sides. Kanhaiya falls ill, and Shambu ends up renting a small room in the slums with the help of a tea vendor and the landlady's adopted grandchild rani. In order to pay the rent, Shambu works a coolie. Shambu befriends an old rickshaw-puller , who helps him to get a license as a rickshaw-puller. Kanhaiya tries to help his family by taking up shoe shining with the help of old rickshaw-puller and Lalu `Ustad’. Back in the village, Parvati and Gangu survive on eating water chestnuts picked up from the local river. She's seeks help from Bahu  to write letters to Shambu and stay in touch. As the three months end date nears by, Shambu becomes aggressive about earning and saving more money. One day, a man asks Shambu to chase another rickshaw that is carrying his girlfriend. Shambu is insisted to pull the rickshaw very fast for more money. The rickshaw loses a wheel and Shambu meets with an accident. Looking at the condition of his father, Kanhaiya joins a pick pocketer in order to earn quick money. Shambu gets mad and beats Kanhaiya when he comes to know about his dirty earnings. Meanwhile, Parvati gets worried since she receives no letters or money from Shambu and the Zamindar's accountant accuses Shambu that he has forgotten his family. She ends up working on a local construction site and gets devastated when she receives the news that Shambu has met with an accident. Finally, Parvati decides to visit Shambu in the city even though Gangu is on bed rest suffering of high fever. Parvati arrives in Calcutta, and is taken by a strange man, who claims he knows Shambu and will take her to him. He takes her to his shed and tries to steal and force her. She flees from him, but comes under a car. The crowd gathers around her and they call for a rickshaw to take her to the hospital. Shambu who was passing by offers a ride, and is shocked to see his injured wife. Meanwhile, Kanhaiya not able to withstand his father's condition steals money from a lady and runs back to the slum. He comes to know about his mother's condition and rushes to the hospital. He cries after seeing his injured mother and claims that God has punished them because he started stealing money. He rips the money into pieces. The doctors tell Shambu that he has to spend money on medicine and blood in order to save his wife. Poor Shambu has no choice but so spend all his earnings to save his wife. Back in the village the land is auctioned because Shambu fails to pay back the debt and Gangu develops a mental disorder. The land is now owned by Harman Singh and the mill construction has begun. Shambu and his family come back to the village only to see their land sold and a factory being constructed over it. He then tries to get a handful of dirt from his land, but is stopped and forced to throw away by a security guard. The film ends as Shambu and his family walks away from their land.
20841547Somewhere in Beverly Hills, in the house of Jack Benny , a mouse version of Jack is practicing his violin---off key---and saying to himself, ""Who is this guy Isaac Stern?""  Outside Jack's mouse hole, a cat is lying in wait, wearing ear muffs to filter out the discordant sound of Jack's violin. Jack calls his servant, Rochester  to get his white suit, which Rochester is wearing at the time. Jack tells the valet that his rental period is up  and he needs the suit because he is taking Mary Livingstone out for her birthday, and, true to character, is looking for a good cheap restaurant. While waiting for Mary, Jack decides to count his cheese in a basement vault. Using a coin on a string, he opens the lock, which appears to be a coin-operated lock from a pay toilet. As soon as he walks through the door, he takes a cane from a nail on the wall and starts humming We're in the Money. When he reaches the bottom of the stairs, he reaches through a hole and trips a razor blade hanging above the passageway like a guillotine. He then comes up to a derringer and uses the cane to trip the trigger on the derringer. Finally, he comes up to another hole, reaches through with the cane and trips a mousetrap. He then reaches the vault door, opens a combination lock, pulls the door open and numerous sound effects including various alarms, a foghorn and machine gun noises are heard. Ed, the vault guard, asks ""who goes there?"", and then an exchange is heard where Ed, apparently having been in the vault for a long time, asks ""did we win the war yet?"" When Benny assures Ed that the war had been won, thinking that Ed was referring to World War II, Ed says: ""That's good. What do you think we'll do with the Kaiser?"" Mary arrives while Jack is inspecting his cheese vault, and he emerges wondering who has been pilfering his gorgonzola. A fat rodent version of Don Wilson attempts to deliver a commercial when Jack advises him that this is a movie and not a television program. When Mary suggests a place, Jack's eyes ring up like an old cash register with a dollar sign  and ""no sale"", they discuss other options. As they were discussing the options, the cat writes a message extolling the ""Kit Kat Club""  and sends it to Jack as a paper airplane. Jack and Mary putter off in his Maxwell with Rochester behind the wheel until they reach the Kit Kat Club by following the arrows pointing to it. While enroute, Mary asks for champagne, while Jack says that he prefers a good ""mousecatel"". Unbeknownst to them, the ""club"" is actually the maw of a real cat, and as they enter, the cat's mouth closes on them. Jack cries: ""Help! Help!"" as the camera cuts to the live-action Jack Benny, who wakes up and, breaking the fourth wall, tells the audience: ""Gosh, what a crazy dream! Imagine- Mary and me as two little mice trapped inside a cat's mouth! And me playing the violin!"" At that point, Jack is interrupted by the sound of a discordant ""Rock-a-Bye Baby"" played on the violin, coming from within Jack's live-action cat. From there, the rodent versions of Jack and Mary emerge unharmed from the live-action cat. Following one last bit of animation , the real Jack Benny does one of his famous ""takes"" as the cartoon fades out.
1730420While driving cross-country from Boston to San Diego in their new Jeep Grand Cherokee, Jeff Taylor and his wife Amy narrowly miss colliding with a beat-up Ford F-150 that darts in front of them from an connecting road on a deserted highway. Later, while stopped at a gas station, the truck's driver, Earl, exchanges hostile words with Jeff before the couple resume their journey. Shortly afterwards, their Jeep breaks down in the middle of the desert. Leaving Jeff with the car, Amy accepts a ride from a passing big-rig trucker named Red Barr driving a Peterbilt 385, to get to a nearby diner and call for help. Jeff eventually discovers that the Jeep's battery connections have been suspiciously tampered with, and, after reconnecting them, drives to the diner, only to find that no one has seen his wife. When he catches up with Barr on the road and forces him to stop, the trucker claims he has never seen Jeff or his wife before. Jeff hails a passing sheriff, named Boyd, but a brief search of Barr's truck yields no sign of Amy, and he is let go. Jeff then goes to a police station where he is advised by a deputy to go back to the diner and wait for his wife. There Jeff meets with a simpleton mechanic named Billy, who says he saw Amy arrive in one truck and leave in another. He tells Jeff where they have taken her, but refuses to speak with the police, thinking that they are involved. Jeff heads to the location Billy mentioned, but is ambushed on a back road by Earl, and escapes by driving his Jeep into a river. Abandoning the Jeep and later circling back to watch his attackers salvage the Jeep from the water, Jeff is discovered and knocked out by Billy, an accomplice who had feigned mental impairment earlier. Jeff awakens in a car trunk surrounded by Earl, Billy, another accomplice, Al, a tow-truck driver, and their leader, Red Barr. Red tells Jeff that his wife will be released in exchange for $90,000 that the kidnappers think Jeff has in his bank account. Knowing that he only has a small fraction of the assumed amount, Jeff enters a nearby bank to withdraw what little money he has. After a failed attempt to alert the bank manager to his danger, Jeff steals marked money ribbons and a letter opener from the manager's desk; Jeff uses money ribbons to packet $1 bills in-between two $100 bills, fooling the kidnappers. With the ransom now in hand, Jeff is then instructed by phone to leave town, where he is picked up and bound with duct tape by Earl in his pickup truck. While gloating about how easy Jeff and his wife were to abduct by rigging their car to break down after leaving the gas station, as well as bragging that he intends to kill Jeff and his wife anyway, Earl discovers Jeff's ruse with the ransom. At exactly the same moment, Jeff frees himself and stabs Earl in the chest with the letter opener. After a struggle in the speeding, swerving pickup, Jeff takes over the vehicle, bounds Earl, and forces him to reveal his rendezvous with Red at a local truck stop. Sheriff Boyd appears in his patrol car and, seeing the swerving pickup, calls for backup and stops the vehicle. After Jeff exits the truck with Earl's pistol in hand, a stressed Boyd mistakes the situation and forces Jeff at gunpoint down onto the road. Earl frees himself and shoots Boyd with another pistol concealed in his boot. Just as Earl is about to shoot Jeff, a wounded Boyd shoots and kills Earl. Jeff uses Boyd's radio to call for an ambulance and heads to the truck stop Earl mentioned. At the rest stop, Jeff avoids the police looking for him in connection to the shooting of Boyd, and then spots Red talking on a payphone with another accomplice. Jeff follows Red to his truck where he jumps under the moving truck as Red drives away. Jeff loses his pistol while climbing aboard, but stows away to Red's farm at which he arrives early the next morning. Hiding in a barn, Jeff watches as Red and his remaining accomplices take a bound and gagged Amy and lock her in a freezer in the barn's cellar, leaving her to die. Unable to open the locked cellar door, Jeff finds a gun in Red's truck and uses it to hold Red, his accomplices, and his wife and son at gunpoint, demands the cellar key. Billy escapes, but Jeff forces the rest of the group to safely release Amy from the freezer before locking them in the cellar. Jeff and Amy then flee in a stolen Chevrolet C-20 pickup, while Billy frees Red and Al. They pursue the Taylors in their respective vehicles. During the climactic chase, Billy is killed in a fiery crash when Jeff forces his car off the road, while the trailer from Red's truck detaches, causing Al to violently crash into it. Undeterred, Red attempts to ram Jeff's vehicle off a bridge, trapping Amy's leg underneath the dashboard. Red's big rig nearly falls off the edge and becomes suspended by a steel bridge support. Jeff battles Red on the suspended big rig, eventually hurling Red to the rocks below. Jeff frees Amy from the dashboard in which she  pulls the automatic shift on their pickup, causing the semi to fall on Red and crush him. Sitting on the edge of the bridge beside their mangled pickup truck, Jeff and Amy embrace each other.

12064359 The film is presented as found footage from a personal video camera recovered by the United States Department of Defense. A disclaimer text states that the footage is of a case designated ""Cloverfield"" and was found in the area ""formerly known as Central Park"". The video consists chiefly of segments taped the night of Friday, May 22, 2009. The newer segments were taped over older video that is shown occasionally. The first video segment opens when Rob wakes up on the morning of Monday, April 27 having slept with Beth, a previously platonic friend. They make plans to go to Coney Island that day. The footage cuts to May 22, when Rob's brother Jason and his girlfriend Lily prepare a farewell party for Rob who will be moving to Japan. Their friend Hud uses the camera to film testimonials. After Beth leaves the party, an apparent earthquake strikes, and the city suffers a brief power outage. The local news reports that an oil tanker has capsized near Liberty Island. When the party-goers leave the building, they see the head of the Statue of Liberty crash into the street with several stunning scratch and bite marks. Hud records what appears to be a hand of a large creature several blocks away. The monster causes the Woolworth Building to collapse. Later, during the evacuation of the city, a gigantic tail destroys the Brooklyn Bridge, also killing Jason. News reports show the Army National Guard's 42nd Infantry Division attacking the monster and smaller ""parasite"" creatures falling off its body and attacking people.The creatures are called HSP or ""Human Scale Parasites"" in the Blu-ray special investigation mode.

The three friends regain consciousness and flee the helicopter. As they leave, the monster kills Hud. Rob and Beth grab the camera and take shelter under Greyshot Arch in Central Park as air raid sirens begin to blare and bombing starts. Rob and Beth take turns leaving their last testimonies of the day, which Rob mentions as Saturday, May 23. The bridge crumbles and debris covers the camera.According to the ""military intelligence"" in the special investigation mode of the Blu-ray version, this was the only thing that protected the camera during the Hammer Down protocol The film then cuts to the footage of Rob and Beth's Coney Island date on April 27.

384990Ann  lives in Baton Rouge. She is unhappily married to John  and has never experienced an orgasm. She is seeing a counselor for her problems. Graham Dalton  is an old college friend of John's. He is now a seeming drifter who, after nine years, returns to live in Baton Rouge. Graham arrives to find Ann, who has no idea that John has invited Graham to stay with them until he finds an apartment. When John arrives home, Graham's demeanor becomes remarkably more guarded, due in large part to John's overt disapproval of Graham's bohemian persona. They also discuss the fact that Graham's college girlfriend, Elizabeth, is also living in Baton Rouge. John is sleeping with Ann's sister, Cynthia , a free-spirited bartender. He rationalizes it by blaming Ann's frigidity. He frequently leaves his law office mid-day to meet with Cynthia, instructing his secretary to reschedule clients who are already in the lobby waiting to see him. Ann makes an impromptu visit to Graham's apartment, where she notices stacks of camcorder tapes around the television. When pressed, Graham explains that he interviews women about their sexual experiences and fantasies, on videotape. Ann, overcome with shock and confusion, flees his apartment. Within a day, Cynthia appears at Graham's apartment and introduces herself. Cynthia presses Graham to explain what ""spooked"" Ann the preceding day. Graham explains the videotapes, and admits to Cynthia his sexual dysfunction: that he is impotent when in the presence of another person, and that he achieves gratification by watching these videos in private. Graham propositions Cynthia to make a tape, assuring her that no other person is allowed to see the tapes. She believes him, and agrees. Cynthia reports back to Ann, who is horrified. Cynthia also tells John. When Ann discovers Cynthia's pearl earring in her bedroom, she is furious. She heads over to Graham's apartment with the intention of making a videotape. Graham objects, telling her it is something she would not do in a normal frame of mind. She insists and Graham relents. Afterward, Ann demands a divorce from John. In the ensuing argument, John gleans that Ann has been to Graham's, and that she made a video. He hits Graham and locks him out of the house, then watches Ann's tape. In it, Ann says she has never felt any kind of 'satisfaction' from sex. After Graham asks if she ever thinks of having sex with other men, she admits she has thought of Graham. Ann later turns the camera on Graham. Graham confesses that he is haunted by Elizabeth, and that his motivation in returning to Baton Rouge is a vague notion of reconnecting with her. He explains that he was a pathological liar, which destroyed an otherwise rewarding relationship with Elizabeth. He explains that he has since gone to great lengths to keep people at a distance and avoid relationships. Graham turns off the camera; it is implied that the two have sex. A chastened John joins Graham on the front patio and, with obvious pleasure, confesses to having sex with Elizabeth while she and Graham were a couple. Furious, Graham goes into a rage and destroys all of the tapes, as well as his camera. In the end, John is summoned to his boss's office, where it’s implied that he is about to be fired due to his frequent cancellations of meetings with important clients to have sexual trysts with Cynthia. In the next scene, Ann and Cynthia reconcile at the bar Cynthia tends before Ann returns home and joins Graham on the front porch, as they appear to be a couple.
1430058The film begins with Joe Kavanagh at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, relaying an experience from his past. He states the ritualised greeting: 'My name is Joe and I'm an alcoholic.' He feels that he is not in a position to drink anymore with safety. He tells the group that he copes by praying and states that he is grateful to be at the meeting. He receives a round of applause for his admissions. He goes round to his friend's place, bangs on the door and pretends to be the police. His friends soon realise that they have been tricked. They then travel in Joe's van where they examine stolen sporting merchandise which is of low quality. Joe and his friends stop at another person's house in order to pick up more people. A car cuts off the van. Joe later encounters the driver, whom Joe later describes as being 'the woman who tried to kill us all.' He exits his van and asks the woman if she lost her guide dog. The woman, Sarah, states that she is a health visitor. She wants to see Liam and his child, but Joe explains that Liam has an important football game to attend. The next shot is of the football match. Joe is very encouraging as a coach. The other team appears in white and black, which are the colours that Joe's team wears. Joe's team express their anger at this and respond by taking their shirts off so that they are able to distinguish between players. The other team scores the first goal of the game. Joe drives Liam home and tells Liam to take things one day at a time. Liam abruptly tells Joe to pull over and Liam runs up to a male who acts aggressively towards him. Joe does not hear what transpires between Liam and the man. Later, Joe sees Sarah, who is seen struggling with wallpaper in her car. Joe appears to fancy her, as Sarah tells him her name and he flirts with her. Joe then helps an acquaintance of Sarah's to complete a wall papering and paint job in Sarah's flat. Sarah then leaves the lads to it. She later brings them tea as they paint the ceiling and sing to themselves. They then look outside and notice someone taking photos of them through the window. Joe runs outside with his can of white paint and brush to confront the man who was taking the photos. The photographer tells Joe that he was just doing his job and that he has a bad heart. Joe then paints all over the photographer's car. The car speeds away and manages to knock over a pile of rubbish by the side of the road. Later, Sarah and Joe have dinner together. They are able to make comfortable conversation with one another. There is a bottle of red wine on the table, but Joe does not drink any of the alcohol. Sarah's telephone rings and she leaves the kitchen to answer it. Joe is then left alone with the wine. He clears his plate and appears somewhat nervous. When Sarah finishes with her telephone conversation, Joe asks her about the photographs on her wall. Joe later reveals to Sarah that he does not drink, to which Sarah replies: 'Why didn't you say?' Joe reveals that he is an alcoholic and he has not had a drink in ten months. Joe is happy that Sarah knows and that she has been direct in her responses to him. Joe thanks Sarah for her company. Sarah pays Joe for the work that he completed on her flat and they part company. Joe attends the Mayfield Health Centre. The practice is very busy and the receptionist tries to cope with a patient who is complaining because he has been waiting a long time in order to receive his prescription. Joe tells the receptionist that he would like to see Sarah. The receptionist does not appear to be surprised by his request and says that Joe is free to pop his head around the door. He sees Sarah advising parents on dealing with the changing of nappies. Outside the Health Centre, Joe asks Sarah if she would like to go ten-pin bowling with him and to ring him if she fancies going. They then part company. Sarah speaks with a female colleague, Maggie, and says that Joe seems a bit wild. She states that she is not going to go bowling with Joe. The next shot is of a bowling alley, with 'Spirit in the Sky' playing in the background. Sarah and Joe bowl together and laugh at their many errors. They occupy Aisle 16 and neither of them are spectacular players. They go back to Sarah's place where she asks him in for a cup of tea. Joe politely says no. Sarah offers him money for a taxi. A friendly argument ensues, at the end of which Sarah finds herself locked out of her flat. Sarah says that she can sleep in her car. Joe states that Sarah can sleep at his place, but not necessarily together. They arrive at Joe's and he shows her around his flat. While Joe makes tea for Sarah, she asks him if it is alright to put some music on. She puts on the same piece of music that the audience heard during the opening credits of the film, Beethoven's Violin Concerto in D Major. Joe tells Sarah that he used to be in a band and they won a local talent contest. Joe tells Sarah a story of how he was desperate for a drink one day and what transpired. He went to a music shop and stole some cassettes. He took one of them home and 'got pissed.' He describes the experience as being 'magical.' When Sarah asks him what made him stop drinking, Joe asks her why she wants to know. He is not hostile, but curious. Joe says that he is scared to tell her and that there is a strong chance that she will hate him if he tells. Joe explains that there was a girl he used to drink with and they loved one another. They were both 'just tangled up' and they used to get into terrible arguments and tear one another apart. The audience then sees a flashback where Joe and the girl are returning home from a night out. He states that 'a cloud just descended... really, really dark. And suddenly I hated her. I hated me.' He describes how he tried to open the door, but was unable to; when the partner whom he was with laughed at him, Joe lost control because she found it funny. He beat her by punching and kicking her, while she lay helpless on the ground. He screamed abuse at her. The next day, he had a blackout. Now, he remembers every punch and kick. He states how ashamed and disgusted he is with himself. He is obviously contrite and he has not yet forgiven himself for his actions. In the next shot, Sarah comforts Joe and tells him that it is okay. The next scene is of a football match. Joe sees three men beating up Liam. Joe attempts to intervene. He helps Liam up and asks him if he is still clean. Liam states that he is. Liam confronts his wife when she comes home. He suspects that she has been using and asks her if she 'takes him for a prick.' Liam then yells that he will leave her to rot, grabs her by her neck and forces her to look at herself in the mirror. Joe then attends Liam's flat and encounters Liam's wife shooting up in the bathroom. An argument erupts between them. Joe offers to help her. She does not want the kind of help that Joe offers. Joe then reluctantly assists her to tie off one of her veins so that she can shoot up. Joe tries to make sense of her incoherent mumbles as she lies prostrate in the bathtub. Joe then goes to a snooker club where he asks after Liam's whereabouts. Joe tells one of the men that he encounters that Liam has a four-year-old boy in an attempt to mitigate matters. Liam says that he does not want them to take liberties. He comes across Liam and is cross because Liam told him that he had stopped dealing. A tearful Liam confesses that he still owes money. Joe also tells Liam that he suspects that his wife is on the game. He is worried that people are going to break his legs. Joe and Sarah prepare a meal together, which is interrupted when they have sex. The next day, Joe goes to Stella Maris' B & B in order to deal with the matter of Liam. In a later scene, Joe gives Sarah a pair of earrings, as well as a ring. Joe tells Sarah that he loves her. Sarah tells him that she does not want it and Joe cannot understand what he has done wrong. Joe is confused as to why Sarah has behaved in this fashion. In the next shot, we see a copy of the Alcoholics Anonymous' small blue Bible as Joe listens to Beethoven's Violin Concerto in D Major and makes notes in a book. When Sarah arrives at his door, she apologises. They drink tea together and later embrace. Joe drives his van and his mates direct him to a place where they rob another van. At the outset, Joe does not know where they are going. Joe is shocked with his unwitting role in the robbery of Astral Sports. He still acts as the get-away driver. At the next football match, Joe cleverly remarks that the other team look like budgies because of their blue and yellow striped uniforms. Meanwhile, Sarah reveals to her co-worker Maggie that she is pregnant. Maggie congratulates her. At Sarah's flat, she expresses her reservations about Joe's dealings with Liam. Joe tells her that there are some things that she does not need to know. Joe outlines the limited choices that Liam faces, most of which are not pleasant. Sarah accuses Joe of being a drug dealer and asks where he got the money for her earrings and ring. Joe replies that the gang gave him some money. Sarah becomes enraged and asks, 'Are you going to hit me too, Joe?' Joe attends Liam's flat and states that Liam must deal with things himself. Joe returns to his flat with bottles of Smirnoff Vodka. He pours himself a drink, and takes a sip. Liam then goes to Joe's flat, where Joe is very inebriated. Joe does not understand why Liam has come to see him. Joe calls Liam a 'stupid wee prick.' The alcohol has overtaken Joe and he is hostile to Liam, who needs his help. As Liam witnesses members of the gang coming towards the premises, Liam realises that Joe has passed out and he kisses Joe on his forehead. Joe suddenly snaps awake and realises that Liam has taken his own life by hanging himself. The film concludes with Liam's funeral.

When student interns from the vocational school are allocated to the plumbers, master ZHEK Vostryakovo  doesn't allocate any to him, fearing that he will not teach them well. Afonya begs for trainees and gets two. Having worked with him for one day and having seen his attitude and working methods, the trainees refuse to work with him anymore. The next day, Kolya arrives to live at Afonya's, having been thrown out of his house by his wife. At a dance Afonya meets young nurse Katya Snegireva , who knows about him through her brother, who used to play in Afonya's volleyball team. Afonya doesn't pay her much attention, because he's more interested in older women and already has his eye on one at the dance. However, a romantic walk with the older woman after the dance is over before it begins – Afonya is challenged to a fight by a hooligan, who he'd quarrelled with at the dance. The hooligan's friends join in, and finish the unequal fight. Katya worries for Afonya's safety, and calls the militia - which will only bring Anfonya to the committee's attention again. At a regular work call Borshchov meets Helen  and falls in love at first sight. He starts finding any excuse to work in her flat - even fooling a tenant, astronomer , by swapping his new Finnish sink for an old one, so he can install the Finnish sink in Helen's home as a gift. In his dreams Athos sees a family idyll with his wife Helen and their perfect children. Katya Snegireva, head over heels for Afonya, keeps engineering new meetings with him, and stops at nothing to attract his attention: ""Athanasius! someone called, I thought it was – you ... "". Afonya is completely oblivious to her feelings. Meanwhile Afonya's run in with the militia catches up with him and, for persistent drunkenness, truancy and fighting Afonya is threatened with being sacked at a meeting of the local committee. In addition, if he doesn't restore the Finnish sink he's definitely going to be fired. Afonya takes a porcelain sink with flowers to Helen to swap with the Finnish sink, but meets Helen coming home with company. She makes her feelings quite clear: she has her own life among fashionable and wealthy men, and Afonya is just a plumber. Afonya, depressed, goes to a restaurant with Fedulov and tries to escape into drunkenness, but it doesn't help. In his drunken state he goes to Katya Snegireva's home and proposes marriage, and wakes up next to her in the morning. Katya tells him she's due to move to Africa with work and wonders if she should cancel for Afonya. Afonya then decides to go back to his village, to his aunt Frosya , who brought him up. In the village, he meets his childhood friend Concertina  and, in a joyous moment sends the city a telegram resigning from his job and giving up his apartment. Only then does he learn that Aunt Frosya died two years ago. Afonya's depression increases – he has lost everything and has nowhere to go. Neighbour Uncle Yegor  gives Athos his Aunt Frosya's legacy – savings account in his name, the deeds to her house, and the letters she'd sent to herself, pretending they were from Afonya to the neighbours . The guilt of having ignored her only increases his gloom. Athanasius goes to the post office and tries to call Katya Snegireva on her memorable phone number 50-50-2, or as he says himself, ""rug-rug or two."" The answer comes back - Katya has left. Finally frustrated, he goes to the airport. He does not care where he's going or what will happen to him. Things have gotten so bad that a local militia man has to be convinced Afonya is the man in his passport photograph, so grim has he gotten since it was taken. Finally, just when Athanasius is heading to the AN-2 aircraft , a familiar girlish voice calls out. It's Katya, suitcase in hand: ""Athanasius!, someone called, I thought it was – you ... "

1273501Early in the Second World War, a raiding party of six Nazi sailors, caught ashore when their U-boat is sunk in Hudson Bay, attempt to evade capture by travelling across Canada to the still-neutral United States. The film's title comes from the 49th parallel north which marks part of the border between the two countries. Led by Lieutenants Hirth  and Kuhnecke , the small band of sailors encounter and sometimes brutalize a wide range of people, including the Eskimo Nick , the French-Canadian trapper , the floatplane crew and local Eskimo onlookers, pacifistic German Hutterite farmers, an innocent motorist, and the eccentric English academic and author ([[Leslie Howard . Making their way across Canada first using a stolen seaplane, the five surviving members of the Nazi band try to stir up sympathy among the Hutterite community outside Winnipeg, believing them to be countrymen. Lieutenant Hirth's stirring speech is rejected by Peter , the community's leader, and even by one of their own, Vogel , who comes to the aid of Anna . Vogel is tried by Lieutenant Hirth and summarily executed for the greater crime of trying to break away from the Nazi group. Hijacking an innocent motorist for his automobile, Hirth, Lohrmann and Kranz flee West. With all of Canada searching for them, and having killed 11 civilians along the way, Lohrmann is arrested by Canadian Mounties at a public gathering. Next, Kranz  is knocked out cold by writer Phillip A-Scott  in a cave - despite having been wounded. Finally, the story comes to a head with a confrontation on a freight train between Hirth, the sole remaining fugitive at large, and AWOL Canadian soldier Andy Brock . When Hirth learns the train has crossed into the United States, he surrenders his gun to a customs official and demands to be taken to the German embassy in the U.S. . However, Brock points out that Hirth is locked in the freight hold, but is not listed on the freight manifest, and convinces both American customs officials instead, that the freight car together with Hirth and Brock be sent back to Canada as ""improperly manifested cargo"" - which they readily comply with. The film ends with the train reversing to Canada and Brock about to pummel Hirth in the boxcar.

13379536The book club is the brainchild of fiftysomething six-time divorcée Bernadette, who latches onto the idea when she meets Prudie, a prim, married high school French teacher in her mid-20s, at a Jane Austen film festival. Her concept is to have six members discuss all of Austen's six novels, with each member hosting the group once a month. Also inducted into the club are Sylvia, a fortysomething librarian who recently has separated from her philandering lawyer husband Daniel after more than two decades of marriage; Sylvia's 20-something lesbian daughter Allegra; Jocelyn, a happily unmarried control freak and breeder of Rhodesian Ridgebacks who has been Sylvia's friend since childhood; and Grigg, a science fiction fan who's roped into the group by Jocelyn with the hope he and Sylvia will prove to be a compatible match. As the months pass, each of the members develops characteristics similar to those of Austen's characters and reacts to events in their lives in much the same way their fictional counterparts would. Bernadette is the matriarch figure who longs to see everyone find happiness. Sylvia clings to her belief in steadfast love and devotion, and eventually reconciles with Daniel. Jocelyn denies her own feelings for Grigg while playing matchmaker for him and Sylvia. Prudie, encumbered with her inattentive husband Dean and a free-spirited, pot-smoking, aging-hippie mother, a product of the 1960s counterculture, finds herself desperately trying not to succumb to her feelings for her seductive student Trey. Allegra, who tends to meet her lovers while engaging in death-defying activities, feels betrayed when she discovers her current partner, aspiring writer Corinne, has used Allegra's life as the basis for her short stories. Grigg is attracted to Jocelyn and mystified by her seeming lack of interest in him, marked by her failure to read the Ursula K. Le Guin novels he has hoped will catch her fancy. He also serves as the comedic foil to Jocelyn and Prudie's very serious takes on the books.

1937542Living In Oblivion is divided into three parts, all of which concern the making of a low-budget movie featuring the same director, crew and substantially the same cast. Part one: Director Nick Reve  is shooting a low-budget independent film in the middle of New York City. The catering crew are under-funded and apathetic, deciding not to replace a carton of milk that has been on the craft service table for a week. The scene being shot is a difficult one: a young woman, Ellen, reproaches her elderly mother  for not intervening when the father beat Ellen as a child. However, on the set, just about everything that can go wrong does go wrong: shots are spoiled because of the mic boom is visible; the camera assistant fails to keep the shot in focus; Cora, the actress playing the mother, forgets her lines; and Nicole, the actress playing Ellen, becomes increasingly unfocused and careless. A dispirited Nick calls for a rehearsal without camera to refresh the actors. However, when Nicole  berates herself for acting badly, Cora  reassures her with a gesture that reminds Nicole of a similar gesture made by her own terminally ill mother. Nicole is so upset by the memory that she turns in an unexpectedly passionate performance; and Cora, startled by Nicole's sudden intensity, is equally good. Watching them, Nick becomes enthusiastic all over again. Unfortunately, it was not captured on film; cinematographer and camera operator Wolf , who has been diluting the sub-standard coffee with the spoiled milk, was vomiting in the toilet throughout. Nick ruefully calls for another take. This time, a sudden and insistent beeping sound distracts the actors. Nobody can tell where it's coming from; and Nick flies into a rage, berating everyone on the crew and cast for their inadequacies. He then wakes up in his own bed; the beeping sound was his own alarm clock. He has dreamed the entire segment. It is 4.30am; and he is due on set. Part two: Early the same morning, the film's lead actor Chad Palomino  is getting dressed in Nicole's hotel room. They have spent the night together, and Chad suggests that they might get together again later; Nicole politely declines. Chad and Nicole arrive on the set separately. Nicole's character Ellen and Chad's character Damian have been in love for years but have never admitted it until the scene being shot on this day. Shooting the scene is made practically impossible by Chad's irregular acting. He keeps changing his mind about where to stand and continually moves to places where he is either invisible or badly lit by scenic light. Nicole becomes increasingly frustrated by Chad's egomania; and, when he starts to stroke her head, she briefly loses her cool, then apologizes. An irritated Chad demands a private talk with Nick. He tells Nick that he has slept with Nicole and makes out that it was she, not he, who had wanted to continue the relationship. Desperate to keep Chad happy, Nick agrees that Nicole is not very good. Nicole overhears this conversation on the sound mixer's headphones. Pretending to be contrite, she asks Nick if they can improvise a little; but, when they do so, she announces to everyone that, although she slept with Chad, she is not at all interested in him. Chad loses his temper and quits the movie. Relieved that he will no longer have to please Chad, Nick calls him a ""Hostess Twinkie motherfucker"" and a fight breaks out. Nick beats Chad senseless and fires him. He apologises to Nicole and confesses that he loves her. They kiss—then Nicole abruptly wakes up, still in her bed, having dreamed the whole thing. Part three: Later the same day, the crew is setting up for a dream sequence in which Nicole, as Ellen, stands still while a dwarf walks around her holding an apple. Nick claims to have learned a lesson from his own dream: That sometimes, ""you just got to roll with things."" Nicole admits that she had a dream with Nick in it but doesn't tell him what happened. Nick manages to keep up his positive attitude despite the various mishaps that occur: The smoke machine fails to work, then it catches fire, then his senile mother Cora arrives on the set. However, the ill-tempered dwarf actor Tito  complains that the dream sequence is a cliché  and walks off the set in disgust. Nick's confidence collapses, and he announces that the movie is over. At that moment, his mother intervenes, grabbing the apple, moving to Tito's mark and announcing that she is ""ready"". The crew scrambles to shoot the scene, and her manic performance injects fresh energy and conviction into it. Nick is delighted and decides to keep the new dream sequence, and there is a tense moment while the sound mixer records 30 seconds of room tone. The entire cast and crew manages to remain silent, and they go on to shooting the next sequence.
31555231In flashback, Niall , a local news reporter, recalls visiting his mother's grave, as he smartens up in a toilet mirror. His colleague Tammy  knocks on the toilet door to hurry him up and as they walk to the car she instructs him on the art of the 'death-knock': knocking on the doors of the recently bereaved to obtain quotes and pictures of the deceased for the newspaper. Niall's poor track record has put his job on the line and Tammy has been detailed to improve his hit-rate. When they reach the house of Mrs Wright, who has lost her son in a car accident, Niall goes in first while Tammy waits outside. Before Niall can introduce himself and launch into his spiel that Tammy has prepared for him, Mrs Wright  interrupts him - ""I know who you are"" - and ushers him into the house. There she ropes him into unstacking the dishwasher as Niall tries in vain to broach the subject of the bereavement against the sound of a fire alarm which has been set off by the cigarette Mrs Wright is smoking. Mrs Wright appears baffled by Niall's requests for pictures and instead offers him some soup telling him they will look at some pictures ""in the morning"", much to Niall's surprise. She then leads him upstairs to the bedroom and encourages him to get some rest. Trapped in the bedroom, Niall examines the dead boy's belongings and finds himself playing with his toys. Meanwhile, Tammy waits outside taking a phone call from her boss at the newspaper, to whom she explains that Niall ""is still in there, so he must be doing alright"". Whilst playing with a light sabre, Niall knocks off a shelf-load of items and as he picks them up, he finds a photo of the dead boy. Mrs Wright, alerted by the noise, appears behind him and embracing Niall, she tells him: ""it's been a long day: time for bed."" Tammy knocks at the door and attempts to talk to Mrs Wright about the accident in which her son was killed, but Mrs Wright replies that her son is in his room and that there must be some mistake. Closing the door, she is nonetheless shaken by Tammy's insistence that her son is dead and she climbs the stairs to the bedroom where she finds Niall tucked up fast asleep in her son's bed. She kisses him on the cheek and switches out the light.
384141The story revolves around a farmer Shambu Mahato , who lives with his wife Parvati `Paro’  and son Kanhaiya  in a small village that has been hit badly by a famine. After years of drought, the region finally gets rain, leading to the farmers to rejoice. Shambu owns two bighas  of land, which is the only means of livelihood for the whole family. The local zamindar  Thakur Harnam Singh ([[Murad  partners with some city business men to construct a mill on his large parcel of land, which in return would profit them and bring prosperity to the village. The only problem is that in the middle of Harnam singh's land lay Shambu's meager two bighas of land. Harnam Singh is very confident that he could buy Shambu's land. Shambu has borrowed money from Harnam Singh several times in the past and has not paid back his debt. Harnam Singh calls for Shambu and proposes Shambu to sell his land to him in exchange for his debt. Shambu disagrees to sell his only livelihood and Harnam Singh gets upset.

When Shambu meets Harman Singh's accountant to pay back his debt of 65 rupees, he's shocked to know that he actually owes 235 rupees. The accountant had forged the accounts and now refuses to consider the labor provided by Shambu's father Gangu as portion of debt payoff. The case goes to court and Shambu being an illiterate, has a tough time explaining to the judge how the accountant forged the numbers and how he took accountant's word of mouth and did not demand any receipt. Shambu loses the case, however the judge orders Shambu to pay back 235 rupees to Harnam Singh in three months. If Shambu is not able to pay back his debt, then his land would be auctioned off and the proceeds would go to pay off his debts. Shambu now struggles to get the money and he is unable to get a loan because he has no collaterals. One of his village friends gives him an idea to go to Calcutta  and try to get a job to earn enough money to pay off his debt. Shambu likes this idea, but faces resistance from his wife as she's pregnant and does not want to live away from him.

20841547Somewhere in Beverly Hills, in the house of Jack Benny , a mouse version of Jack is practicing his violin---off key---and saying to himself, ""Who is this guy Isaac Stern?""  Outside Jack's mouse hole, a cat is lying in wait, wearing ear muffs to filter out the discordant sound of Jack's violin. Jack calls his servant, Rochester  to get his white suit, which Rochester is wearing at the time. Jack tells the valet that his rental period is up  and he needs the suit because he is taking Mary Livingstone out for her birthday, and, true to character, is looking for a good cheap restaurant. While waiting for Mary, Jack decides to count his cheese in a basement vault. Using a coin on a string, he opens the lock, which appears to be a coin-operated lock from a pay toilet. As soon as he walks through the door, he takes a cane from a nail on the wall and starts humming We're in the Money. When he reaches the bottom of the stairs, he reaches through a hole and trips a razor blade hanging above the passageway like a guillotine. He then comes up to a derringer and uses the cane to trip the trigger on the derringer. Finally, he comes up to another hole, reaches through with the cane and trips a mousetrap. He then reaches the vault door, opens a combination lock, pulls the door open and numerous sound effects including various alarms, a foghorn and machine gun noises are heard. Ed, the vault guard, asks ""who goes there?"", and then an exchange is heard where Ed, apparently having been in the vault for a long time, asks ""did we win the war yet?"" When Benny assures Ed that the war had been won, thinking that Ed was referring to World War II, Ed says: ""That's good. What do you think we'll do with the Kaiser?"" Mary arrives while Jack is inspecting his cheese vault, and he emerges wondering who has been pilfering his gorgonzola. A fat rodent version of Don Wilson attempts to deliver a commercial when Jack advises him that this is a movie and not a television program. When Mary suggests a place, Jack's eyes ring up like an old cash register with a dollar sign  and ""no sale"", they discuss other options. As they were discussing the options, the cat writes a message extolling the ""Kit Kat Club""  and sends it to Jack as a paper airplane. Jack and Mary putter off in his Maxwell with Rochester behind the wheel until they reach the Kit Kat Club by following the arrows pointing to it. While enroute, Mary asks for champagne, while Jack says that he prefers a good ""mousecatel"". Unbeknownst to them, the ""club"" is actually the maw of a real cat, and as they enter, the cat's mouth closes on them. Jack cries: ""Help! Help!"" as the camera cuts to the live-action Jack Benny, who wakes up and, breaking the fourth wall, tells the audience: ""Gosh, what a crazy dream! Imagine- Mary and me as two little mice trapped inside a cat's mouth! And me playing the violin!"" At that point, Jack is interrupted by the sound of a discordant ""Rock-a-Bye Baby"" played on the violin, coming from within Jack's live-action cat. From there, the rodent versions of Jack and Mary emerge unharmed from the live-action cat. Following one last bit of animation , the real Jack Benny does one of his famous ""takes"" as the cartoon fades out.
1730420While driving cross-country from Boston to San Diego in their new Jeep Grand Cherokee, Jeff Taylor and his wife Amy narrowly miss colliding with a beat-up Ford F-150 that darts in front of them from an connecting road on a deserted highway. Later, while stopped at a gas station, the truck's driver, Earl, exchanges hostile words with Jeff before the couple resume their journey. Shortly afterwards, their Jeep breaks down in the middle of the desert. Leaving Jeff with the car, Amy accepts a ride from a passing big-rig trucker named Red Barr driving a Peterbilt 385, to get to a nearby diner and call for help. Jeff eventually discovers that the Jeep's battery connections have been suspiciously tampered with, and, after reconnecting them, drives to the diner, only to find that no one has seen his wife. When he catches up with Barr on the road and forces him to stop, the trucker claims he has never seen Jeff or his wife before. Jeff hails a passing sheriff, named Boyd, but a brief search of Barr's truck yields no sign of Amy, and he is let go. Jeff then goes to a police station where he is advised by a deputy to go back to the diner and wait for his wife. There Jeff meets with a simpleton mechanic named Billy, who says he saw Amy arrive in one truck and leave in another. He tells Jeff where they have taken her, but refuses to speak with the police, thinking that they are involved. Jeff heads to the location Billy mentioned, but is ambushed on a back road by Earl, and escapes by driving his Jeep into a river. Abandoning the Jeep and later circling back to watch his attackers salvage the Jeep from the water, Jeff is discovered and knocked out by Billy, an accomplice who had feigned mental impairment earlier. Jeff awakens in a car trunk surrounded by Earl, Billy, another accomplice, Al, a tow-truck driver, and their leader, Red Barr. Red tells Jeff that his wife will be released in exchange for $90,000 that the kidnappers think Jeff has in his bank account. Knowing that he only has a small fraction of the assumed amount, Jeff enters a nearby bank to withdraw what little money he has. After a failed attempt to alert the bank manager to his danger, Jeff steals marked money ribbons and a letter opener from the manager's desk; Jeff uses money ribbons to packet $1 bills in-between two $100 bills, fooling the kidnappers. With the ransom now in hand, Jeff is then instructed by phone to leave town, where he is picked up and bound with duct tape by Earl in his pickup truck. While gloating about how easy Jeff and his wife were to abduct by rigging their car to break down after leaving the gas station, as well as bragging that he intends to kill Jeff and his wife anyway, Earl discovers Jeff's ruse with the ransom. At exactly the same moment, Jeff frees himself and stabs Earl in the chest with the letter opener. After a struggle in the speeding, swerving pickup, Jeff takes over the vehicle, bounds Earl, and forces him to reveal his rendezvous with Red at a local truck stop. Sheriff Boyd appears in his patrol car and, seeing the swerving pickup, calls for backup and stops the vehicle. After Jeff exits the truck with Earl's pistol in hand, a stressed Boyd mistakes the situation and forces Jeff at gunpoint down onto the road. Earl frees himself and shoots Boyd with another pistol concealed in his boot. Just as Earl is about to shoot Jeff, a wounded Boyd shoots and kills Earl. Jeff uses Boyd's radio to call for an ambulance and heads to the truck stop Earl mentioned. At the rest stop, Jeff avoids the police looking for him in connection to the shooting of Boyd, and then spots Red talking on a payphone with another accomplice. Jeff follows Red to his truck where he jumps under the moving truck as Red drives away. Jeff loses his pistol while climbing aboard, but stows away to Red's farm at which he arrives early the next morning. Hiding in a barn, Jeff watches as Red and his remaining accomplices take a bound and gagged Amy and lock her in a freezer in the barn's cellar, leaving her to die. Unable to open the locked cellar door, Jeff finds a gun in Red's truck and uses it to hold Red, his accomplices, and his wife and son at gunpoint, demands the cellar key. Billy escapes, but Jeff forces the rest of the group to safely release Amy from the freezer before locking them in the cellar. Jeff and Amy then flee in a stolen Chevrolet C-20 pickup, while Billy frees Red and Al. They pursue the Taylors in their respective vehicles. During the climactic chase, Billy is killed in a fiery crash when Jeff forces his car off the road, while the trailer from Red's truck detaches, causing Al to violently crash into it. Undeterred, Red attempts to ram Jeff's vehicle off a bridge, trapping Amy's leg underneath the dashboard. Red's big rig nearly falls off the edge and becomes suspended by a steel bridge support. Jeff battles Red on the suspended big rig, eventually hurling Red to the rocks below. Jeff frees Amy from the dashboard in which she  pulls the automatic shift on their pickup, causing the semi to fall on Red and crush him. Sitting on the edge of the bridge beside their mangled pickup truck, Jeff and Amy embrace each other.

12064359 The film is presented as found footage from a personal video camera recovered by the United States Department of Defense. A disclaimer text states that the footage is of a case designated ""Cloverfield"" and was found in the area ""formerly known as Central Park"". The video consists chiefly of segments taped the night of Friday, May 22, 2009. The newer segments were taped over older video that is shown occasionally. The first video segment opens when Rob wakes up on the morning of Monday, April 27 having slept with Beth, a previously platonic friend. They make plans to go to Coney Island that day. The footage cuts to May 22, when Rob's brother Jason and his girlfriend Lily prepare a farewell party for Rob who will be moving to Japan. Their friend Hud uses the camera to film testimonials. After Beth leaves the party, an apparent earthquake strikes, and the city suffers a brief power outage. The local news reports that an oil tanker has capsized near Liberty Island. When the party-goers leave the building, they see the head of the Statue of Liberty crash into the street with several stunning scratch and bite marks. Hud records what appears to be a hand of a large creature several blocks away. The monster causes the Woolworth Building to collapse. Later, during the evacuation of the city, a gigantic tail destroys the Brooklyn Bridge, also killing Jason. News reports show the Army National Guard's 42nd Infantry Division attacking the monster and smaller ""parasite"" creatures falling off its body and attacking people.The creatures are called HSP or ""Human Scale Parasites"" in the Blu-ray special investigation mode. Rob listens to a phone message from Beth saying she is trapped in her apartment and unable to move. Going against the crowd, Rob, Hud, Lily, and Marlena  venture to Midtown Manhattan to rescue Beth. They are attacked by several of the ""parasite"" creatures; Marlena is bitten by one of them. They come across a command center and field hospital, where Marlena dies. One of the military leaders tells the group when the last evacuation helicopter will depart before the military executes its ""Hammer Down Protocol"", which will destroy Manhattan. The group rescues Beth, who was impaled on a piece of rebar. The four make their way to the evacuation site, where they encounter the monster once more over Grand Central Terminal. Lily is raced into one departing Marine Corps helicopter. Moments later, Rob, Beth and Hud are taken away in a second helicopter and witness a U.S. Air Force B-2 Spirit bomb the monster. The monster falls, then lunges at the helicopter, causing it to crash into Central Park.  The film skips to less than an hour later, with a voice on the crashed helicopter's radio warning that the Hammer Down protocol will begin in 15 minutes. The three friends regain consciousness and flee the helicopter. As they leave, the monster kills Hud. Rob and Beth grab the camera and take shelter under Greyshot Arch in Central Park as air raid sirens begin to blare and bombing starts. Rob and Beth take turns leaving their last testimonies of the day, which Rob mentions as Saturday, May 23. The bridge crumbles and debris covers the camera.According to the ""military intelligence"" in the special investigation mode of the Blu-ray version, this was the only thing that protected the camera during the Hammer Down protocol The film then cuts to the footage of Rob and Beth's Coney Island date on April 27. In the distance, unnoticed by Rob and Beth, a large object falls into the ocean.

384990Ann  lives in Baton Rouge. She is unhappily married to John  and has never experienced an orgasm. She is seeing a counselor for her problems. Graham Dalton  is an old college friend of John's. He is now a seeming drifter who, after nine years, returns to live in Baton Rouge. Graham arrives to find Ann, who has no idea that John has invited Graham to stay with them until he finds an apartment. When John arrives home, Graham's demeanor becomes remarkably more guarded, due in large part to John's overt disapproval of Graham's bohemian persona. They also discuss the fact that Graham's college girlfriend, Elizabeth, is also living in Baton Rouge. John is sleeping with Ann's sister, Cynthia , a free-spirited bartender. He rationalizes it by blaming Ann's frigidity. He frequently leaves his law office mid-day to meet with Cynthia, instructing his secretary to reschedule clients who are already in the lobby waiting to see him. Ann makes an impromptu visit to Graham's apartment, where she notices stacks of camcorder tapes around the television. When pressed, Graham explains that he interviews women about their sexual experiences and fantasies, on videotape. Ann, overcome with shock and confusion, flees his apartment. Within a day, Cynthia appears at Graham's apartment and introduces herself. Cynthia presses Graham to explain what ""spooked"" Ann the preceding day. Graham explains the videotapes, and admits to Cynthia his sexual dysfunction: that he is impotent when in the presence of another person, and that he achieves gratification by watching these videos in private. Graham propositions Cynthia to make a tape, assuring her that no other person is allowed to see the tapes. She believes him, and agrees. Cynthia reports back to Ann, who is horrified. Cynthia also tells John. When Ann discovers Cynthia's pearl earring in her bedroom, she is furious. She heads over to Graham's apartment with the intention of making a videotape. Graham objects, telling her it is something she would not do in a normal frame of mind. She insists and Graham relents. Afterward, Ann demands a divorce from John. In the ensuing argument, John gleans that Ann has been to Graham's, and that she made a video. He hits Graham and locks him out of the house, then watches Ann's tape. In it, Ann says she has never felt any kind of 'satisfaction' from sex. After Graham asks if she ever thinks of having sex with other men, she admits she has thought of Graham. Ann later turns the camera on Graham. Graham confesses that he is haunted by Elizabeth, and that his motivation in returning to Baton Rouge is a vague notion of reconnecting with her. He explains that he was a pathological liar, which destroyed an otherwise rewarding relationship with Elizabeth. He explains that he has since gone to great lengths to keep people at a distance and avoid relationships. Graham turns off the camera; it is implied that the two have sex. A chastened John joins Graham on the front patio and, with obvious pleasure, confesses to having sex with Elizabeth while she and Graham were a couple. Furious, Graham goes into a rage and destroys all of the tapes, as well as his camera. In the end, John is summoned to his boss's office, where it’s implied that he is about to be fired due to his frequent cancellations of meetings with important clients to have sexual trysts with Cynthia. In the next scene, Ann and Cynthia reconcile at the bar Cynthia tends before Ann returns home and joins Graham on the front porch, as they appear to be a couple.
1430058The film begins with Joe Kavanagh at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, relaying an experience from his past. He states the ritualised greeting: 'My name is Joe and I'm an alcoholic.' He feels that he is not in a position to drink anymore with safety. He tells the group that he copes by praying and states that he is grateful to be at the meeting. He receives a round of applause for his admissions. He goes round to his friend's place, bangs on the door and pretends to be the police. His friends soon realise that they have been tricked. They then travel in Joe's van where they examine stolen sporting merchandise which is of low quality. Joe and his friends stop at another person's house in order to pick up more people. A car cuts off the van. Joe later encounters the driver, whom Joe later describes as being 'the woman who tried to kill us all.' He exits his van and asks the woman if she lost her guide dog. The woman, Sarah, states that she is a health visitor. She wants to see Liam and his child, but Joe explains that Liam has an important football game to attend. The next shot is of the football match. Joe is very encouraging as a coach. The other team appears in white and black, which are the colours that Joe's team wears. Joe's team express their anger at this and respond by taking their shirts off so that they are able to distinguish between players. The other team scores the first goal of the game. Joe drives Liam home and tells Liam to take things one day at a time. Liam abruptly tells Joe to pull over and Liam runs up to a male who acts aggressively towards him. Joe does not hear what transpires between Liam and the man. Later, Joe sees Sarah, who is seen struggling with wallpaper in her car. Joe appears to fancy her, as Sarah tells him her name and he flirts with her. Joe then helps an acquaintance of Sarah's to complete a wall papering and paint job in Sarah's flat. Sarah then leaves the lads to it. She later brings them tea as they paint the ceiling and sing to themselves. They then look outside and notice someone taking photos of them through the window. Joe runs outside with his can of white paint and brush to confront the man who was taking the photos. The photographer tells Joe that he was just doing his job and that he has a bad heart. Joe then paints all over the photographer's car. The car speeds away and manages to knock over a pile of rubbish by the side of the road. Later, Sarah and Joe have dinner together. They are able to make comfortable conversation with one another. There is a bottle of red wine on the table, but Joe does not drink any of the alcohol. Sarah's telephone rings and she leaves the kitchen to answer it. Joe is then left alone with the wine. He clears his plate and appears somewhat nervous. When Sarah finishes with her telephone conversation, Joe asks her about the photographs on her wall. Joe later reveals to Sarah that he does not drink, to which Sarah replies: 'Why didn't you say?' Joe reveals that he is an alcoholic and he has not had a drink in ten months. Joe is happy that Sarah knows and that she has been direct in her responses to him. Joe thanks Sarah for her company. Sarah pays Joe for the work that he completed on her flat and they part company. Joe attends the Mayfield Health Centre. The practice is very busy and the receptionist tries to cope with a patient who is complaining because he has been waiting a long time in order to receive his prescription. Joe tells the receptionist that he would like to see Sarah. The receptionist does not appear to be surprised by his request and says that Joe is free to pop his head around the door. He sees Sarah advising parents on dealing with the changing of nappies. Outside the Health Centre, Joe asks Sarah if she would like to go ten-pin bowling with him and to ring him if she fancies going. They then part company. Sarah speaks with a female colleague, Maggie, and says that Joe seems a bit wild. She states that she is not going to go bowling with Joe. The next shot is of a bowling alley, with 'Spirit in the Sky' playing in the background. Sarah and Joe bowl together and laugh at their many errors. They occupy Aisle 16 and neither of them are spectacular players. They go back to Sarah's place where she asks him in for a cup of tea. Joe politely says no. Sarah offers him money for a taxi. A friendly argument ensues, at the end of which Sarah finds herself locked out of her flat. Sarah says that she can sleep in her car. Joe states that Sarah can sleep at his place, but not necessarily together. They arrive at Joe's and he shows her around his flat. While Joe makes tea for Sarah, she asks him if it is alright to put some music on. She puts on the same piece of music that the audience heard during the opening credits of the film, Beethoven's Violin Concerto in D Major. Joe tells Sarah that he used to be in a band and they won a local talent contest. Joe tells Sarah a story of how he was desperate for a drink one day and what transpired. He went to a music shop and stole some cassettes. He took one of them home and 'got pissed.' He describes the experience as being 'magical.' When Sarah asks him what made him stop drinking, Joe asks her why she wants to know. He is not hostile, but curious. Joe says that he is scared to tell her and that there is a strong chance that she will hate him if he tells. Joe explains that there was a girl he used to drink with and they loved one another. They were both 'just tangled up' and they used to get into terrible arguments and tear one another apart. The audience then sees a flashback where Joe and the girl are returning home from a night out. He states that 'a cloud just descended... really, really dark. And suddenly I hated her. I hated me.' He describes how he tried to open the door, but was unable to; when the partner whom he was with laughed at him, Joe lost control because she found it funny. He beat her by punching and kicking her, while she lay helpless on the ground. He screamed abuse at her. The next day, he had a blackout. Now, he remembers every punch and kick. He states how ashamed and disgusted he is with himself. He is obviously contrite and he has not yet forgiven himself for his actions. In the next shot, Sarah comforts Joe and tells him that it is okay. The next scene is of a football match. Joe sees three men beating up Liam. Joe attempts to intervene. He helps Liam up and asks him if he is still clean. Liam states that he is. Liam confronts his wife when she comes home. He suspects that she has been using and asks her if she 'takes him for a prick.' Liam then yells that he will leave her to rot, grabs her by her neck and forces her to look at herself in the mirror. Joe then attends Liam's flat and encounters Liam's wife shooting up in the bathroom. An argument erupts between them. Joe offers to help her. She does not want the kind of help that Joe offers. Joe then reluctantly assists her to tie off one of her veins so that she can shoot up. Joe tries to make sense of her incoherent mumbles as she lies prostrate in the bathtub. Joe then goes to a snooker club where he asks after Liam's whereabouts. Joe tells one of the men that he encounters that Liam has a four-year-old boy in an attempt to mitigate matters. Liam says that he does not want them to take liberties. He comes across Liam and is cross because Liam told him that he had stopped dealing. A tearful Liam confesses that he still owes money. Joe also tells Liam that he suspects that his wife is on the game. He is worried that people are going to break his legs. Joe and Sarah prepare a meal together, which is interrupted when they have sex. The next day, Joe goes to Stella Maris' B & B in order to deal with the matter of Liam. In a later scene, Joe gives Sarah a pair of earrings, as well as a ring. Joe tells Sarah that he loves her. Sarah tells him that she does not want it and Joe cannot understand what he has done wrong. Joe is confused as to why Sarah has behaved in this fashion. In the next shot, we see a copy of the Alcoholics Anonymous' small blue Bible as Joe listens to Beethoven's Violin Concerto in D Major and makes notes in a book. When Sarah arrives at his door, she apologises. They drink tea together and later embrace. Joe drives his van and his mates direct him to a place where they rob another van. At the outset, Joe does not know where they are going. Joe is shocked with his unwitting role in the robbery of Astral Sports. He still acts as the get-away driver. At the next football match, Joe cleverly remarks that the other team look like budgies because of their blue and yellow striped uniforms. Meanwhile, Sarah reveals to her co-worker Maggie that she is pregnant. Maggie congratulates her. At Sarah's flat, she expresses her reservations about Joe's dealings with Liam. Joe tells her that there are some things that she does not need to know. Joe outlines the limited choices that Liam faces, most of which are not pleasant. Sarah accuses Joe of being a drug dealer and asks where he got the money for her earrings and ring. Joe replies that the gang gave him some money. Sarah becomes enraged and asks, 'Are you going to hit me too, Joe?' Joe attends Liam's flat and states that Liam must deal with things himself. Joe returns to his flat with bottles of Smirnoff Vodka. He pours himself a drink, and takes a sip. Liam then goes to Joe's flat, where Joe is very inebriated. Joe does not understand why Liam has come to see him. Joe calls Liam a 'stupid wee prick.' The alcohol has overtaken Joe and he is hostile to Liam, who needs his help. As Liam witnesses members of the gang coming towards the premises, Liam realises that Joe has passed out and he kisses Joe on his forehead. Joe suddenly snaps awake and realises that Liam has taken his own life by hanging himself. The film concludes with Liam's funeral.
6189444Unlucky plumber – Athanasius Borshchov   and his friend Fedulov  spend all day and night avoiding work and finding opportunities to drink. Afonya takes ""kickbacks"" from clients and is often in trouble with the local committee for his behaviour. Afonya meets plasterer Kolya  in a pub, gets drunk and comes home. When his girlfriend sees the state he's in, she leaves him. The next morning he can't even remember yesterday's drinking companion. Things continue to go downhill for Afonya. When student interns from the vocational school are allocated to the plumbers, master ZHEK Vostryakovo  doesn't allocate any to him, fearing that he will not teach them well. Afonya begs for trainees and gets two. Having worked with him for one day and having seen his attitude and working methods, the trainees refuse to work with him anymore. The next day, Kolya arrives to live at Afonya's, having been thrown out of his house by his wife. At a dance Afonya meets young nurse Katya Snegireva , who knows about him through her brother, who used to play in Afonya's volleyball team. Afonya doesn't pay her much attention, because he's more interested in older women and already has his eye on one at the dance. However, a romantic walk with the older woman after the dance is over before it begins – Afonya is challenged to a fight by a hooligan, who he'd quarrelled with at the dance. The hooligan's friends join in, and finish the unequal fight. Katya worries for Afonya's safety, and calls the militia - which will only bring Anfonya to the committee's attention again. At a regular work call Borshchov meets Helen  and falls in love at first sight. He starts finding any excuse to work in her flat - even fooling a tenant, astronomer , by swapping his new Finnish sink for an old one, so he can install the Finnish sink in Helen's home as a gift. In his dreams Athos sees a family idyll with his wife Helen and their perfect children. Katya Snegireva, head over heels for Afonya, keeps engineering new meetings with him, and stops at nothing to attract his attention: ""Athanasius! someone called, I thought it was – you ... "". Afonya is completely oblivious to her feelings. Meanwhile Afonya's run in with the militia catches up with him and, for persistent drunkenness, truancy and fighting Afonya is threatened with being sacked at a meeting of the local committee. In addition, if he doesn't restore the Finnish sink he's definitely going to be fired. Afonya takes a porcelain sink with flowers to Helen to swap with the Finnish sink, but meets Helen coming home with company. She makes her feelings quite clear: she has her own life among fashionable and wealthy men, and Afonya is just a plumber. Afonya, depressed, goes to a restaurant with Fedulov and tries to escape into drunkenness, but it doesn't help. In his drunken state he goes to Katya Snegireva's home and proposes marriage, and wakes up next to her in the morning. Katya tells him she's due to move to Africa with work and wonders if she should cancel for Afonya. Afonya then decides to go back to his village, to his aunt Frosya , who brought him up. In the village, he meets his childhood friend Concertina  and, in a joyous moment sends the city a telegram resigning from his job and giving up his apartment. Only then does he learn that Aunt Frosya died two years ago. Afonya's depression increases – he has lost everything and has nowhere to go. Neighbour Uncle Yegor  gives Athos his Aunt Frosya's legacy – savings account in his name, the deeds to her house, and the letters she'd sent to herself, pretending they were from Afonya to the neighbours . The guilt of having ignored her only increases his gloom. Athanasius goes to the post office and tries to call Katya Snegireva on her memorable phone number 50-50-2, or as he says himself, ""rug-rug or two."" The answer comes back - Katya has left. Finally frustrated, he goes to the airport. He does not care where he's going or what will happen to him. Things have gotten so bad that a local militia man has to be convinced Afonya is the man in his passport photograph, so grim has he gotten since it was taken. Finally, just when Athanasius is heading to the AN-2 aircraft , a familiar girlish voice calls out. It's Katya, suitcase in hand: ""Athanasius!, someone called, I thought it was – you ... "

1273501Early in the Second World War, a raiding party of six Nazi sailors, caught ashore when their U-boat is sunk in Hudson Bay, attempt to evade capture by travelling across Canada to the still-neutral United States. The film's title comes from the 49th parallel north which marks part of the border between the two countries. Led by Lieutenants Hirth  and Kuhnecke , the small band of sailors encounter and sometimes brutalize a wide range of people, including the Eskimo Nick , the French-Canadian trapper , the floatplane crew and local Eskimo onlookers, pacifistic German Hutterite farmers, an innocent motorist, and the eccentric English academic and author ([[Leslie Howard . Making their way across Canada first using a stolen seaplane, the five surviving members of the Nazi band try to stir up sympathy among the Hutterite community outside Winnipeg, believing them to be countrymen. Lieutenant Hirth's stirring speech is rejected by Peter , the community's leader, and even by one of their own, Vogel , who comes to the aid of Anna . Vogel is tried by Lieutenant Hirth and summarily executed for the greater crime of trying to break away from the Nazi group. Hijacking an innocent motorist for his automobile, Hirth, Lohrmann and Kranz flee West. With all of Canada searching for them, and having killed 11 civilians along the way, Lohrmann is arrested by Canadian Mounties at a public gathering. Next, Kranz  is knocked out cold by writer Phillip A-Scott  in a cave - despite having been wounded. Finally, the story comes to a head with a confrontation on a freight train between Hirth, the sole remaining fugitive at large, and AWOL Canadian soldier Andy Brock . When Hirth learns the train has crossed into the United States, he surrenders his gun to a customs official and demands to be taken to the German embassy in the U.S. . However, Brock points out that Hirth is locked in the freight hold, but is not listed on the freight manifest, and convinces both American customs officials instead, that the freight car together with Hirth and Brock be sent back to Canada as ""improperly manifested cargo"" - which they readily comply with. The film ends with the train reversing to Canada and Brock about to pummel Hirth in the boxcar.

13379536The book club is the brainchild of fiftysomething six-time divorcée Bernadette, who latches onto the idea when she meets Prudie, a prim, married high school French teacher in her mid-20s, at a Jane Austen film festival. Her concept is to have six members discuss all of Austen's six novels, with each member hosting the group once a month. Also inducted into the club are Sylvia, a fortysomething librarian who recently has separated from her philandering lawyer husband Daniel after more than two decades of marriage; Sylvia's 20-something lesbian daughter Allegra; Jocelyn, a happily unmarried control freak and breeder of Rhodesian Ridgebacks who has been Sylvia's friend since childhood; and Grigg, a science fiction fan who's roped into the group by Jocelyn with the hope he and Sylvia will prove to be a compatible match. As the months pass, each of the members develops characteristics similar to those of Austen's characters and reacts to events in their lives in much the same way their fictional counterparts would. Bernadette is the matriarch figure who longs to see everyone find happiness. Sylvia clings to her belief in steadfast love and devotion, and eventually reconciles with Daniel. Jocelyn denies her own feelings for Grigg while playing matchmaker for him and Sylvia. Prudie, encumbered with her inattentive husband Dean and a free-spirited, pot-smoking, aging-hippie mother, a product of the 1960s counterculture, finds herself desperately trying not to succumb to her feelings for her seductive student Trey. Allegra, who tends to meet her lovers while engaging in death-defying activities, feels betrayed when she discovers her current partner, aspiring writer Corinne, has used Allegra's life as the basis for her short stories. Grigg is attracted to Jocelyn and mystified by her seeming lack of interest in him, marked by her failure to read the Ursula K. Le Guin novels he has hoped will catch her fancy. He also serves as the comedic foil to Jocelyn and Prudie's very serious takes on the books.

1937542Living In Oblivion is divided into three parts, all of which concern the making of a low-budget movie featuring the same director, crew and substantially the same cast. Part one: Director Nick Reve  is shooting a low-budget independent film in the middle of New York City. The catering crew are under-funded and apathetic, deciding not to replace a carton of milk that has been on the craft service table for a week. The scene being shot is a difficult one: a young woman, Ellen, reproaches her elderly mother  for not intervening when the father beat Ellen as a child. However, on the set, just about everything that can go wrong does go wrong: shots are spoiled because of the mic boom is visible; the camera assistant fails to keep the shot in focus; Cora, the actress playing the mother, forgets her lines; and Nicole, the actress playing Ellen, becomes increasingly unfocused and careless. A dispirited Nick calls for a rehearsal without camera to refresh the actors. However, when Nicole  berates herself for acting badly, Cora  reassures her with a gesture that reminds Nicole of a similar gesture made by her own terminally ill mother. Nicole is so upset by the memory that she turns in an unexpectedly passionate performance; and Cora, startled by Nicole's sudden intensity, is equally good. Watching them, Nick becomes enthusiastic all over again. Unfortunately, it was not captured on film; cinematographer and camera operator Wolf , who has been diluting the sub-standard coffee with the spoiled milk, was vomiting in the toilet throughout. Nick ruefully calls for another take. This time, a sudden and insistent beeping sound distracts the actors. Nobody can tell where it's coming from; and Nick flies into a rage, berating everyone on the crew and cast for their inadequacies. He then wakes up in his own bed; the beeping sound was his own alarm clock. He has dreamed the entire segment. It is 4.30am; and he is due on set. Part two: Early the same morning, the film's lead actor Chad Palomino  is getting dressed in Nicole's hotel room. They have spent the night together, and Chad suggests that they might get together again later; Nicole politely declines. Chad and Nicole arrive on the set separately. Nicole's character Ellen and Chad's character Damian have been in love for years but have never admitted it until the scene being shot on this day. Shooting the scene is made practically impossible by Chad's irregular acting. He keeps changing his mind about where to stand and continually moves to places where he is either invisible or badly lit by scenic light. Nicole becomes increasingly frustrated by Chad's egomania; and, when he starts to stroke her head, she briefly loses her cool, then apologizes. An irritated Chad demands a private talk with Nick. He tells Nick that he has slept with Nicole and makes out that it was she, not he, who had wanted to continue the relationship. Desperate to keep Chad happy, Nick agrees that Nicole is not very good. Nicole overhears this conversation on the sound mixer's headphones. Pretending to be contrite, she asks Nick if they can improvise a little; but, when they do so, she announces to everyone that, although she slept with Chad, she is not at all interested in him. Chad loses his temper and quits the movie. Relieved that he will no longer have to please Chad, Nick calls him a ""Hostess Twinkie motherfucker"" and a fight breaks out. Nick beats Chad senseless and fires him. He apologises to Nicole and confesses that he loves her. They kiss—then Nicole abruptly wakes up, still in her bed, having dreamed the whole thing. Part three: Later the same day, the crew is setting up for a dream sequence in which Nicole, as Ellen, stands still while a dwarf walks around her holding an apple. Nick claims to have learned a lesson from his own dream: That sometimes, ""you just got to roll with things."" Nicole admits that she had a dream with Nick in it but doesn't tell him what happened. Nick manages to keep up his positive attitude despite the various mishaps that occur: The smoke machine fails to work, then it catches fire, then his senile mother Cora arrives on the set. However, the ill-tempered dwarf actor Tito  complains that the dream sequence is a cliché  and walks off the set in disgust. Nick's confidence collapses, and he announces that the movie is over. At that moment, his mother intervenes, grabbing the apple, moving to Tito's mark and announcing that she is ""ready"". The crew scrambles to shoot the scene, and her manic performance injects fresh energy and conviction into it. Nick is delighted and decides to keep the new dream sequence, and there is a tense moment while the sound mixer records 30 seconds of room tone. The entire cast and crew manages to remain silent, and they go on to shooting the next sequence.

His colleague Tammy  knocks on the toilet door to hurry him up and as they walk to the car she instructs him on the art of the 'death-knock': knocking on the doors of the recently bereaved to obtain quotes and pictures of the deceased for the newspaper. Niall's poor track record has put his job on the line and Tammy has been detailed to improve his hit-rate. When they reach the house of Mrs Wright, who has lost her son in a car accident, Niall goes in first while Tammy waits outside. Before Niall can introduce himself and launch into his spiel that Tammy has prepared for him, Mrs Wright  interrupts him - ""I know who you are"" - and ushers him into the house. There she ropes him into unstacking the dishwasher as Niall tries in vain to broach the subject of the bereavement against the sound of a fire alarm which has been set off by the cigarette Mrs Wright is smoking. Mrs Wright appears baffled by Niall's requests for pictures and instead offers him some soup telling him they will look at some pictures ""in the morning"", much to Niall's surprise. She then leads him upstairs to the bedroom and encourages him to get some rest. Trapped in the bedroom, Niall examines the dead boy's belongings and finds himself playing with his toys. Meanwhile, Tammy waits outside taking a phone call from her boss at the newspaper, to whom she explains that Niall ""is still in there, so he must be doing alright"". Whilst playing with a light sabre, Niall knocks off a shelf-load of items and as he picks them up, he finds a photo of the dead boy. Mrs Wright, alerted by the noise, appears behind him and embracing Niall, she tells him: ""it's been a long day: time for bed."" Tammy knocks at the door and attempts to talk to Mrs Wright about the accident in which her son was killed, but Mrs Wright replies that her son is in his room and that there must be some mistake. Closing the door, she is nonetheless shaken by Tammy's insistence that her son is dead and she climbs the stairs to the bedroom where she finds Niall tucked up fast asleep in her son's bed. She kisses him on the cheek and switches out the light.

20841547Somewhere in Beverly Hills, in the house of Jack Benny , a mouse version of Jack is practicing his violin---off key---and saying to himself, ""Who is this guy Isaac Stern?""  Outside Jack's mouse hole, a cat is lying in wait, wearing ear muffs to filter out the discordant sound of Jack's violin. Jack calls his servant, Rochester  to get his white suit, which Rochester is wearing at the time. Jack tells the valet that his rental period is up  and he needs the suit because he is taking Mary Livingstone out for her birthday, and, true to character, is looking for a good cheap restaurant. While waiting for Mary, Jack decides to count his cheese in a basement vault. Using a coin on a string, he opens the lock, which appears to be a coin-operated lock from a pay toilet. As soon as he walks through the door, he takes a cane from a nail on the wall and starts humming We're in the Money. When he reaches the bottom of the stairs, he reaches through a hole and trips a razor blade hanging above the passageway like a guillotine. He then comes up to a derringer and uses the cane to trip the trigger on the derringer. Finally, he comes up to another hole, reaches through with the cane and trips a mousetrap. He then reaches the vault door, opens a combination lock, pulls the door open and numerous sound effects including various alarms, a foghorn and machine gun noises are heard. Ed, the vault guard, asks ""who goes there?"", and then an exchange is heard where Ed, apparently having been in the vault for a long time, asks ""did we win the war yet?"" When Benny assures Ed that the war had been won, thinking that Ed was referring to World War II, Ed says: ""That's good. What do you think we'll do with the Kaiser?"" Mary arrives while Jack is inspecting his cheese vault, and he emerges wondering who has been pilfering his gorgonzola. A fat rodent version of Don Wilson attempts to deliver a commercial when Jack advises him that this is a movie and not a television program. When Mary suggests a place, Jack's eyes ring up like an old cash register with a dollar sign  and ""no sale"", they discuss other options. As they were discussing the options, the cat writes a message extolling the ""Kit Kat Club""  and sends it to Jack as a paper airplane. Jack and Mary putter off in his Maxwell with Rochester behind the wheel until they reach the Kit Kat Club by following the arrows pointing to it. While enroute, Mary asks for champagne, while Jack says that he prefers a good ""mousecatel"". Unbeknownst to them, the ""club"" is actually the maw of a real cat, and as they enter, the cat's mouth closes on them. Jack cries: ""Help! Help!"" as the camera cuts to the live-action Jack Benny, who wakes up and, breaking the fourth wall, tells the audience: ""Gosh, what a crazy dream! Imagine- Mary and me as two little mice trapped inside a cat's mouth! And me playing the violin!"" At that point, Jack is interrupted by the sound of a discordant ""Rock-a-Bye Baby"" played on the violin, coming from within Jack's live-action cat. From there, the rodent versions of Jack and Mary emerge unharmed from the live-action cat. Following one last bit of animation , the real Jack Benny does one of his famous ""takes"" as the cartoon fades out.

Later, while stopped at a gas station, the truck's driver, Earl, exchanges hostile words with Jeff before the couple resume their journey. Shortly afterwards, their Jeep breaks down in the middle of the desert. Leaving Jeff with the car, Amy accepts a ride from a passing big-rig trucker named Red Barr driving a Peterbilt 385, to get to a nearby diner and call for help.

Jeff then goes to a police station where he is advised by a deputy to go back to the diner and wait for his wife. There Jeff meets with a simpleton mechanic named Billy, who says he saw Amy arrive in one truck and leave in another. He tells Jeff where they have taken her, but refuses to speak with the police, thinking that they are involved. Jeff heads to the location Billy mentioned, but is ambushed on a back road by Earl, and escapes by driving his Jeep into a river. Abandoning the Jeep and later circling back to watch his attackers salvage the Jeep from the water, Jeff is discovered and knocked out by Billy, an accomplice who had feigned mental impairment earlier. Jeff awakens in a car trunk surrounded by Earl, Billy, another accomplice, Al, a tow-truck driver, and their leader, Red Barr. Red tells Jeff that his wife will be released in exchange for $90,000 that the kidnappers think Jeff has in his bank account. Knowing that he only has a small fraction of the assumed amount, Jeff enters a nearby bank to withdraw what little money he has. After a failed attempt to alert the bank manager to his danger, Jeff steals marked money ribbons and a letter opener from the manager's desk; Jeff uses money ribbons to packet $1 bills in-between two $100 bills, fooling the kidnappers. With the ransom now in hand, Jeff is then instructed by phone to leave town, where he is picked up and bound with duct tape by Earl in his pickup truck. While gloating about how easy Jeff and his wife were to abduct by rigging their car to break down after leaving the gas station, as well as bragging that he intends to kill Jeff and his wife anyway, Earl discovers Jeff's ruse with the ransom. At exactly the same moment, Jeff frees himself and stabs Earl in the chest with the letter opener. After a struggle in the speeding, swerving pickup, Jeff takes over the vehicle, bounds Earl, and forces him to reveal his rendezvous with Red at a local truck stop. Sheriff Boyd appears in his patrol car and, seeing the swerving pickup, calls for backup and stops the vehicle. After Jeff exits the truck with Earl's pistol in hand, a stressed Boyd mistakes the situation and forces Jeff at gunpoint down onto the road. Earl frees himself and shoots Boyd with another pistol concealed in his boot. Just as Earl is about to shoot Jeff, a wounded Boyd shoots and kills Earl. Jeff uses Boyd's radio to call for an ambulance and heads to the truck stop Earl mentioned. At the rest stop, Jeff avoids the police looking for him in connection to the shooting of Boyd, and then spots Red talking on a payphone with another accomplice. Jeff follows Red to his truck where he jumps under the moving truck as Red drives away. Jeff loses his pistol while climbing aboard, but stows away to Red's farm at which he arrives early the next morning. Hiding in a barn, Jeff watches as Red and his remaining accomplices take a bound and gagged Amy and lock her in a freezer in the barn's cellar, leaving her to die. Unable to open the locked cellar door, Jeff finds a gun in Red's truck and uses it to hold Red, his accomplices, and his wife and son at gunpoint, demands the cellar key. Billy escapes, but Jeff forces the rest of the group to safely release Amy from the freezer before locking them in the cellar. Jeff and Amy then flee in a stolen Chevrolet C-20 pickup, while Billy frees Red and Al. They pursue the Taylors in their respective vehicles. During the climactic chase, Billy is killed in a fiery crash when Jeff forces his car off the road, while the trailer from Red's truck detaches, causing Al to violently crash into it. Undeterred, Red attempts to ram Jeff's vehicle off a bridge, trapping Amy's leg underneath the dashboard. Red's big rig nearly falls off the edge and becomes suspended by a steel bridge support. Jeff battles Red on the suspended big rig, eventually hurling Red to the rocks below. Jeff frees Amy from the dashboard in which she  pulls the automatic shift on their pickup, causing the semi to fall on Red and crush him. Sitting on the edge of the bridge beside their mangled pickup truck, Jeff and Amy embrace each other.

12064359 The film is presented as found footage from a personal video camera recovered by the United States Department of Defense. A disclaimer text states that the footage is of a case designated ""Cloverfield"" and was found in the area ""formerly known as Central Park"". The video consists chiefly of segments taped the night of Friday, May 22, 2009. The newer segments were taped over older video that is shown occasionally. The first video segment opens when Rob wakes up on the morning of Monday, April 27 having slept with Beth, a previously platonic friend. They make plans to go to Coney Island that day. The footage cuts to May 22, when Rob's brother Jason and his girlfriend Lily prepare a farewell party for Rob who will be moving to Japan. Their friend Hud uses the camera to film testimonials. After Beth leaves the party, an apparent earthquake strikes, and the city suffers a brief power outage. The local news reports that an oil tanker has capsized near Liberty Island. When the party-goers leave the building, they see the head of the Statue of Liberty crash into the street with several stunning scratch and bite marks. Hud records what appears to be a hand of a large creature several blocks away. The monster causes the Woolworth Building to collapse. Later, during the evacuation of the city, a gigantic tail destroys the Brooklyn Bridge, also killing Jason. News reports show the Army National Guard's 42nd Infantry Division attacking the monster and smaller ""parasite"" creatures falling off its body and attacking people.The creatures are called HSP or ""Human Scale Parasites"" in the Blu-ray special investigation mode. Rob listens to a phone message from Beth saying she is trapped in her apartment and unable to move. Going against the crowd, Rob, Hud, Lily, and Marlena  venture to Midtown Manhattan to rescue Beth. They are attacked by several of the ""parasite"" creatures; Marlena is bitten by one of them. They come across a command center and field hospital, where Marlena dies. One of the military leaders tells the group when the last evacuation helicopter will depart before the military executes its ""Hammer Down Protocol"", which will destroy Manhattan. The group rescues Beth, who was impaled on a piece of rebar. The four make their way to the evacuation site, where they encounter the monster once more over Grand Central Terminal. Lily is raced into one departing Marine Corps helicopter. Moments later, Rob, Beth and Hud are taken away in a second helicopter and witness a U.S. Air Force B-2 Spirit bomb the monster. The monster falls, then lunges at the helicopter, causing it to crash into Central Park.  The film skips to less than an hour later, with a voice on the crashed helicopter's radio warning that the Hammer Down protocol will begin in 15 minutes. The three friends regain consciousness and flee the helicopter. As they leave, the monster kills Hud. Rob and Beth grab the camera and take shelter under Greyshot Arch in Central Park as air raid sirens begin to blare and bombing starts. Rob and Beth take turns leaving their last testimonies of the day, which Rob mentions as Saturday, May 23. The bridge crumbles and debris covers the camera.According to the ""military intelligence"" in the special investigation mode of the Blu-ray version, this was the only thing that protected the camera during the Hammer Down protocol The film then cuts to the footage of Rob and Beth's Coney Island date on April 27. In the distance, unnoticed by Rob and Beth, a large object falls into the ocean.

384990Ann  lives in Baton Rouge. She is unhappily married to John  and has never experienced an orgasm. She is seeing a counselor for her problems. Graham Dalton  is an old college friend of John's. He is now a seeming drifter who, after nine years, returns to live in Baton Rouge. Graham arrives to find Ann, who has no idea that John has invited Graham to stay with them until he finds an apartment. When John arrives home, Graham's demeanor becomes remarkably more guarded, due in large part to John's overt disapproval of Graham's bohemian persona. They also discuss the fact that Graham's college girlfriend, Elizabeth, is also living in Baton Rouge. John is sleeping with Ann's sister, Cynthia , a free-spirited bartender. He rationalizes it by blaming Ann's frigidity. He frequently leaves his law office mid-day to meet with Cynthia, instructing his secretary to reschedule clients who are already in the lobby waiting to see him. Ann makes an impromptu visit to Graham's apartment, where she notices stacks of camcorder tapes around the television. When pressed, Graham explains that he interviews women about their sexual experiences and fantasies, on videotape. Ann, overcome with shock and confusion, flees his apartment. Within a day, Cynthia appears at Graham's apartment and introduces herself. Cynthia presses Graham to explain what ""spooked"" Ann the preceding day. Graham explains the videotapes, and admits to Cynthia his sexual dysfunction: that he is impotent when in the presence of another person, and that he achieves gratification by watching these videos in private. Graham propositions Cynthia to make a tape, assuring her that no other person is allowed to see the tapes. She believes him, and agrees. Cynthia reports back to Ann, who is horrified. Cynthia also tells John. When Ann discovers Cynthia's pearl earring in her bedroom, she is furious. She heads over to Graham's apartment with the intention of making a videotape. Graham objects, telling her it is something she would not do in a normal frame of mind. She insists and Graham relents. Afterward, Ann demands a divorce from John. In the ensuing argument, John gleans that Ann has been to Graham's, and that she made a video. He hits Graham and locks him out of the house, then watches Ann's tape. In it, Ann says she has never felt any kind of 'satisfaction' from sex. After Graham asks if she ever thinks of having sex with other men, she admits she has thought of Graham. Ann later turns the camera on Graham. Graham confesses that he is haunted by Elizabeth, and that his motivation in returning to Baton Rouge is a vague notion of reconnecting with her. He explains that he was a pathological liar, which destroyed an otherwise rewarding relationship with Elizabeth. He explains that he has since gone to great lengths to keep people at a distance and avoid relationships. Graham turns off the camera; it is implied that the two have sex. A chastened John joins Graham on the front patio and, with obvious pleasure, confesses to having sex with Elizabeth while she and Graham were a couple. Furious, Graham goes into a rage and destroys all of the tapes, as well as his camera. In the end, John is summoned to his boss's office, where it’s implied that he is about to be fired due to his frequent cancellations of meetings with important clients to have sexual trysts with Cynthia. In the next scene, Ann and Cynthia reconcile at the bar Cynthia tends before Ann returns home and joins Graham on the front porch, as they appear to be a couple.
1430058The film begins with Joe Kavanagh at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, relaying an experience from his past. He states the ritualised greeting: 'My name is Joe and I'm an alcoholic.' He feels that he is not in a position to drink anymore with safety. He tells the group that he copes by praying and states that he is grateful to be at the meeting. He receives a round of applause for his admissions. He goes round to his friend's place, bangs on the door and pretends to be the police. His friends soon realise that they have been tricked. They then travel in Joe's van where they examine stolen sporting merchandise which is of low quality. Joe and his friends stop at another person's house in order to pick up more people. A car cuts off the van. Joe later encounters the driver, whom Joe later describes as being 'the woman who tried to kill us all.' He exits his van and asks the woman if she lost her guide dog. The woman, Sarah, states that she is a health visitor. She wants to see Liam and his child, but Joe explains that Liam has an important football game to attend. The next shot is of the football match. Joe is very encouraging as a coach. The other team appears in white and black, which are the colours that Joe's team wears. Joe's team express their anger at this and respond by taking their shirts off so that they are able to distinguish between players. The other team scores the first goal of the game. Joe drives Liam home and tells Liam to take things one day at a time. Liam abruptly tells Joe to pull over and Liam runs up to a male who acts aggressively towards him. Joe does not hear what transpires between Liam and the man. Later, Joe sees Sarah, who is seen struggling with wallpaper in her car. Joe appears to fancy her, as Sarah tells him her name and he flirts with her. Joe then helps an acquaintance of Sarah's to complete a wall papering and paint job in Sarah's flat. Sarah then leaves the lads to it. She later brings them tea as they paint the ceiling and sing to themselves. They then look outside and notice someone taking photos of them through the window. Joe runs outside with his can of white paint and brush to confront the man who was taking the photos. The photographer tells Joe that he was just doing his job and that he has a bad heart. Joe then paints all over the photographer's car. The car speeds away and manages to knock over a pile of rubbish by the side of the road. Later, Sarah and Joe have dinner together. They are able to make comfortable conversation with one another. There is a bottle of red wine on the table, but Joe does not drink any of the alcohol. Sarah's telephone rings and she leaves the kitchen to answer it. Joe is then left alone with the wine. He clears his plate and appears somewhat nervous. When Sarah finishes with her telephone conversation, Joe asks her about the photographs on her wall. Joe later reveals to Sarah that he does not drink, to which Sarah replies: 'Why didn't you say?' Joe reveals that he is an alcoholic and he has not had a drink in ten months. Joe is happy that Sarah knows and that she has been direct in her responses to him. Joe thanks Sarah for her company. Sarah pays Joe for the work that he completed on her flat and they part company. Joe attends the Mayfield Health Centre. The practice is very busy and the receptionist tries to cope with a patient who is complaining because he has been waiting a long time in order to receive his prescription. Joe tells the receptionist that he would like to see Sarah. The receptionist does not appear to be surprised by his request and says that Joe is free to pop his head around the door. He sees Sarah advising parents on dealing with the changing of nappies. Outside the Health Centre, Joe asks Sarah if she would like to go ten-pin bowling with him and to ring him if she fancies going. They then part company. Sarah speaks with a female colleague, Maggie, and says that Joe seems a bit wild. She states that she is not going to go bowling with Joe. The next shot is of a bowling alley, with 'Spirit in the Sky' playing in the background. Sarah and Joe bowl together and laugh at their many errors. They occupy Aisle 16 and neither of them are spectacular players. They go back to Sarah's place where she asks him in for a cup of tea. Joe politely says no. Sarah offers him money for a taxi. A friendly argument ensues, at the end of which Sarah finds herself locked out of her flat. Sarah says that she can sleep in her car. Joe states that Sarah can sleep at his place, but not necessarily together. They arrive at Joe's and he shows her around his flat. While Joe makes tea for Sarah, she asks him if it is alright to put some music on. She puts on the same piece of music that the audience heard during the opening credits of the film, Beethoven's Violin Concerto in D Major. Joe tells Sarah that he used to be in a band and they won a local talent contest. Joe tells Sarah a story of how he was desperate for a drink one day and what transpired. He went to a music shop and stole some cassettes. He took one of them home and 'got pissed.' He describes the experience as being 'magical.' When Sarah asks him what made him stop drinking, Joe asks her why she wants to know. He is not hostile, but curious. Joe says that he is scared to tell her and that there is a strong chance that she will hate him if he tells. Joe explains that there was a girl he used to drink with and they loved one another. They were both 'just tangled up' and they used to get into terrible arguments and tear one another apart. The audience then sees a flashback where Joe and the girl are returning home from a night out. He states that 'a cloud just descended... really, really dark. And suddenly I hated her. I hated me.' He describes how he tried to open the door, but was unable to; when the partner whom he was with laughed at him, Joe lost control because she found it funny. He beat her by punching and kicking her, while she lay helpless on the ground. He screamed abuse at her. The next day, he had a blackout. Now, he remembers every punch and kick. He states how ashamed and disgusted he is with himself. He is obviously contrite and he has not yet forgiven himself for his actions. In the next shot, Sarah comforts Joe and tells him that it is okay. The next scene is of a football match. Joe sees three men beating up Liam. Joe attempts to intervene. He helps Liam up and asks him if he is still clean. Liam states that he is. Liam confronts his wife when she comes home. He suspects that she has been using and asks her if she 'takes him for a prick.' Liam then yells that he will leave her to rot, grabs her by her neck and forces her to look at herself in the mirror. Joe then attends Liam's flat and encounters Liam's wife shooting up in the bathroom. An argument erupts between them. Joe offers to help her. She does not want the kind of help that Joe offers. Joe then reluctantly assists her to tie off one of her veins so that she can shoot up. Joe tries to make sense of her incoherent mumbles as she lies prostrate in the bathtub. Joe then goes to a snooker club where he asks after Liam's whereabouts. Joe tells one of the men that he encounters that Liam has a four-year-old boy in an attempt to mitigate matters. Liam says that he does not want them to take liberties. He comes across Liam and is cross because Liam told him that he had stopped dealing. A tearful Liam confesses that he still owes money. Joe also tells Liam that he suspects that his wife is on the game. He is worried that people are going to break his legs. Joe and Sarah prepare a meal together, which is interrupted when they have sex. The next day, Joe goes to Stella Maris' B & B in order to deal with the matter of Liam. In a later scene, Joe gives Sarah a pair of earrings, as well as a ring. Joe tells Sarah that he loves her. Sarah tells him that she does not want it and Joe cannot understand what he has done wrong. Joe is confused as to why Sarah has behaved in this fashion. In the next shot, we see a copy of the Alcoholics Anonymous' small blue Bible as Joe listens to Beethoven's Violin Concerto in D Major and makes notes in a book. When Sarah arrives at his door, she apologises. They drink tea together and later embrace. Joe drives his van and his mates direct him to a place where they rob another van. At the outset, Joe does not know where they are going. Joe is shocked with his unwitting role in the robbery of Astral Sports. He still acts as the get-away driver. At the next football match, Joe cleverly remarks that the other team look like budgies because of their blue and yellow striped uniforms. Meanwhile, Sarah reveals to her co-worker Maggie that she is pregnant. Maggie congratulates her. At Sarah's flat, she expresses her reservations about Joe's dealings with Liam. Joe tells her that there are some things that she does not need to know. Joe outlines the limited choices that Liam faces, most of which are not pleasant. Sarah accuses Joe of being a drug dealer and asks where he got the money for her earrings and ring. Joe replies that the gang gave him some money. Sarah becomes enraged and asks, 'Are you going to hit me too, Joe?' Joe attends Liam's flat and states that Liam must deal with things himself. Joe returns to his flat with bottles of Smirnoff Vodka. He pours himself a drink, and takes a sip. Liam then goes to Joe's flat, where Joe is very inebriated. Joe does not understand why Liam has come to see him. Joe calls Liam a 'stupid wee prick.' The alcohol has overtaken Joe and he is hostile to Liam, who needs his help. As Liam witnesses members of the gang coming towards the premises, Liam realises that Joe has passed out and he kisses Joe on his forehead. Joe suddenly snaps awake and realises that Liam has taken his own life by hanging himself. The film concludes with Liam's funeral.
6189444Unlucky plumber – Athanasius Borshchov   and his friend Fedulov  spend all day and night avoiding work and finding opportunities to drink. Afonya takes ""kickbacks"" from clients and is often in trouble with the local committee for his behaviour. Afonya meets plasterer Kolya  in a pub, gets drunk and comes home. When his girlfriend sees the state he's in, she leaves him. The next morning he can't even remember yesterday's drinking companion. Things continue to go downhill for Afonya. When student interns from the vocational school are allocated to the plumbers, master ZHEK Vostryakovo  doesn't allocate any to him, fearing that he will not teach them well. Afonya begs for trainees and gets two. Having worked with him for one day and having seen his attitude and working methods, the trainees refuse to work with him anymore. The next day, Kolya arrives to live at Afonya's, having been thrown out of his house by his wife. At a dance Afonya meets young nurse Katya Snegireva , who knows about him through her brother, who used to play in Afonya's volleyball team. Afonya doesn't pay her much attention, because he's more interested in older women and already has his eye on one at the dance. However, a romantic walk with the older woman after the dance is over before it begins – Afonya is challenged to a fight by a hooligan, who he'd quarrelled with at the dance. The hooligan's friends join in, and finish the unequal fight. Katya worries for Afonya's safety, and calls the militia - which will only bring Anfonya to the committee's attention again. At a regular work call Borshchov meets Helen  and falls in love at first sight. He starts finding any excuse to work in her flat - even fooling a tenant, astronomer , by swapping his new Finnish sink for an old one, so he can install the Finnish sink in Helen's home as a gift. In his dreams Athos sees a family idyll with his wife Helen and their perfect children. Katya Snegireva, head over heels for Afonya, keeps engineering new meetings with him, and stops at nothing to attract his attention: ""Athanasius! someone called, I thought it was – you ... "". Afonya is completely oblivious to her feelings. Meanwhile Afonya's run in with the militia catches up with him and, for persistent drunkenness, truancy and fighting Afonya is threatened with being sacked at a meeting of the local committee. In addition, if he doesn't restore the Finnish sink he's definitely going to be fired. Afonya takes a porcelain sink with flowers to Helen to swap with the Finnish sink, but meets Helen coming home with company. She makes her feelings quite clear: she has her own life among fashionable and wealthy men, and Afonya is just a plumber. Afonya, depressed, goes to a restaurant with Fedulov and tries to escape into drunkenness, but it doesn't help. In his drunken state he goes to Katya Snegireva's home and proposes marriage, and wakes up next to her in the morning. Katya tells him she's due to move to Africa with work and wonders if she should cancel for Afonya. Afonya then decides to go back to his village, to his aunt Frosya , who brought him up. In the village, he meets his childhood friend Concertina  and, in a joyous moment sends the city a telegram resigning from his job and giving up his apartment. Only then does he learn that Aunt Frosya died two years ago. Afonya's depression increases – he has lost everything and has nowhere to go. Neighbour Uncle Yegor  gives Athos his Aunt Frosya's legacy – savings account in his name, the deeds to her house, and the letters she'd sent to herself, pretending they were from Afonya to the neighbours . The guilt of having ignored her only increases his gloom. Athanasius goes to the post office and tries to call Katya Snegireva on her memorable phone number 50-50-2, or as he says himself, ""rug-rug or two."" The answer comes back - Katya has left. Finally frustrated, he goes to the airport. He does not care where he's going or what will happen to him. Things have gotten so bad that a local militia man has to be convinced Afonya is the man in his passport photograph, so grim has he gotten since it was taken. Finally, just when Athanasius is heading to the AN-2 aircraft , a familiar girlish voice calls out. It's Katya, suitcase in hand: ""Athanasius!, someone called, I thought it was – you ... "

1273501Early in the Second World War, a raiding party of six Nazi sailors, caught ashore when their U-boat is sunk in Hudson Bay, attempt to evade capture by travelling across Canada to the still-neutral United States. The film's title comes from the 49th parallel north which marks part of the border between the two countries. Led by Lieutenants Hirth  and Kuhnecke , the small band of sailors encounter and sometimes brutalize a wide range of people, including the Eskimo Nick , the French-Canadian trapper , the floatplane crew and local Eskimo onlookers, pacifistic German Hutterite farmers, an innocent motorist, and the eccentric English academic and author ([[Leslie Howard . Making their way across Canada first using a stolen seaplane, the five surviving members of the Nazi band try to stir up sympathy among the Hutterite community outside Winnipeg, believing them to be countrymen. Lieutenant Hirth's stirring speech is rejected by Peter , the community's leader, and even by one of their own, Vogel , who comes to the aid of Anna . Vogel is tried by Lieutenant Hirth and summarily executed for the greater crime of trying to break away from the Nazi group. Hijacking an innocent motorist for his automobile, Hirth, Lohrmann and Kranz flee West. With all of Canada searching for them, and having killed 11 civilians along the way, Lohrmann is arrested by Canadian Mounties at a public gathering. Next, Kranz  is knocked out cold by writer Phillip A-Scott  in a cave - despite having been wounded. Finally, the story comes to a head with a confrontation on a freight train between Hirth, the sole remaining fugitive at large, and AWOL Canadian soldier Andy Brock . When Hirth learns the train has crossed into the United States, he surrenders his gun to a customs official and demands to be taken to the German embassy in the U.S. . However, Brock points out that Hirth is locked in the freight hold, but is not listed on the freight manifest, and convinces both American customs officials instead, that the freight car together with Hirth and Brock be sent back to Canada as ""improperly manifested cargo"" - which they readily comply with. The film ends with the train reversing to Canada and Brock about to pummel Hirth in the boxcar.

13379536The book club is the brainchild of fiftysomething six-time divorcée Bernadette, who latches onto the idea when she meets Prudie, a prim, married high school French teacher in her mid-20s, at a Jane Austen film festival. Her concept is to have six members discuss all of Austen's six novels, with each member hosting the group once a month. Also inducted into the club are Sylvia, a fortysomething librarian who recently has separated from her philandering lawyer husband Daniel after more than two decades of marriage; Sylvia's 20-something lesbian daughter Allegra; Jocelyn, a happily unmarried control freak and breeder of Rhodesian Ridgebacks who has been Sylvia's friend since childhood; and Grigg, a science fiction fan who's roped into the group by Jocelyn with the hope he and Sylvia will prove to be a compatible match. As the months pass, each of the members develops characteristics similar to those of Austen's characters and reacts to events in their lives in much the same way their fictional counterparts would. Bernadette is the matriarch figure who longs to see everyone find happiness. Sylvia clings to her belief in steadfast love and devotion, and eventually reconciles with Daniel. Jocelyn denies her own feelings for Grigg while playing matchmaker for him and Sylvia. Prudie, encumbered with her inattentive husband Dean and a free-spirited, pot-smoking, aging-hippie mother, a product of the 1960s counterculture, finds herself desperately trying not to succumb to her feelings for her seductive student Trey. Allegra, who tends to meet her lovers while engaging in death-defying activities, feels betrayed when she discovers her current partner, aspiring writer Corinne, has used Allegra's life as the basis for her short stories. Grigg is attracted to Jocelyn and mystified by her seeming lack of interest in him, marked by her failure to read the Ursula K. Le Guin novels he has hoped will catch her fancy. He also serves as the comedic foil to Jocelyn and Prudie's very serious takes on the books.

When one asks, ""And where is El Khobar?"", MacRae, as the professor, enters carrying El Khobar's clothes, and quietly announces ""El Khobar is dead"". Margot is grief-stricken, but Birabeau, suspecting the truth, mischievously says that they can all be grateful to ""the ghost of El Khobar"", winking as he says this. As soon as they are alone, MacRae begins to sing the song One Alone to Margot, making her realize that her boring Latin tutor and the dashing El Khobar are one and the same. She rushes into his arms.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stidFull%20Synopsis One song not by Romberg, Gay Parisienne, written for the 1943 film version of the show, is retained for this film.
1937542Living In Oblivion is divided into three parts, all of which concern the making of a low-budget movie featuring the same director, crew and substantially the same cast. Part one: Director Nick Reve  is shooting a low-budget independent film in the middle of New York City. The catering crew are under-funded and apathetic, deciding not to replace a carton of milk that has been on the craft service table for a week. The scene being shot is a difficult one: a young woman, Ellen, reproaches her elderly mother  for not intervening when the father beat Ellen as a child. However, on the set, just about everything that can go wrong does go wrong: shots are spoiled because of the mic boom is visible; the camera assistant fails to keep the shot in focus; Cora, the actress playing the mother, forgets her lines; and Nicole, the actress playing Ellen, becomes increasingly unfocused and careless. A dispirited Nick calls for a rehearsal without camera to refresh the actors. However, when Nicole  berates herself for acting badly, Cora  reassures her with a gesture that reminds Nicole of a similar gesture made by her own terminally ill mother. Nicole is so upset by the memory that she turns in an unexpectedly passionate performance; and Cora, startled by Nicole's sudden intensity, is equally good. Watching them, Nick becomes enthusiastic all over again. Unfortunately, it was not captured on film; cinematographer and camera operator Wolf , who has been diluting the sub-standard coffee with the spoiled milk, was vomiting in the toilet throughout. Nick ruefully calls for another take. This time, a sudden and insistent beeping sound distracts the actors. Nobody can tell where it's coming from; and Nick flies into a rage, berating everyone on the crew and cast for their inadequacies. He then wakes up in his own bed; the beeping sound was his own alarm clock. He has dreamed the entire segment. It is 4.30am; and he is due on set. Part two: Early the same morning, the film's lead actor Chad Palomino  is getting dressed in Nicole's hotel room. They have spent the night together, and Chad suggests that they might get together again later; Nicole politely declines. Chad and Nicole arrive on the set separately. Nicole's character Ellen and Chad's character Damian have been in love for years but have never admitted it until the scene being shot on this day. Shooting the scene is made practically impossible by Chad's irregular acting. He keeps changing his mind about where to stand and continually moves to places where he is either invisible or badly lit by scenic light. Nicole becomes increasingly frustrated by Chad's egomania; and, when he starts to stroke her head, she briefly loses her cool, then apologizes. An irritated Chad demands a private talk with Nick. He tells Nick that he has slept with Nicole and makes out that it was she, not he, who had wanted to continue the relationship. Desperate to keep Chad happy, Nick agrees that Nicole is not very good. Nicole overhears this conversation on the sound mixer's headphones. Pretending to be contrite, she asks Nick if they can improvise a little; but, when they do so, she announces to everyone that, although she slept with Chad, she is not at all interested in him. Chad loses his temper and quits the movie. Relieved that he will no longer have to please Chad, Nick calls him a ""Hostess Twinkie motherfucker"" and a fight breaks out. Nick beats Chad senseless and fires him. He apologises to Nicole and confesses that he loves her. They kiss—then Nicole abruptly wakes up, still in her bed, having dreamed the whole thing. Part three: Later the same day, the crew is setting up for a dream sequence in which Nicole, as Ellen, stands still while a dwarf walks around her holding an apple. Nick claims to have learned a lesson from his own dream: That sometimes, ""you just got to roll with things."" Nicole admits that she had a dream with Nick in it but doesn't tell him what happened. Nick manages to keep up his positive attitude despite the various mishaps that occur: The smoke machine fails to work, then it catches fire, then his senile mother Cora arrives on the set. However, the ill-tempered dwarf actor Tito  complains that the dream sequence is a cliché  and walks off the set in disgust. Nick's confidence collapses, and he announces that the movie is over. At that moment, his mother intervenes, grabbing the apple, moving to Tito's mark and announcing that she is ""ready"". The crew scrambles to shoot the scene, and her manic performance injects fresh energy and conviction into it. Nick is delighted and decides to keep the new dream sequence, and there is a tense moment while the sound mixer records 30 seconds of room tone. The entire cast and crew manages to remain silent, and they go on to shooting the next sequence.
31555231In flashback, Niall , a local news reporter, recalls visiting his mother's grave, as he smartens up in a toilet mirror. His colleague Tammy  knocks on the toilet door to hurry him up and as they walk to the car she instructs him on the art of the 'death-knock': knocking on the doors of the recently bereaved to obtain quotes and pictures of the deceased for the newspaper. Niall's poor track record has put his job on the line and Tammy has been detailed to improve his hit-rate. When they reach the house of Mrs Wright, who has lost her son in a car accident, Niall goes in first while Tammy waits outside. Before Niall can introduce himself and launch into his spiel that Tammy has prepared for him, Mrs Wright  interrupts him - ""I know who you are"" - and ushers him into the house. There she ropes him into unstacking the dishwasher as Niall tries in vain to broach the subject of the bereavement against the sound of a fire alarm which has been set off by the cigarette Mrs Wright is smoking. Mrs Wright appears baffled by Niall's requests for pictures and instead offers him some soup telling him they will look at some pictures ""in the morning"", much to Niall's surprise. She then leads him upstairs to the bedroom and encourages him to get some rest. Trapped in the bedroom, Niall examines the dead boy's belongings and finds himself playing with his toys. Meanwhile, Tammy waits outside taking a phone call from her boss at the newspaper, to whom she explains that Niall ""is still in there, so he must be doing alright"". Whilst playing with a light sabre, Niall knocks off a shelf-load of items and as he picks them up, he finds a photo of the dead boy. Mrs Wright, alerted by the noise, appears behind him and embracing Niall, she tells him: ""it's been a long day: time for bed."" Tammy knocks at the door and attempts to talk to Mrs Wright about the accident in which her son was killed, but Mrs Wright replies that her son is in his room and that there must be some mistake. Closing the door, she is nonetheless shaken by Tammy's insistence that her son is dead and she climbs the stairs to the bedroom where she finds Niall tucked up fast asleep in her son's bed. She kisses him on the cheek and switches out the light.
384141The story revolves around a farmer Shambu Mahato , who lives with his wife Parvati `Paro’  and son Kanhaiya  in a small village that has been hit badly by a famine. After years of drought, the region finally gets rain, leading to the farmers to rejoice. Shambu owns two bighas  of land, which is the only means of livelihood for the whole family. The local zamindar  Thakur Harnam Singh ([[Murad  partners with some city business men to construct a mill on his large parcel of land, which in return would profit them and bring prosperity to the village. The only problem is that in the middle of Harnam singh's land lay Shambu's meager two bighas of land. Harnam Singh is very confident that he could buy Shambu's land. Shambu has borrowed money from Harnam Singh several times in the past and has not paid back his debt.

20841547Somewhere in Beverly Hills, in the house of Jack Benny , a mouse version of Jack is practicing his violin---off key---and saying to himself, ""Who is this guy Isaac Stern?""  Outside Jack's mouse hole, a cat is lying in wait, wearing ear muffs to filter out the discordant sound of Jack's violin. Jack calls his servant, Rochester  to get his white suit, which Rochester is wearing at the time. Jack tells the valet that his rental period is up  and he needs the suit because he is taking Mary Livingstone out for her birthday, and, true to character, is looking for a good cheap restaurant. While waiting for Mary, Jack decides to count his cheese in a basement vault. Using a coin on a string, he opens the lock, which appears to be a coin-operated lock from a pay toilet. As soon as he walks through the door, he takes a cane from a nail on the wall and starts humming We're in the Money. When he reaches the bottom of the stairs, he reaches through a hole and trips a razor blade hanging above the passageway like a guillotine. He then comes up to a derringer and uses the cane to trip the trigger on the derringer. Finally, he comes up to another hole, reaches through with the cane and trips a mousetrap. He then reaches the vault door, opens a combination lock, pulls the door open and numerous sound effects including various alarms, a foghorn and machine gun noises are heard. Ed, the vault guard, asks ""who goes there?"", and then an exchange is heard where Ed, apparently having been in the vault for a long time, asks ""did we win the war yet?"" When Benny assures Ed that the war had been won, thinking that Ed was referring to World War II, Ed says: ""That's good. What do you think we'll do with the Kaiser?"" Mary arrives while Jack is inspecting his cheese vault, and he emerges wondering who has been pilfering his gorgonzola. A fat rodent version of Don Wilson attempts to deliver a commercial when Jack advises him that this is a movie and not a television program. When Mary suggests a place, Jack's eyes ring up like an old cash register with a dollar sign  and ""no sale"", they discuss other options. As they were discussing the options, the cat writes a message extolling the ""Kit Kat Club""  and sends it to Jack as a paper airplane. Jack and Mary putter off in his Maxwell with Rochester behind the wheel until they reach the Kit Kat Club by following the arrows pointing to it. While enroute, Mary asks for champagne, while Jack says that he prefers a good ""mousecatel"". Unbeknownst to them, the ""club"" is actually the maw of a real cat, and as they enter, the cat's mouth closes on them. Jack cries: ""Help! Help!"" as the camera cuts to the live-action Jack Benny, who wakes up and, breaking the fourth wall, tells the audience: ""Gosh, what a crazy dream! Imagine- Mary and me as two little mice trapped inside a cat's mouth! And me playing the violin!"" At that point, Jack is interrupted by the sound of a discordant ""Rock-a-Bye Baby"" played on the violin, coming from within Jack's live-action cat. From there, the rodent versions of Jack and Mary emerge unharmed from the live-action cat. Following one last bit of animation , the real Jack Benny does one of his famous ""takes"" as the cartoon fades out.
1730420While driving cross-country from Boston to San Diego in their new Jeep Grand Cherokee, Jeff Taylor and his wife Amy narrowly miss colliding with a beat-up Ford F-150 that darts in front of them from an connecting road on a deserted highway. Later, while stopped at a gas station, the truck's driver, Earl, exchanges hostile words with Jeff before the couple resume their journey. Shortly afterwards, their Jeep breaks down in the middle of the desert. Leaving Jeff with the car, Amy accepts a ride from a passing big-rig trucker named Red Barr driving a Peterbilt 385, to get to a nearby diner and call for help. Jeff eventually discovers that the Jeep's battery connections have been suspiciously tampered with, and, after reconnecting them, drives to the diner, only to find that no one has seen his wife. When he catches up with Barr on the road and forces him to stop, the trucker claims he has never seen Jeff or his wife before. Jeff hails a passing sheriff, named Boyd, but a brief search of Barr's truck yields no sign of Amy, and he is let go. Jeff then goes to a police station where he is advised by a deputy to go back to the diner and wait for his wife. There Jeff meets with a simpleton mechanic named Billy, who says he saw Amy arrive in one truck and leave in another. He tells Jeff where they have taken her, but refuses to speak with the police, thinking that they are involved. Jeff heads to the location Billy mentioned, but is ambushed on a back road by Earl, and escapes by driving his Jeep into a river. Abandoning the Jeep and later circling back to watch his attackers salvage the Jeep from the water, Jeff is discovered and knocked out by Billy, an accomplice who had feigned mental impairment earlier. Jeff awakens in a car trunk surrounded by Earl, Billy, another accomplice, Al, a tow-truck driver, and their leader, Red Barr. Red tells Jeff that his wife will be released in exchange for $90,000 that the kidnappers think Jeff has in his bank account. Knowing that he only has a small fraction of the assumed amount, Jeff enters a nearby bank to withdraw what little money he has. After a failed attempt to alert the bank manager to his danger, Jeff steals marked money ribbons and a letter opener from the manager's desk; Jeff uses money ribbons to packet $1 bills in-between two $100 bills, fooling the kidnappers. With the ransom now in hand, Jeff is then instructed by phone to leave town, where he is picked up and bound with duct tape by Earl in his pickup truck. While gloating about how easy Jeff and his wife were to abduct by rigging their car to break down after leaving the gas station, as well as bragging that he intends to kill Jeff and his wife anyway, Earl discovers Jeff's ruse with the ransom. At exactly the same moment, Jeff frees himself and stabs Earl in the chest with the letter opener. After a struggle in the speeding, swerving pickup, Jeff takes over the vehicle, bounds Earl, and forces him to reveal his rendezvous with Red at a local truck stop. Sheriff Boyd appears in his patrol car and, seeing the swerving pickup, calls for backup and stops the vehicle. After Jeff exits the truck with Earl's pistol in hand, a stressed Boyd mistakes the situation and forces Jeff at gunpoint down onto the road. Earl frees himself and shoots Boyd with another pistol concealed in his boot. Just as Earl is about to shoot Jeff, a wounded Boyd shoots and kills Earl. Jeff uses Boyd's radio to call for an ambulance and heads to the truck stop Earl mentioned. At the rest stop, Jeff avoids the police looking for him in connection to the shooting of Boyd, and then spots Red talking on a payphone with another accomplice. Jeff follows Red to his truck where he jumps under the moving truck as Red drives away. Jeff loses his pistol while climbing aboard, but stows away to Red's farm at which he arrives early the next morning. Hiding in a barn, Jeff watches as Red and his remaining accomplices take a bound and gagged Amy and lock her in a freezer in the barn's cellar, leaving her to die. Unable to open the locked cellar door, Jeff finds a gun in Red's truck and uses it to hold Red, his accomplices, and his wife and son at gunpoint, demands the cellar key. Billy escapes, but Jeff forces the rest of the group to safely release Amy from the freezer before locking them in the cellar. Jeff and Amy then flee in a stolen Chevrolet C-20 pickup, while Billy frees Red and Al. They pursue the Taylors in their respective vehicles. During the climactic chase, Billy is killed in a fiery crash when Jeff forces his car off the road, while the trailer from Red's truck detaches, causing Al to violently crash into it. Undeterred, Red attempts to ram Jeff's vehicle off a bridge, trapping Amy's leg underneath the dashboard. Red's big rig nearly falls off the edge and becomes suspended by a steel bridge support. Jeff battles Red on the suspended big rig, eventually hurling Red to the rocks below. Jeff frees Amy from the dashboard in which she  pulls the automatic shift on their pickup, causing the semi to fall on Red and crush him. Sitting on the edge of the bridge beside their mangled pickup truck, Jeff and Amy embrace each other.

The footage cuts to May 22, when Rob's brother Jason and his girlfriend Lily prepare a farewell party for Rob who will be moving to Japan. Their friend Hud uses the camera to film testimonials. After Beth leaves the party, an apparent earthquake strikes, and the city suffers a brief power outage. The local news reports that an oil tanker has capsized near Liberty Island. When the party-goers leave the building, they see the head of the Statue of Liberty crash into the street with several stunning scratch and bite marks. Hud records what appears to be a hand of a large creature several blocks away. The monster causes the Woolworth Building to collapse. Later, during the evacuation of the city, a gigantic tail destroys the Brooklyn Bridge, also killing Jason. News reports show the Army National Guard's 42nd Infantry Division attacking the monster and smaller ""parasite"" creatures falling off its body and attacking people.The creatures are called HSP or ""Human Scale Parasites"" in the Blu-ray special investigation mode. Rob listens to a phone message from Beth saying she is trapped in her apartment and unable to move. Going against the crowd, Rob, Hud, Lily, and Marlena  venture to Midtown Manhattan to rescue Beth. They are attacked by several of the ""parasite"" creatures; Marlena is bitten by one of them. They come across a command center and field hospital, where Marlena dies. One of the military leaders tells the group when the last evacuation helicopter will depart before the military executes its ""Hammer Down Protocol"", which will destroy Manhattan. The group rescues Beth, who was impaled on a piece of rebar. The four make their way to the evacuation site, where they encounter the monster once more over Grand Central Terminal. Lily is raced into one departing Marine Corps helicopter. Moments later, Rob, Beth and Hud are taken away in a second helicopter and witness a U.S. Air Force B-2 Spirit bomb the monster. The monster falls, then lunges at the helicopter, causing it to crash into Central Park.  The film skips to less than an hour later, with a voice on the crashed helicopter's radio warning that the Hammer Down protocol will begin in 15 minutes. The three friends regain consciousness and flee the helicopter. As they leave, the monster kills Hud. Rob and Beth grab the camera and take shelter under Greyshot Arch in Central Park as air raid sirens begin to blare and bombing starts. Rob and Beth take turns leaving their last testimonies of the day, which Rob mentions as Saturday, May 23. The bridge crumbles and debris covers the camera.According to the ""military intelligence"" in the special investigation mode of the Blu-ray version, this was the only thing that protected the camera during the Hammer Down protocol The film then cuts to the footage of Rob and Beth's Coney Island date on April 27. In the distance, unnoticed by Rob and Beth, a large object falls into the ocean.

384990Ann  lives in Baton Rouge. She is unhappily married to John  and has never experienced an orgasm. She is seeing a counselor for her problems. Graham Dalton  is an old college friend of John's. He is now a seeming drifter who, after nine years, returns to live in Baton Rouge. Graham arrives to find Ann, who has no idea that John has invited Graham to stay with them until he finds an apartment. When John arrives home, Graham's demeanor becomes remarkably more guarded, due in large part to John's overt disapproval of Graham's bohemian persona. They also discuss the fact that Graham's college girlfriend, Elizabeth, is also living in Baton Rouge. John is sleeping with Ann's sister, Cynthia , a free-spirited bartender. He rationalizes it by blaming Ann's frigidity. He frequently leaves his law office mid-day to meet with Cynthia, instructing his secretary to reschedule clients who are already in the lobby waiting to see him. Ann makes an impromptu visit to Graham's apartment, where she notices stacks of camcorder tapes around the television. When pressed, Graham explains that he interviews women about their sexual experiences and fantasies, on videotape. Ann, overcome with shock and confusion, flees his apartment. Within a day, Cynthia appears at Graham's apartment and introduces herself. Cynthia presses Graham to explain what ""spooked"" Ann the preceding day. Graham explains the videotapes, and admits to Cynthia his sexual dysfunction: that he is impotent when in the presence of another person, and that he achieves gratification by watching these videos in private. Graham propositions Cynthia to make a tape, assuring her that no other person is allowed to see the tapes. She believes him, and agrees. Cynthia reports back to Ann, who is horrified. Cynthia also tells John. When Ann discovers Cynthia's pearl earring in her bedroom, she is furious. She heads over to Graham's apartment with the intention of making a videotape. Graham objects, telling her it is something she would not do in a normal frame of mind. She insists and Graham relents. Afterward, Ann demands a divorce from John. In the ensuing argument, John gleans that Ann has been to Graham's, and that she made a video. He hits Graham and locks him out of the house, then watches Ann's tape. In it, Ann says she has never felt any kind of 'satisfaction' from sex. After Graham asks if she ever thinks of having sex with other men, she admits she has thought of Graham. Ann later turns the camera on Graham. Graham confesses that he is haunted by Elizabeth, and that his motivation in returning to Baton Rouge is a vague notion of reconnecting with her. He explains that he was a pathological liar, which destroyed an otherwise rewarding relationship with Elizabeth. He explains that he has since gone to great lengths to keep people at a distance and avoid relationships. Graham turns off the camera; it is implied that the two have sex. A chastened John joins Graham on the front patio and, with obvious pleasure, confesses to having sex with Elizabeth while she and Graham were a couple. Furious, Graham goes into a rage and destroys all of the tapes, as well as his camera. In the end, John is summoned to his boss's office, where it’s implied that he is about to be fired due to his frequent cancellations of meetings with important clients to have sexual trysts with Cynthia. In the next scene, Ann and Cynthia reconcile at the bar Cynthia tends before Ann returns home and joins Graham on the front porch, as they appear to be a couple.
1430058The film begins with Joe Kavanagh at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, relaying an experience from his past. He states the ritualised greeting: 'My name is Joe and I'm an alcoholic.' He feels that he is not in a position to drink anymore with safety. He tells the group that he copes by praying and states that he is grateful to be at the meeting. He receives a round of applause for his admissions. He goes round to his friend's place, bangs on the door and pretends to be the police. His friends soon realise that they have been tricked. They then travel in Joe's van where they examine stolen sporting merchandise which is of low quality. Joe and his friends stop at another person's house in order to pick up more people. A car cuts off the van. Joe later encounters the driver, whom Joe later describes as being 'the woman who tried to kill us all.' He exits his van and asks the woman if she lost her guide dog. The woman, Sarah, states that she is a health visitor. She wants to see Liam and his child, but Joe explains that Liam has an important football game to attend. The next shot is of the football match. Joe is very encouraging as a coach. The other team appears in white and black, which are the colours that Joe's team wears. Joe's team express their anger at this and respond by taking their shirts off so that they are able to distinguish between players. The other team scores the first goal of the game. Joe drives Liam home and tells Liam to take things one day at a time. Liam abruptly tells Joe to pull over and Liam runs up to a male who acts aggressively towards him. Joe does not hear what transpires between Liam and the man. Later, Joe sees Sarah, who is seen struggling with wallpaper in her car. Joe appears to fancy her, as Sarah tells him her name and he flirts with her. Joe then helps an acquaintance of Sarah's to complete a wall papering and paint job in Sarah's flat. Sarah then leaves the lads to it. She later brings them tea as they paint the ceiling and sing to themselves. They then look outside and notice someone taking photos of them through the window. Joe runs outside with his can of white paint and brush to confront the man who was taking the photos. The photographer tells Joe that he was just doing his job and that he has a bad heart. Joe then paints all over the photographer's car. The car speeds away and manages to knock over a pile of rubbish by the side of the road. Later, Sarah and Joe have dinner together. They are able to make comfortable conversation with one another. There is a bottle of red wine on the table, but Joe does not drink any of the alcohol. Sarah's telephone rings and she leaves the kitchen to answer it. Joe is then left alone with the wine. He clears his plate and appears somewhat nervous. When Sarah finishes with her telephone conversation, Joe asks her about the photographs on her wall. Joe later reveals to Sarah that he does not drink, to which Sarah replies: 'Why didn't you say?' Joe reveals that he is an alcoholic and he has not had a drink in ten months. Joe is happy that Sarah knows and that she has been direct in her responses to him. Joe thanks Sarah for her company. Sarah pays Joe for the work that he completed on her flat and they part company. Joe attends the Mayfield Health Centre. The practice is very busy and the receptionist tries to cope with a patient who is complaining because he has been waiting a long time in order to receive his prescription. Joe tells the receptionist that he would like to see Sarah. The receptionist does not appear to be surprised by his request and says that Joe is free to pop his head around the door. He sees Sarah advising parents on dealing with the changing of nappies. Outside the Health Centre, Joe asks Sarah if she would like to go ten-pin bowling with him and to ring him if she fancies going. They then part company. Sarah speaks with a female colleague, Maggie, and says that Joe seems a bit wild. She states that she is not going to go bowling with Joe. The next shot is of a bowling alley, with 'Spirit in the Sky' playing in the background. Sarah and Joe bowl together and laugh at their many errors. They occupy Aisle 16 and neither of them are spectacular players. They go back to Sarah's place where she asks him in for a cup of tea. Joe politely says no. Sarah offers him money for a taxi. A friendly argument ensues, at the end of which Sarah finds herself locked out of her flat. Sarah says that she can sleep in her car. Joe states that Sarah can sleep at his place, but not necessarily together. They arrive at Joe's and he shows her around his flat. While Joe makes tea for Sarah, she asks him if it is alright to put some music on. She puts on the same piece of music that the audience heard during the opening credits of the film, Beethoven's Violin Concerto in D Major. Joe tells Sarah that he used to be in a band and they won a local talent contest. Joe tells Sarah a story of how he was desperate for a drink one day and what transpired. He went to a music shop and stole some cassettes. He took one of them home and 'got pissed.' He describes the experience as being 'magical.' When Sarah asks him what made him stop drinking, Joe asks her why she wants to know. He is not hostile, but curious. Joe says that he is scared to tell her and that there is a strong chance that she will hate him if he tells. Joe explains that there was a girl he used to drink with and they loved one another. They were both 'just tangled up' and they used to get into terrible arguments and tear one another apart. The audience then sees a flashback where Joe and the girl are returning home from a night out. He states that 'a cloud just descended... really, really dark. And suddenly I hated her. I hated me.' He describes how he tried to open the door, but was unable to; when the partner whom he was with laughed at him, Joe lost control because she found it funny. He beat her by punching and kicking her, while she lay helpless on the ground. He screamed abuse at her. The next day, he had a blackout. Now, he remembers every punch and kick. He states how ashamed and disgusted he is with himself. He is obviously contrite and he has not yet forgiven himself for his actions. In the next shot, Sarah comforts Joe and tells him that it is okay. The next scene is of a football match. Joe sees three men beating up Liam. Joe attempts to intervene. He helps Liam up and asks him if he is still clean. Liam states that he is. Liam confronts his wife when she comes home. He suspects that she has been using and asks her if she 'takes him for a prick.' Liam then yells that he will leave her to rot, grabs her by her neck and forces her to look at herself in the mirror. Joe then attends Liam's flat and encounters Liam's wife shooting up in the bathroom. An argument erupts between them. Joe offers to help her. She does not want the kind of help that Joe offers. Joe then reluctantly assists her to tie off one of her veins so that she can shoot up. Joe tries to make sense of her incoherent mumbles as she lies prostrate in the bathtub. Joe then goes to a snooker club where he asks after Liam's whereabouts. Joe tells one of the men that he encounters that Liam has a four-year-old boy in an attempt to mitigate matters. Liam says that he does not want them to take liberties. He comes across Liam and is cross because Liam told him that he had stopped dealing. A tearful Liam confesses that he still owes money. Joe also tells Liam that he suspects that his wife is on the game. He is worried that people are going to break his legs. Joe and Sarah prepare a meal together, which is interrupted when they have sex. The next day, Joe goes to Stella Maris' B & B in order to deal with the matter of Liam. In a later scene, Joe gives Sarah a pair of earrings, as well as a ring. Joe tells Sarah that he loves her. Sarah tells him that she does not want it and Joe cannot understand what he has done wrong. Joe is confused as to why Sarah has behaved in this fashion. In the next shot, we see a copy of the Alcoholics Anonymous' small blue Bible as Joe listens to Beethoven's Violin Concerto in D Major and makes notes in a book. When Sarah arrives at his door, she apologises. They drink tea together and later embrace. Joe drives his van and his mates direct him to a place where they rob another van. At the outset, Joe does not know where they are going. Joe is shocked with his unwitting role in the robbery of Astral Sports. He still acts as the get-away driver. At the next football match, Joe cleverly remarks that the other team look like budgies because of their blue and yellow striped uniforms. Meanwhile, Sarah reveals to her co-worker Maggie that she is pregnant. Maggie congratulates her. At Sarah's flat, she expresses her reservations about Joe's dealings with Liam. Joe tells her that there are some things that she does not need to know. Joe outlines the limited choices that Liam faces, most of which are not pleasant. Sarah accuses Joe of being a drug dealer and asks where he got the money for her earrings and ring. Joe replies that the gang gave him some money. Sarah becomes enraged and asks, 'Are you going to hit me too, Joe?' Joe attends Liam's flat and states that Liam must deal with things himself. Joe returns to his flat with bottles of Smirnoff Vodka. He pours himself a drink, and takes a sip. Liam then goes to Joe's flat, where Joe is very inebriated. Joe does not understand why Liam has come to see him. Joe calls Liam a 'stupid wee prick.' The alcohol has overtaken Joe and he is hostile to Liam, who needs his help. As Liam witnesses members of the gang coming towards the premises, Liam realises that Joe has passed out and he kisses Joe on his forehead. Joe suddenly snaps awake and realises that Liam has taken his own life by hanging himself. The film concludes with Liam's funeral.
6189444Unlucky plumber – Athanasius Borshchov   and his friend Fedulov  spend all day and night avoiding work and finding opportunities to drink. Afonya takes ""kickbacks"" from clients and is often in trouble with the local committee for his behaviour. Afonya meets plasterer Kolya  in a pub, gets drunk and comes home. When his girlfriend sees the state he's in, she leaves him. The next morning he can't even remember yesterday's drinking companion. Things continue to go downhill for Afonya. When student interns from the vocational school are allocated to the plumbers, master ZHEK Vostryakovo  doesn't allocate any to him, fearing that he will not teach them well. Afonya begs for trainees and gets two. Having worked with him for one day and having seen his attitude and working methods, the trainees refuse to work with him anymore. The next day, Kolya arrives to live at Afonya's, having been thrown out of his house by his wife. At a dance Afonya meets young nurse Katya Snegireva , who knows about him through her brother, who used to play in Afonya's volleyball team. Afonya doesn't pay her much attention, because he's more interested in older women and already has his eye on one at the dance. However, a romantic walk with the older woman after the dance is over before it begins – Afonya is challenged to a fight by a hooligan, who he'd quarrelled with at the dance. The hooligan's friends join in, and finish the unequal fight. Katya worries for Afonya's safety, and calls the militia - which will only bring Anfonya to the committee's attention again. At a regular work call Borshchov meets Helen  and falls in love at first sight. He starts finding any excuse to work in her flat - even fooling a tenant, astronomer , by swapping his new Finnish sink for an old one, so he can install the Finnish sink in Helen's home as a gift. In his dreams Athos sees a family idyll with his wife Helen and their perfect children. Katya Snegireva, head over heels for Afonya, keeps engineering new meetings with him, and stops at nothing to attract his attention: ""Athanasius! someone called, I thought it was – you ... "". Afonya is completely oblivious to her feelings. Meanwhile Afonya's run in with the militia catches up with him and, for persistent drunkenness, truancy and fighting Afonya is threatened with being sacked at a meeting of the local committee. In addition, if he doesn't restore the Finnish sink he's definitely going to be fired. Afonya takes a porcelain sink with flowers to Helen to swap with the Finnish sink, but meets Helen coming home with company. She makes her feelings quite clear: she has her own life among fashionable and wealthy men, and Afonya is just a plumber. Afonya, depressed, goes to a restaurant with Fedulov and tries to escape into drunkenness, but it doesn't help. In his drunken state he goes to Katya Snegireva's home and proposes marriage, and wakes up next to her in the morning. Katya tells him she's due to move to Africa with work and wonders if she should cancel for Afonya. Afonya then decides to go back to his village, to his aunt Frosya , who brought him up. In the village, he meets his childhood friend Concertina  and, in a joyous moment sends the city a telegram resigning from his job and giving up his apartment. Only then does he learn that Aunt Frosya died two years ago. Afonya's depression increases – he has lost everything and has nowhere to go. Neighbour Uncle Yegor  gives Athos his Aunt Frosya's legacy – savings account in his name, the deeds to her house, and the letters she'd sent to herself, pretending they were from Afonya to the neighbours . The guilt of having ignored her only increases his gloom. Athanasius goes to the post office and tries to call Katya Snegireva on her memorable phone number 50-50-2, or as he says himself, ""rug-rug or two."" The answer comes back - Katya has left. Finally frustrated, he goes to the airport. He does not care where he's going or what will happen to him. Things have gotten so bad that a local militia man has to be convinced Afonya is the man in his passport photograph, so grim has he gotten since it was taken. Finally, just when Athanasius is heading to the AN-2 aircraft , a familiar girlish voice calls out. It's Katya, suitcase in hand: ""Athanasius!, someone called, I thought it was – you ... "

Ducci leaves on a business trip, and Virginia experiences more visions—she sees an old woman murdered, a wall being torn down and a letter hidden beneath a statue. Virginia plans to renovate an abandoned mansion her husband has bought, but notices that the building resembles one she has seen in her visions.

Assuming the skeleton is that of the woman in her vision, Virginia contacts the police; however, they do not believe her story and charge Ducci with the killing.

She asks Aunt Bam to call her children so she can tell them. Cora and Mr. Brown are at the hospital, to get Mr. Brown a check-up. Dr. Evans tells them he has to do a colonoscopy on Mr. Brown, and they find a growth that needs to be removed surgically. Meanwhile, Madea drives her car through a restaurant because they stopped serving breakfast. Shirley's children Byron, Tammy, and Kimberly arrive at the dinner. Byron arrives with his girlfriend Renee and his baby Byron Jr. Tammy arrives with her husband Harold and their two kids. Tammy and Harold fighting about directions. Kimberly arrives with her husband Calvin. Tammy and Kimberly start to fight, and Byron's ex-girlfriend Sabrina arrives. Sabrina is Byron's baby momma, and she likes calling Byron a drug dealer, since he was one when he was young and got arrested because of it, and she loudly extends his name, just to annoy him and his family. Sabrina also happens to be the manager of 'Smax', the restaurant that Madea crashed into. Everybody leaves for their own reasons and Shirley doesn't get the chance to tell them about her cancer. During the night, Byron and Renee sneak inside Shirley's house to sleep there, but Byron gets arrested by the police for back child support. Shirley goes to Kimberly's house to ask her to bail him out, but Kimberly refuses. Calvin instead helps Shirley bail him out. Aunt Bam tells Madea about the cancer and the family’s situation and Madea promises to gather all Shirley’s children for dinner that evening. She goes to Harold’s garage where Tammy works and tells her to go to the family dinner. Tammy gets called by a client, so Madea disciplines Tammy’s children for their disrespect, which puts fear into them. She then goes to Byron’s workplace, but she finds him outside, since he was fired for being late as he spent the night in jail. She proceeds to Kimberly, whom she finds her showing clients a house and she yells at her to attend the dinner. Meanwhile, Mr. Brown loses a lot of blood during his surgery and the doctor asks Cora to donate some. When she does, she finds out that she doesn't have the same blood type as him, implying that he may not be her real father. At dinner, Tammy and Kimberly have a vicious argument that leads to Tammy revealing that Kimberly is Byron’s birth mother, having had him when she 13 years old. Byron storms out of the house, angry this was kept from him. For the first time, Harold put his foot down towards Tammy and tells her to respect him more. Tammy and Harold then sort their problems out because of the way things didn't work out between the two. Harold acted weak because Tammy acted like she was the boss of him, which led their children to show no respect for their parents or anyone else. Over time, Shirley’s condition worsens greatly and she goes to the hospital; she tells Byron, Tammy, Harold, and Calvin, who arrive to see her, that she loves them all, including Kimberly who isn’t present, and she dies. After Shirley's funeral service, Madea confronts the family, saying that Shirley was a peaceful woman and she didn't want all the fighting going on. First, Madea confronts Sabrina about abusing Byron’s hard-earned money, and that she must start respecting him, especially telling her to stop using their child to make his life look miserable or she will be dealing with Madea or worse. Second, Madea confronts Byron and tells him to get a job in order go on the right path, because selling drugs will lead him to his own demise and Renee will just move on to the next man with a lot of money. Madea also wants Byron to start taking care of his baby and settle things between him and Sabrina together. Third, Madea tells everyone that Shirley didn't want her children to know that Kimberly was raped by an uncle when she was 12, which is why she became so hostile and aggressive towards everyone, because she didn't forgive the man that raped her. Kimberly sorts her issues with Calvin, feeling that she doesn't know how to begin, and finally hugs him and apologizes. Byron breaks up with Renee, because he just buried his mother while Renee only thinks about herself. He later forgives Kimberly . The film ends with Madea, Mr. Brown, and Cora on The Maury Povich Show to find out if Mr. Brown is in fact Cora's father. Madea says he is, but it turns out he's not. This surprises Madea who runs off-stage, sobbing hysterically .

There she sees that her relatives are more interested in her money than her ill health. Surprisingly, her cousin Kamala marries a man of different religion. She takes care of her family becoming a housewife. She becomes an instrument in Aruna's comprehension of human nature. In the end when Aruna is ill again due to consumption, she finds that she and her children need a safer abode than her own home. She goes to Bhaskar's family, and she sees that outward appearances do not account for inner purity. The Dalit In-law family takes care of Aruna and her two children. Bhaskar comes to her and Aruna dies in his arms apologising for sacrificing so many lives with her decisions. And thus the title, Balipeetam: The pedestal of Sacrifice. The core issues of Intercaste marriages and Interpersonal relations are woven into the movie .Discussion about the plot in a blogspot.

Cornacchia, a shoemaker, finds out that a Carbonari associate, prince Filippo Spada, is going to reveal the organization's plans for an uprising to the Pontifical Guard's commander, Colonel Nardoni. He then goes off to warn his friend Leonida Montanari, a doctor and head of the conspirators, who decides to take out the informer. He and Angelo Targhini, a newcomer from the Duchy of Modena, attempt to murder Spada but ultimately fail to deliver the final blow. Spada manages to survive the attack and report his assailants to the police, having them both arrested and subsequently, after a summary judgement, sentenced to death by Cardinal Rivarola. Meanwhile Giuditta, Cornacchia's Jewish workshop assistant, who was previously in love with Montanari, has started to develop feelings for Targhini after first meeting him, unaware of Cornacchia's feelings towards her. While the two Carbonari are imprisoned in Castel Sant'Angelo, an idealist friar is sent to convince them to repent from their sins, stating that they cannot be executed until.their souls are considered saved. They try to take advantage of this by delaying the execution for as long as possible. One day, after Giuditta accuses him of cowardice, Cornacchia reveals to her that he is actually Pasquino, the mysterious author of satirical poems against the Pope and the government. Out of his love for Giuditta, he decides to make a deal with Rivarola: he would reveal Pasquino's identity in exchange for the conspirators' lives. Rivarola, who already suspects him, pretends to agree and gives him a note, telling him to personally deliver it to Nardoni at Castel Sant'Angelo to have the prisoners released. The note actually says to arrest him at once, but if Cornacchia were to protest, he would give away that he can actually read, thus confirming Rivarola's suspicions. The shoemaker, with his disciple Bellachioma, writes a poem in which he asks to hurry the execution of the two Carbonari, explaining to his pupil that only their deaths may lead the people to consciousness. Then, after appointing Bellachioma as the new Pasquino, he joins a convent to escape Rivarola's persecution. In the meantime, people from the streets assault Castel Sant'Angelo, leading Montanari to believe that they are gonna revolt and set them free, but he soon learns that even his fellow citizens want them dead. The friar meets with Rivarola and asks him to delay the execution, believing that every soul must be saved, but the cardinal just shrugs him off. Eventually, the execution day comes and, just as the condemned are about step towards the guillotine, the friar shows up and desperately implores them to repent, but they politely refuse. Refusing to give up, the friar says he's going to absolve them anyway, at the cost of having to deal with God himself, but Rivarola's men stop him from doing so. In the end, Targhini is decapitated and Montanari, before being executed as well, takes one last gaze upon the citizens of Rome gathered in Piazza del Popolo and says: ""Good night, people."""

The note actually says to arrest him at once, but if Cornacchia were to protest, he would give away that he can actually read, thus confirming Rivarola's suspicions. The shoemaker, with his disciple Bellachioma, writes a poem in which he asks to hurry the execution of the two Carbonari, explaining to his pupil that only their deaths may lead the people to consciousness. Then, after appointing Bellachioma as the new Pasquino, he joins a convent to escape Rivarola's persecution. In the meantime, people from the streets assault Castel Sant'Angelo, leading Montanari to believe that they are gonna revolt and set them free, but he soon learns that even his fellow citizens want them dead. The friar meets with Rivarola and asks him to delay the execution, believing that every soul must be saved, but the cardinal just shrugs him off. Eventually, the execution day comes and, just as the condemned are about step towards the guillotine, the friar shows up and desperately implores them to repent, but they politely refuse. Refusing to give up, the friar says he's going to absolve them anyway, at the cost of having to deal with God himself, but Rivarola's men stop him from doing so. In the end, Targhini is decapitated and Montanari, before being executed as well, takes one last gaze upon the citizens of Rome gathered in Piazza del Popolo and says: ""Good night, people."""

They try to take advantage of this by delaying the execution for as long as possible. One day, after Giuditta accuses him of cowardice, Cornacchia reveals to her that he is actually Pasquino, the mysterious author of satirical poems against the Pope and the government. Out of his love for Giuditta, he decides to make a deal with Rivarola: he would reveal Pasquino's identity in exchange for the conspirators' lives. Rivarola, who already suspects him, pretends to agree and gives him a note, telling him to personally deliver it to Nardoni at Castel Sant'Angelo to have the prisoners released. The note actually says to arrest him at once, but if Cornacchia were to protest, he would give away that he can actually read, thus confirming Rivarola's suspicions. The shoemaker, with his disciple Bellachioma, writes a poem in which he asks to hurry the execution of the two Carbonari, explaining to his pupil that only their deaths may lead the people to consciousness. Then, after appointing Bellachioma as the new Pasquino, he joins a convent to escape Rivarola's persecution. In the meantime, people from the streets assault Castel Sant'Angelo, leading Montanari to believe that they are gonna revolt and set them free, but he soon learns that even his fellow citizens want them dead. The friar meets with Rivarola and asks him to delay the execution, believing that every soul must be saved, but the cardinal just shrugs him off. Eventually, the execution day comes and, just as the condemned are about step towards the guillotine, the friar shows up and desperately implores them to repent, but they politely refuse. Refusing to give up, the friar says he's going to absolve them anyway, at the cost of having to deal with God himself, but Rivarola's men stop him from doing so. In the end, Targhini is decapitated and Montanari, before being executed as well, takes one last gaze upon the citizens of Rome gathered in Piazza del Popolo and says: ""Good night, people."""

He is soon released with the help of the local clergy and, disappointed by the unfulfilled promise of the new government, Crocco is persuaded by the cleric Don Pietro  to become the leader of the resistance against Victor Emmanuel II, promising him money and weapons. Thus Crocco joins the Bourbon side, forming an army composed mainly of poor people. The brigand and his men conquer the Vulture region in the name of king Francis II, gaining the support of the local population. The new Italian government is worried about this rebellion and General Enrico Cialdini  is assigned to suppress it. The repression is cruel; Cialdini orders the shooting of the brigands and anyone who deals with them, mass killings  and confiscation of basic necessities. Meanwhile, the Bourbon government in exile sends the Spanish General José Borjes  to Basilicata, to reinforce and discipline the bands. Crocco does not trust Borjes from the start because he is worried about losing his leadership, but he accepts the alliance. After some victorious battles, Crocco breaks the alliance with Borjes because he does not want to serve under a foreigner.

One day she decides to see for herself, exploring around the tunnel. After a brief scare due to a large rat, she tries to give it some food but the rat instead runs down a burrow. Emily accidentally slides down the burrow while investigating it and is amazed when she comes face to face with a centuries old dragon. The dragon is at first grouchy and not happy with her been in his lair, which is full of 'treasure', although this is mainly discarded items from the trains. As the two talk more, they begin to become friends. Later, the dragon reveals there were once many other dragons long ago but there are now only a few left as they were hunted down by humans, as humans feared dragons because of their size. He also reveals that it is the 'Day of Tidings', a secret celebration for dragons, but that he will not be going as it is too dangerous to travel and that the Tidings are too far away. Emily, however, convinces him to go to the Tidings, with the dragon agreeing and also stating he will take Emily with him, much to her delight. However, she then remembers that her Grandma is coming over for dinner and that she has missed it. Although she leaves, she agrees to meet the dragon at the mouth of the tunnel at Moon-rise so they can go together. Upon returning home, Emily is sent to her room by her parents for missing dinner, although she later sneaks out and meets the dragon on top of the railway tunnel, although he states they won't be flying when there are 'better ways'. A few moments later, the pair jump off the tunnel and begin to ride on the roof of a train, with Emily going inside and getting some smoked meat sandwiches for the Dragon  Emily nearly gets in trouble when the Conductor appears and asks for her ticket, but the Dragon  gives him a pair of out-of-date tickets which distracts him as Emily and the Dragon escape off the train. After hiding from two hunters  and their bloodhounds, the pair continue on foot while continuing conversation. They soon reach the location, with the Dragon convincing the others  to show themselves, showing Emily how to shout tidings. Both Emily and the Dragons have a fun time playing various party games, dancing and eating popcorn. Later, Emily convinces the old dragon to fly after watching one of the other dragons flying, with him taking her for a fun ride in the sky despite having not flown for 100 years. With storm clouds approaching, the pair head for home. However, the dragon is shot in the wing by the hunters and crashes outside the railway tunnel, knocking Emily unconscious. Putting her out of harm's way, the Dragon scares off the hunters and their dogs before slumping down against the tunnel wall and seemingly disappearing. Emily's father finds her later on and brings her home. In the days that follow, no one believes her stories about the Dragon, instead believing she simply imagined him due to falling unconscious. Soon after, Emily searches the tunnel and the dragon's lair but is sad when she cannot find him, even after shouting tidings numerous times. However, the Dragon re-appears  and the two friends share a hug, with the narrator stating that it doesn't matter what others think, as things are true, if they are true in our hearts.

In it is a man called Clutch Powers  and he jumps off looking for a power crystal. He sees a variety of them, but finally sees a large one. He grabs it and suddenly the Queen Rock Monster wakes up and chases Clutch to his Underground Headquarters. Clutch gets the power crystal by shooting himself over the Queen and ends up stuck in a cave. However, the crystal opens up to reveal itself as a Rock Monster baby. Realizing his mistake, Clutch returns the baby to the Queen, apologizing for his action and stating that he only wants a power crystal. Understanding the point, the Queen Rock Monster gives Clutch a real power crystal, allowing him to leave. Clutch returns to Lego City and hands the crystal to his boss Kjeld Playwell  who assigns him some new teammates: Brick Masterson  firefighter weapons specialist and demolition expert, Peg Mooring  a biologist, and Bernie von Beam  an engineer. Using the crystal to power up the supercomputers, Playwell informs of an incident in the Space Police prison planet when chaos occurs regarding to the imprisonment of the three most wanted criminals in the Lego galaxy. He then orders Clutch and his team to investigate the situation at once, despite the team's lack of cooperation and Clutch's intent of working alone. They meet up with Arthur 'Artie' Fol  who is a Clutch Powers fan. He creates a police space ship that will transport them to the prison planet, so they leave in the afternoon. Peg meets up with Clutch and finds out that he had a dark past with his lost father Rock Powers; it is also revealed the symbol in the Space Prison video footage during the attack is the same one in Rock's journal regarding to his last whereabouts. Before Clutch can speak further, Brick interrupts to tell them that they have arrived at the planet. They get into their astronaut suits and they enter the prison building. They see that someone is stuck in one of the prisoners' cells, but they are attacked by an unseen wizard, who happens to be one of the criminals leading the other two. The criminals then disappear and Clutch and his friends break the person out of the cell, revealing himself to be Watch Commander. Clutch and his team attempt to go after the criminals, though the Watch Commander comforts them by stating that he has pulled off the spark plugs of all ships to ensure that the criminals will never escape from the planet. Unfortunately, the criminals have taken the team's ship  and destroy the other ships, inciting the Watch Commander to berate the team for their arguing and their lack of cooperation. Feeling guilty, Clutch decides to take action and builds a new ship for the team to move on, declaring that a team arguing with each other while being ordered to do their tasks is the sole reason why he always works alone. During the trip back, the team is informed by Playwell that the symbol refers to Omega, one of the two criminals led by the evil wizard, and that the criminals have gone their separate ways following the escape. Playwell also informs that the evil wizard who planned the escape is none other than Mallock the Malign, infamous for terrorizing a medieval planet named Ashlar. The planet's ruler, who was the late King, was informed to having sacrificed his own life to ensure his kingdom's safety and Mallock's previous imprisonment, and has left his son Prince Varen with his powerful golden sword to rule, despite Prince Varen's incapability of preparing in battle. Playwell then orders Clutch and the team to head over there to capture Mallock. The team manages to get to Ashlar, but their ship accidentally knocks down Lego-Henge . They get off and take refuge in a Medieval camp with extra parts, but not after witnessing a group of armed skeletons marching down the forests, realizing that Mallock has gained a stranglehold of Ashlar around his fortress with a skeleton army acting as his own forces. As Peg, Brick, and Bernie create a battle chariot, Clutch leaves to get Prince Varen to convince him to fight against Mallock. Meanwhile in Mallock's fortress, Mallock learns of the team's presence and orders his two skeleton henchmen Skelly and Bones to go after Clutch so they can find the prince and the golden sword to finalize his takeover of Ashlar. Back in the forest, Clutch ends up in a bridge but a troll named Hogar refuses to let him across until Clutch solves three riddles. Though Clutch gets them all right, Skelly and Bones catch up with him after a failed attempt to trap him, demanding Hogar to surrender Clutch to them at once. Hogar attempts to ward off the skeletons by hypnotizing them, but they don't fall for it, prompting an annoyed Hogar to eat Clutch and runs away to a secret doorway that is painted like an ending forest to escape the skeletons. Having escaped Skelly and Bones, Hogar throws Clutch out of his stomach on the other side and shows him the way to the kingdom of Prince Varen, telling him about the history of his father and the golden sword. Hogar also tells Clutch that he was the only troll that was on the kingdom's team and that he was assigned to protect Varen. Back at the Medieval Camp, Bernie develops a crush on Peg, who leaves to look for a relaxing land, but later befriends a dragon. Back in the kingdom, Clutch finds Prince Varen and he helps him wield a sword but he fails and gets angry at Clutch. Clutch protests that he was trying to help him defeat the Wizard team, but Varen rejects him, confessing that he's scared of Mallock. Enraged, Clutch goes back to the camp and sees that a dwarf will help them so they set out to stop Mallock on their own. Eventually, Prince Varen, Hogar, and their knights find out that Clutch was telling the truth and decide to give a shot in their battle against Mallock. Varen and Clutch stow away in the back of Mallock's castle by making Peg a fake Varen. Unfortunately, Mallock plays wise to their moves and traps them in a bone cage outside a lava river and the growing Skeleton Army drove the knights away to retreat. Back in the castle, Mallock makes a screen in front of the clouds to show them that Clutch and Varen will be killed unless the golden sword is surrendered to him immediately. Having no choice, Hogar brings the golden sword's case to Mallock so he can free them, only to find that's it empty at the last minute. Enraged, Mallock traps Hogar in lightning and throws him back to the doorway of Varen's castle, leaving him trapped. Varen and Clutch make a message to the team so they can rely on themselves. Bernie gets fueled up by hope and they rebuild their broken chariot. They reunite with the knights and they attack the Skeleton Army. Back in the castle, Peg finally get the dragon to cut down the cage, freeing Clutch and Varen, who then get to the gates, where they find the golden sword that was left earlier, since Mallock didn't bother to search for it. After very much convincing from Clutch, Varen finally decides to face his fear of Mallock to ensure his kingdom's safety. Around the same time, Mallock attempts to lure Clutch into giving the sword to him by promising to lead him to his father, but Clutch refuses. As Clutch watches Varen using the golden sword to fight against Mallock, Brick uses a jetpack and lands in the eye of Mallock's fortress and fights with Skelly and Bones. Despite Brick being outnumbered by Skelly and Bones, Bernie helps him by throwing a disc at the skeletons and they get killed. Back inside the fortress, Mallock taunts Varen of retaining his title as Prince of Ashlar as he uses his staff to attack Varen. However, Varen finally engulfs enough power from Mallock's staff into his sword, allowing the sword to unleash its full power, much to Mallock's shock. Taking the opportunity, Varen uses the sword to trap Mallock with a glowing chain, declaring Mallock under arrest and himself the new King of Ashlar. Following Mallock's defeat, Hogar is freed from his restrains and the Skeleton army disappears into puffs of smoke, leaving Clutch's team and the knights to celebrate their victory. With peace declared open in Ashlar, Varen is then officially declared the new King, and when Clutch and his team pack up to transport the chained Mallock back to Lego City, Varen thanks him for being loyal and for being part of the team.

Her father is an antiques salesman who loves his stock too much to sell it and therefore doesn't make any money. Through her friend Molly, Vera manages to get a job at Miller's music instrument factory in a menial job. Vera has a habit of going into shops and trying on expensive clothes and jewellery which she could never hope to pay for. On her way home from work she stops in a car dealer and sits in a new luxury car. Robert Miller, the young son of the owner of Miller's factory, sees Vera and falls instantly in love with her. He pretends to be an employee at the car showroom and they bond together. On a whim, he decides to buy Vera the car and pretends she has won it as the 10,000th customer to visit the shop. Vera's father is delighted by the new car, but her mother is more suspicious. Miller wants to spend more time with Vera, but he is uncertain about telling her his true identity in part because he is constantly harassed by women who are interested in his inheritance. He approaches the Hart family and offers to chauffeur the car for them, doing jobs such as weddings to pay for it. As none of them can drive, they accept his offer. Miller gets into the habit of driving Vera to work at the factory, still not revealing the truth that his family owns the business. When he discovers how little she is paid, he has her salary raised to five pounds a week. Unfortunately this leads to bad feeling amongst Vera's colleagues, in particular her superior Henry Butterworth and Anne Fisher who has a crush on Miller, who suspect that Vera is the fancy woman of Miller. Vera is bemused by her pay rise because she is under the impression that she has never met Miller. When Vera comes to his office to confront Miller about her increased salary, he hides and gets his friend Peters to pretend to be him. Peters takes a shine to Vera, and tries to persuade her to go out on a date with him. Once she has gone, Miller and Peters get into an argument over whether each of them have a shot with her and whether she is more interested in love or money. The debate is put to the test when Vera, Miller and Peters all head down to a country hotel for an ice-skating carnival. A concerned Mr Butterworth and Miss Fisher also head down to the hotel to keep an eye on Vera, and are shocked when they see her separately with both Peters and Miller, believing that she is two timing them. Still without revealing his true identity, Miller asks Vera to live with him for ever in a couple of rooms over a garage. She joyfully accepts, but when Butterworth tells her who Miller really is she is hurt - thinking that his offer was not one of marriage but one of a kept woman. She then pretends to be uninterested in Miller and instead focuses her attention on Peters. Eventually however the confusion is resolved and Miller and Vera drive off together in their “car of dreams”.

In an unnamed town, young girls are dying of a mysterious wasting disease. Dr John Carter  and his daughter Dolores  have been tending to patients for hours on end, but lost one patient an hour ago. Another patient, Cora , looks like she will pull through after Preacher Dan Young's  nightlong vigil; he and the Carters are offered breakfast and coffee by Cora's parents . In the kitchen, however, they hear Cora scream – by the time they get to her room, she is sprawled dead on her bed, her window open. As he kneels to pray, Dan notices two small, bloody holes in Cora’s throat... Returning to his ranch along with Dolores, Doc Carter finds his son Tim ([[Jimmy Murphy  extremely upset after the actions of their neighbour Buffer, who has been doing everything possible to get his hands on the Carter property, including damming a stream on the Carter ranch and having his men assault anyone who complains. To restrain his hot-headed son, the Doc drives back into town to have a word with the local sheriff . The Sheriff’s discussion with Buffer ([[Bruce Gordon  in the local saloon proves less than successful, however, and a black-clad stranger  follows Doc Carter’s buckboard. By the time he gets home, the Doc is dead, his throat bloody... Already grief-stricken over the loss of his father, Tim snaps after learning that a fence has been torn down and cattle are escaping. Convinced Buffer is responsible, Tim plies himself with booze and then goes after Buffer in the saloon; unfortunately Buffer is a much better shot, and Tim is killed. Alone now, Dolores hangs up ""Gun Wanted"" posters all over town, offering $100 to anyone who can gun down the ""murderer""; the stranger picks one up and heads into the saloon for a talk with Buffer. After the stranger promises that he’ll kill Buffer if he takes the job, one of the rancher's men shoots at the stranger, apparently missing. As the stranger leaves Buffer sacks the man who fired the shot, despite his insisting he hit his target dead center. Buffer scoffs – nobody can survive that... The stranger, identifying himself as Drake Robey, arrives at the Carter ranch to take the job to kill Buffer. As he does he reacts to a cross made from a thorn set on a button worn by Dan. When asked, Dan says he received it upon his ordination; apparently the thorn came from the site of the Crucifixion. Despite Dan’s protests, Dolores insists on hiring Robey and has him move into the house. That night, Robey sneaks into Dolores’ room and drinks some of her blood. Next morning Dan goes to ask Dolores to sack Robey, but is surprised to find her looking tired, complaining of cold and very compliant with his wishes. The gunman leaves after refusing payment for the time she had hired him for. Dolores and Dan spend the day going over her father's papers, looking for his will. One of the papers found is a map showing the Carter property had once belonged to a Spanish family, the Robles; the family apparently sold up after suffering ""some kind of tragedy"". As it’s growing late, Dan takes the paperwork, including a locked safety box, home with him to continue the search and try and put the paperwork in order. After Dan leaves, Robey comes to see Dolores; claiming his eyesight is going in bright light , he talks Dolores into accepting him as a night range-rider who can keep an eye on Buffer and his men while the rest of the ranch-hands are sleeping. She offers him the cemetery caretaker’s old cottage to stay in as long as he doesn’t mind being near the dead; Robey is amused at the thought, saying ""The dead don’t bother me – it’s the living that causes me trouble."" As Dan looks through the paperwork he knocks over the safety box, cracking it open. In it, he finds a diary written in 1860 by Don Miguel Robles , the former owner of the land. According to the diary, Don Robles sent his son Drago to Madrid on business without his new bride Isabella . In Drago's absence, Isabella turned to Drago's brother Roberto  for companionship. When Drago returned and discovered their relationship, he killed his brother with a dagger; unable to live with his deed, Drago later committed suicide with the same dagger. Over the next six months the district was plagued by the mysterious deaths of young girls. One night Don Robles heard Isabella scream and came into her room to find a man bent over her – Drago Robles, dead some six months - who fled, leaving Isabella drained of blood. In order to end the curse, Don Robles plunged a silver dagger through Drago’s heart as he lay in his coffin. After confessing his actions to the priest he found out that he needed to use a wooden stake instead to destroy a vampire – but on returning to the coffin he found it empty except for the dagger. Confirming the story is a photograph of Don Drago Robles hidden in the diary – it’s Drake Robey in Spanish clothing... As Dan reads Don Robles’ diary, Robey/Robles summons a sleeping Dolores to him to feed from, but is interrupted by the sheriff. After hearing the sheriff denounce him to Dolores, Robey follows him back to town and kills him with his bite. As Dan starts back to his house after examining the body, he is pursued by an unseen Robey; in a panic he races for the church, and Robey is caught in the shadow of the church cross and flees. Back in his house Dan is confronted by Robey; the vampire defends his actions, protesting ""What I am is not my own choice. You should pity me, not judge me in my torment. Do you think I wanted this?"" before attacking Dan, but flees with his photograph and the Rancho Robles map when interrupted by the preacher’s housekeeper. When Dan tells Dolores about the evening's events, Dolores  doesn't believe him. Dan promptly drags her to the family crypt to find Drago Robles’ coffin, which proves to be empty except for a silver dagger – just as the diary had said. When Dan insists they look in every coffin for Robey – including her father and brother – Dolores explodes and throws him out. After Dan leaves to get a court order to do so, Dolores, apparently weakened by blood loss, her anger at Dan’s insisting the coffins be opened, and possibly Robey’s hypnotic influence, collapses. Robey emerges from one of the Carter coffins to feed from Dolores before carrying her back home. After Dolores awakens, confused at how she got home from the crypt, Robey shows her the Rancho Robles map; the stream Buffer has been damming up is on her property, not Buffer’s. Robey goes into town to show the map to Buffer, who refuses to accept it and shoots Robey. Robey fires back, killing Buffer, and walks away unscathed. After reporting back to Dolores – claiming his cigar case stopped Buffer’s bullet after she sees a bullet hole in his vest – Robey learns that Dan is heading for the county seat to get a court order to open the graves. Robey promises to join with Dolores to stop him, not saying that he plans to stop his rival permanently. Warned by Dolores’ housekeeper, Dan makes preparations. Robey heads for town to ""talk"" Dan out of getting that court order , but Dan won't be stopped. They challenge each other to a shoot-out, and Dan fires first, just as Dolores arrives. Robey collapses and disintegrates into dust, leaving only his empty clothes behind. Dan walks over to Robey's clothes and picks up his bullet... which has his thorn cross on it."

During the opening ceremony of the line, Conan Edogawa and the Detective Boys are driven by Hiroshi Agasa and pass under the Touto Line. Conan, having heard about the threatening letter, notices explosives connected to the Touto railway; Using his original voice to inform the police as Shinichi Kudo, he is able to stop the train and divert traffic away from the explosives preventing any deaths. Conan researches Asakura's political history for a clue on the culprit and learns the governor was in charge of the construction of dam in Kitanosawa, a fictional town in the Niigata Prefecture. Due to the dam's construction, the citizens of Kitanosawa were forced into a new town and their old homes were drowned by the dam. Since Asakura's trip to celebrate the anniversary of the dam is canceled by the bombing, Conan speculates information on the bomber could be found in Kitanosawa and plans a trip there. Conan, the Detective Boys, Ran Mori, Kogoro Mori, and Sonoko Suzuki travel to Kitanosawa and enjoy the day playing. They are introduced to a group of locals; their names are Keisuke Yamao, Mizuki Toono, Fuyumi Tachihara, Takehiki Mutou, and Shougo Hikawa. The group reveals they were all childhood friends and were part of the group which relocated to the new village. They also reveal its their first gathering in eight years since Yamao was in prison for killing Toono's sister, Natsuki Toono, in a hit and run. The next day, Tachihara's son, Touma Tachihara, awakens from his eight year coma with no memory of his accident. Later that day, Hikawa is found dead in a field. Originally, it was assumed to be suicide since only Hikawa's footprints were found in the snow. Conan reveals Hikawa was killed by an electroshock weapon. The culprit then waited for it to snow and walked away backwards to suggest Hikawa was alone. During a diamond dust caused by the sunrise, Touma experiences a flashback on the day of the accident. Conan investigates Hikawa's belongings and finds a newspaper clipping detailing a jewelry store was robbed the day before the hit and run. A cell site is destroyed by bombs leading Conan to hypothesis who the culprit possibly is. Meanwhile, the Detective Boys and Touma are hunted down by a sniper. Conan intervenes and leads them to safety. Taking a route towards the dam, Conan explains Yamao is the culprit. Yamao robbed the jewelry store in a distant town and drives back to Kitanosawa. On the way, he runs over Natsuki, a scene which Touma notices. Touma is then kidnapped by Yamao and sees the diamonds, explaining why the diamond dust startled his memories. Touma escapes but falls down a cliff leading to his coma. Yamao then buries the jewels in a property in Kitanosawa and turns himself over to the authorities for Natsuki's death. Unexpectedly, the dam project forced the town of Kitanosawa underwater. As a result, Yamao decides to bomb the dam to search old-Kitanosawa for the diamonds. In order to have enough time to perform the search, he had to cancel the Governor's trip and destroy the cell site to prevent the outside world from learning off the dam's destruction. Upon arriving at the dam, Conan is pursued by Yamao who intends to kill him. Yamao is then shot and incapacitated by Toono. Touma regains his memories of the accident upon seeing Toono and reveals he saw Toono push Natsuki off into the road. Toona professes she was the sniper attempting to kill Touma and that the death of her sister was an accident. Yamao, having set off the bombs in the dam forces them to flee. Conan diverges from the group intending to start an avalanche by creating grooves in a steep mountain with his motorized snowboard to divert the flow away from Kitanosawa. He is successful but his motor short-circuits causing him to be caught in the avalanche. He is eventually free when Ran calls Shinichi's cellphone causing him to regain consciousness to alert the others of his position.

The Princess convinces Galgo to turn her into a small bird, so that she may fly off to warn Sinbad of the trap set against him. She flies off just as Galgo is found out by guards, and taken to El-Carim. Sindbad and his crew sail onward, and the Princess-Firebird soon arrives. But before she can deliver the message, El-Carim transforms the guards into giant human falcons, to drop rocks onto Sindbad's ship sinking it. However, Sindbad and some of his crew have survived, and they carefully make their way to shore. Galgo makes his arm stretch out to an enormous length, long enough to grab El-Carim's magic ring, but the evil king wakes up in time to burn Galgo's hand. Sindbad manages to get arrested, and soon appears before the dictator as a petty thief. El-Carim is not fooled, and knows that the man standing before him is the Princess' suitor, and orders him executed. However, Sindbad breaks free of his ropes and challenges the ruler. Sindbad stabs the King in the heart with a sword, but as El-Carim has no heart, and cannot be killed. El-Carim plans to put Sindbad to death the next day, in the public arena. Soon, the poor prisoner is tossed into the arena, where he must do battle with ""The Thing,"" a fearsome giant invisible monster Fortunately, the Thing knocks over a torch, starting a fire in the arena which incites a mass exodus, allowing Sindbad to escape. Sindbad visits Galgo, and finally convinces Galgo to tell him the secret of El-Carim's invincible rule: the madman has had his heart removed, and it is kept safe in a distant bell tower, guarded by supernatural forces El-Carim insists that the Princess marry him, but she refuses, and so is slated for execution. Sindbad and his men traverse the swamps of horror in order to reach the tower of the evil heart. They encounter carnivorous vines, giant prehistoric monsters, volcanic lava pits and whirlpools on the way, finally battling an ogre with the multiple heads of a dragon. When they reach the tower, Sindbad, with the aid of a hook, he begins to climb the immense rope to the top of the tower. Sindbad reaches the top of the tower, and finds El-Carim's beating heart encased in crystal. The heart is protected by a giant hand, which chases Sindbad all around the bell tower. Sindbad throws the hook at the crystal, which dislodges the evil heart, giving El-Carim a heart attack. Sindbad then manages to vanquish the monster hand. El-Carim and Galgo fly in a winged chariot towards the tower. Sindbad is about to impale the evil heart when El-Carim arrives on the scene. The two have a fierce swordfight while Galgo steals the wretched heart, and tosses it over the side of the tower. As it falls to the ground, El-Carim faints, and falls to his death. The entire kingdom then has a celebration for the marriage of the Princess and Captain Sindbad."

However Baron Hector Hulot , her late cousin's husband, still knowingly treats her as a ""housekeeper"", giving her charge over his daughter Hortense . Refusing the offer to stay in Hulot's home, Bette returns to her apartment in a rundown poorer district of Paris, where she makes costumes for a Burlesque theatre. She becomes friends with the headliner of the show, famed courtesan Jenny Cadine . Bette finds a source of comfort in Count Wenceslas Steinbach , a young but promising artist who has fallen on hard times. Besotted by the young man, Bette does everything possible to provide for him such as buying him food and motivating him to continue with his work. One day, Bette tells Hortense of her ""sweetheart"" Wenceslas. Intrigued, Hortense goes to an antique shop near Bette's apartment to look at some of his work. Wenceslas himself walks in and, instantly attracted to him, Hortense tells her father she has found her future husband and entreats him to use his influence to commission Wenceslas to create a prominent statue. Over time, Wenceslas starts sneaking out to court Hortense. Bette follows him one day after Jenny inadvertently arouses her suspicions by mentioning that Lord Hulot, who is her lover, gave her a piece of artwork that came from his future son-in-law; Bette recognizes the artwork as Wenceslas's. Furious at Wenceslas's betrayal, Bette swears revenge and enlists Jenny to help her. Bette's plan, in essence, is to turn the family members against each other. After the birth of Hortense's and Wencelas' son, Bette implies to Hortense that there have been ""rumours"" regarding Wenceslas's fidelity to her. She also encourages Cesar Cravel , a wealthy perfumer, to pursue Jenny as it is becoming known that Hulot owes huge debts to various money lenders and acquaintances. Hulot, however, is genuinely in love with Jenny and, at Bette's encouragement, challenges Cesar to a duel. Cesar shoots Hulot in the leg, but instantly regrets it and helps him with the doctor. The resulting injury leaves Hulot walking with a limp. Meanwhile with the family losing money, Bette encourages Hulot's son and Cravel's son-in-law Victorin  to go to a shady money lender in her district. But he cannot pay off the debts in time and is forced later on to flee with his family when the money lender threatens his life. The Hulot family's last hope of financial aid is the sculpture Wenceslas has created. However he is shown to be lacking in inspiration, and when the sculpture is unveiled it is only a lump of marble from which sprouts a crude arm wielding a sword. This embarrassment also loses the family a lot of money, since Hulot resolves to repay the commission that had been paid to Wenceslas. In desperation, Hortense offers herself to Cesar, as he had said earlier in the film that he would pay 200,000 francs for a glimpse of her naked. But the good-hearted Cesar says she does not need to sleep with him and tells her he will give her the money that day. On the way to the bank, Bette intercepts Cesar and convinces him to give her the money, pointing to a man in the distance across the square and saying that Wenceslas is spying on Cesar because he is jealous of his relationship with Hortense. Cesar obliges, after which we see Bette pay a street urchin a franc for posing as Wenceslas. She then goes to Wenceslas and tells him that Jenny will give him the money but warns him to beware of her. Wenceslas goes to Jenny and after a whole night in each other's company, merely talking, discovers in her a free spirit much like his own, and falls for her. Jenny reciprocates his feelings. Bette confronts Jenny about her feelings for Wenceslas and she tells her that she loves him and they are going to run away together to the country. In retaliation, Bette forges a letter from Jenny to Wenceslas telling him to meet her at a hotel. She shows the letter to Hortense, then leaves it for Hulot to find, prompting Hulot to go to the hotel believing that Jenny wants him back. Hortense and Hulot arrive at the hotel to see Jenny and Wenceslas in bed having intercourse. Shocked by the discovery, both Hulot and Hortense faint. The shock and heartbreak of Jenny's affair with Wenceslas leaves Hulot paralysed and unable to speak. Cesar visits his friend, heartbroken over his condition, and tells him the sad truth that women don't fall for men like them. Meanwhile Bette breaks a statue Wenceslas has been working on and claims Hortense did it in a fit of jealousy, prompting Wenceslas to leave with Jenny that night. Bette unsuccessfully tries to stop him, saying he belongs to her. She then goes to Hortense and convinces her to shoot Jenny and reclaim Wenceslas's love from her. Wenceslas goes to Jenny and begs her to go with him but Jenny declines, opting to stay in Paris as she cannot abandon her life as a courtesan. To spare his feelings she tells Wenceslas she does not love him anymore. Heartbroken and disgusted, Wenceslas opens the door to leave, but just at that moment Hortense arrives and shoots him as the door opens. At Wenceslas's funeral, only Bette, Jenny and Hortense are present. During the funeral the police come to arrest Hortense for the murder of her husband. Hortense begs Bette for help but Bette coldly mocks her, asking ""Whatever shall I do without you?"" in an idle, dispassionate tone of voice. At this exchange, Jenny looks at Bette, finally realising the extent of Bette's hatred for her family and how she has aided Bette in her mission to destroy them. Bette, unashamed of Jenny's realisation, leaves her with the words ""Life can be so boring, don't you think?"" repeating something Jenny had told her earlier. The film ends six months later, during the French Revolution of 1848. The family has lost most of its wealth and now Bette looks after the immobilised Hulot and Hortense's baby, whom she has named Wenceslas. She says that finally she has her own Wenceslas to love her and that one day he will be a great artist like his father. Jenny continues her life as a courtesan. The final scene shows her as one of a group of nuns singing a hymn before they all turn around and flash their naked backsides to the Burlesque theatre  audience."

Bette follows him one day after Jenny inadvertently arouses her suspicions by mentioning that Lord Hulot, who is her lover, gave her a piece of artwork that came from his future son-in-law; Bette recognizes the artwork as Wenceslas's. Furious at Wenceslas's betrayal, Bette swears revenge and enlists Jenny to help her. Bette's plan, in essence, is to turn the family members against each other. After the birth of Hortense's and Wencelas' son, Bette implies to Hortense that there have been ""rumours"" regarding Wenceslas's fidelity to her. She also encourages Cesar Cravel , a wealthy perfumer, to pursue Jenny as it is becoming known that Hulot owes huge debts to various money lenders and acquaintances. Hulot, however, is genuinely in love with Jenny and, at Bette's encouragement, challenges Cesar to a duel. Cesar shoots Hulot in the leg, but instantly regrets it and helps him with the doctor. The resulting injury leaves Hulot walking with a limp. Meanwhile with the family losing money, Bette encourages Hulot's son and Cravel's son-in-law Victorin  to go to a shady money lender in her district. But he cannot pay off the debts in time and is forced later on to flee with his family when the money lender threatens his life. The Hulot family's last hope of financial aid is the sculpture Wenceslas has created. However he is shown to be lacking in inspiration, and when the sculpture is unveiled it is only a lump of marble from which sprouts a crude arm wielding a sword. This embarrassment also loses the family a lot of money, since Hulot resolves to repay the commission that had been paid to Wenceslas. In desperation, Hortense offers herself to Cesar, as he had said earlier in the film that he would pay 200,000 francs for a glimpse of her naked. But the good-hearted Cesar says she does not need to sleep with him and tells her he will give her the money that day. On the way to the bank, Bette intercepts Cesar and convinces him to give her the money, pointing to a man in the distance across the square and saying that Wenceslas is spying on Cesar because he is jealous of his relationship with Hortense. Cesar obliges, after which we see Bette pay a street urchin a franc for posing as Wenceslas. She then goes to Wenceslas and tells him that Jenny will give him the money but warns him to beware of her. Wenceslas goes to Jenny and after a whole night in each other's company, merely talking, discovers in her a free spirit much like his own, and falls for her. Jenny reciprocates his feelings. Bette confronts Jenny about her feelings for Wenceslas and she tells her that she loves him and they are going to run away together to the country. In retaliation, Bette forges a letter from Jenny to Wenceslas telling him to meet her at a hotel. She shows the letter to Hortense, then leaves it for Hulot to find, prompting Hulot to go to the hotel believing that Jenny wants him back. Hortense and Hulot arrive at the hotel to see Jenny and Wenceslas in bed having intercourse. Shocked by the discovery, both Hulot and Hortense faint. The shock and heartbreak of Jenny's affair with Wenceslas leaves Hulot paralysed and unable to speak. Cesar visits his friend, heartbroken over his condition, and tells him the sad truth that women don't fall for men like them. Meanwhile Bette breaks a statue Wenceslas has been working on and claims Hortense did it in a fit of jealousy, prompting Wenceslas to leave with Jenny that night. Bette unsuccessfully tries to stop him, saying he belongs to her. She then goes to Hortense and convinces her to shoot Jenny and reclaim Wenceslas's love from her. Wenceslas goes to Jenny and begs her to go with him but Jenny declines, opting to stay in Paris as she cannot abandon her life as a courtesan. To spare his feelings she tells Wenceslas she does not love him anymore. Heartbroken and disgusted, Wenceslas opens the door to leave, but just at that moment Hortense arrives and shoots him as the door opens. At Wenceslas's funeral, only Bette, Jenny and Hortense are present. During the funeral the police come to arrest Hortense for the murder of her husband. Hortense begs Bette for help but Bette coldly mocks her, asking ""Whatever shall I do without you?"" in an idle, dispassionate tone of voice. At this exchange, Jenny looks at Bette, finally realising the extent of Bette's hatred for her family and how she has aided Bette in her mission to destroy them. Bette, unashamed of Jenny's realisation, leaves her with the words ""Life can be so boring, don't you think?"" repeating something Jenny had told her earlier. The film ends six months later, during the French Revolution of 1848. The family has lost most of its wealth and now Bette looks after the immobilised Hulot and Hortense's baby, whom she has named Wenceslas. She says that finally she has her own Wenceslas to love her and that one day he will be a great artist like his father. Jenny continues her life as a courtesan. The final scene shows her as one of a group of nuns singing a hymn before they all turn around and flash their naked backsides to the Burlesque theatre  audience."

However Baron Hector Hulot , her late cousin's husband, still knowingly treats her as a ""housekeeper"", giving her charge over his daughter Hortense . Refusing the offer to stay in Hulot's home, Bette returns to her apartment in a rundown poorer district of Paris, where she makes costumes for a Burlesque theatre. She becomes friends with the headliner of the show, famed courtesan Jenny Cadine .

The absence of Santa's reindeer is explained by claiming that they flew away shortly after the mishap because it was too hot for them. Apparently using telepathic powers, Santa summons local children to aid him. Most of the children's attempts to free him involve animals, including a pig, a sheep, a donkey, a horse, and an actor in a gorilla suit. Inexplicably, two boys playing Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn watch and comment on the action from a distance. When all the children's attempts fail, Santa encourages them not to give up hope, telling them the story of a girl who visits the theme park Pirates World where she hears the story of ""Thumbelina"" as an example.

Seok-i  anxiously awaits the arrival of his boyfriend Min-soo , who has taken leave from the military. Shortly after they reunite, they are met by Min-soo's mother , who is unaware of their relationship. Seok-i decides to stay with Min-soo and his mother at an inn when he realizes there is no way for him to get back home. The next day, after Min-soo's mother leaves for church, the couple become physically intimate back in their room. Their session is cut short, however, when Min-soo's mother returns unexpectedly early and becomes devastated by the revelation. Seok-i returns home that night. Then there is a short confession song by Min-soo for his mother, telling her that he is gay and that he will continue to love Seok-i. Sometime after the event, Seok-i is shown working at a restaurant when he is encountered by Min-soo, who is on leave again. As the two run outside, a voice-over of Min-soo's telephone conversation with his mother plays—Min-soo tells her that he will return home together with Seok-i.

Before they do that, they try to investigate on the heroism of the Philippine national hero. Of particular focus is his supposed retraction of his views against the Roman Catholic Church during the Spanish regime in the Philippines which he expressed primarily through his two novels Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo. The investigation was done mainly by ""interviewing"" key individuals in the life of Rizal such as his mother Teodora Alonso, his siblings Paciano, Trinidad, and Narcisa, his love interest and supposed wife Josephine Bracken, and the Jesuit priest who supposedly witnessed Rizal's retraction, Fr. Balaguer. Eventually, the two filmmakers would end up ""interviewing"" Rizal himself to get to the bottom of the issue."

Starting from its roots in 1960s antiwar and civil rights protests, the film details major developments in feminist art through the 1970s and explores how the tenacity and courage of these pioneering artists resulted in what is now widely regarded as the most significant art movement of the late 20th century. For more than forty years, filmmaker Lynn Hershman Leeson  has collected a plethora of interviews with her contemporaries—and shaped them into an intimate portrayal of their fight to break down barriers facing women both in the art world and society at large. With a score by Sleater-Kinney’s Carrie Brownstein, !W.A.R. features Miranda July, The Guerilla Girls, Yvonne Rainer, Judy Chicago, Marina Abramovic, Yoko Ono, Cindy Sherman, Barbara Kruger, B.

He sees smoke from a campfire, and goes to investigate. There he finds four escaped Denver convicts, and steals their beans and horses, after knocking one convict out with a single blow to the top of his head. When the guy awakens he has become addlepated, and that becomes a running gag throughout the film. Next, the film starts the opening credits and the title song, while we see Trinity  on his travois. He wakes up to see the campfire Bambino saw. The convicts are trying to fry more beans. Trinity pretends to be an innocent lackwit, even advising the convicts to try to snap their addlepated companion out of his state by hitting him on the head again. When this doesn't work, the convicts decide to punish the ""kid"" by just ""winging"" him, but Trinity defends himself by displaying his superior gun skills. Trinity then steals the beans and tricks them into fighting each other to see which one he doesn't shoot. He leaves them fighting. The next scene is Bambino at home taking a bath. His father sees Trinity and they both go inside. Bambino is furious to see Trinity because in the last film Trinity had given a thirty-horse herd away. Trinity takes a very quick bath and everyone goes to the table for lunch. Then the four convicts show up and try to attack Trinity and Bambino, but their mother sneaks around from the back entrance and ushers them out with a shotgun. That night, Trinity's father has some kind of an attack, and it appears he might not live long. He makes Trinity and Bambino promise to work together. When Bambino leaves the room, it is revealed that his dad was faking it. Bambino is forced to teach Trinity how to be a successful horse thief. They see a wagon with two tired mules who are not moving, and attempt to rob the passengers. But all they find instead is a family with a farting baby and a young girl Trinity falls for. The family isn't moving because a wheel broke and they can't change it because the wagon is too heavy. Trinity and Bambino end up helping the family, with Bambino doing all the heavy lifting. When Trinity and Bambino arrive in town, they head to the local saloon. Inside, Trinity, Bambino, and two cowboys play a card game with a professional card sharp named Wild Card Hendriks. Thanks to his cardsharping skills, Trinity deals everybody a potentially winning hand. However, his hand is a little bit better, so he wins, and is accused of being a cheater. Trinity and Wild Card get a drink because Wild Card says a bullet hurts less with some alcohol in your system. Bambino  keeps the other two card players from interfering. Trinity displays his extreme speed by drawing his gun, holstering it and then slaping Hendricks in the face, all before Wild Card Hendricks can react. He does this a number of times. Wild Card finally leaves unavenged. He still tries to shoot Trinity from behind, but Trinity shoots him in the hand. Trinity and Bambino buy new suits with the winnings, then run into the family they helped earlier. They lie, saying they are federal agents. Then they go into a restaurant and buy dinners, taking advantage of the deal by consuming huge quantities of food. When they leave, they meet a man who gives them four thousand dollars to ""keep their eyes shut,"" thinking they are federal agents . Then they hide on the side of the road to wait for some horses they can steal, but run into the same family as before. They have a nice little dinner with them and part ways. The two brothers travel to a town called San José. They go into a bar and start a brawl. They arrest some convicts and take them to the local sheriff for the bounty. The sheriff informs Trinity and Bambino that everyone in San José works for the man who paid them the four thousand dollars. The brothers go to the mission, only because the sheriff tells them they should not go there. There they find that the man who paid them off also uses the mission to store stolen loot. The brothers try to trick the local monks into helping him and Bambino beat the outlaws, while actually planning to take the loot for themselves. After a seven-minute long fight, a group of Rangers show up. One of them thinks he recognizes Bambino as a wanted horse thief. To allay his suspicions, Trinity gives the Ranger the stolen loot. The brothers escape and run into the family yet again, as the film ends."

Two months later, it is revealed that after being sent to jail two years ago, Doug Richardson a.k.a. ""Shivers The Clown""  was sent to a mental asylum, and Lynn Blodgett  has quit her painting career and gone on to write a book called Coulrophobia, which talks about her ""fear of clowns"" and the story about the stalking killer clown two years ago; also she and Tucker Reid have broken up and haven't seen each other for a while. But things go terribly wrong: An orderly named Ralph  helps Shivers and two other inmates escape the asylum. Shivers takes Ralph and the inmates back to his old house, which is now occupied by a junkie , who is later strangled to death by Shivers. The next day, after hearing Shiver's escape, Lynn calls Detective Peters and tells him that she will be home soon. Meanwhile, the Junkie's group of friends  arrive at the house, only to be killed by the inmates, Giggles The Clown  and Ogre The Clown . Meanwhile, Lynn arrives back home and meets Detective Peters at a restaurant, where he reveals that he's going to kill Doug Richardson. As Detective Peters takes Lynn home, they find out that Shivers has just killed Tucker outside an amusement park, where Tucker was constructing a new design for a roller coaster. Peters then calls two police officers  to guard Lynn's house before they leave at 9:00 to secluded cabins in the woods. Before they leave, Ogre kills the police officers, while Shivers tries to kill Lynn. But during the process, Shivers kills Giggles instead. Peters and Lynn escape through the cellar, while Shivers takes off in the van , leaving Ogre behind to mourn over Giggle's dead body, who was Ogre's best friend. Ogre then takes off to go after Shivers for revenge. The next day, Peters and Lynn arrive at the cabins, where they are greeted by Hot Rod , Stoltz , and Rego , who are all friends of Peters. Meanwhile, Shivers leaves Ralph in the van while he takes a leak, and Ralph calls an anonymous caller, telling him that he needs to pay him  more money if he  wants the job to be done. Then, Shivers leaves to go find Lynn, only end up at the Horner's place, killing the entire family: Old Man Horner , Mrs. Horner , Craig , Owen , and Craig and Owen's sex girlfriend Maggie . Shivers then continues to find the cabins. Meanwhile, Ralph finally escapes from his handcuffs, but Shivers took the keys with him. With no sign of a house nearby or a phone booth, Ralph continues down the road. Meanwhile back at the cabins, Lynn explains to Peters why she has coulrophobia a.k.a. ""fear of clowns"": when she was little, she and her parents got into a car accident , and while in the hospital, the hospital staff send in a clown to try to cheer her up, only to frighten her. They then see a bright light in the woods, which turns out to be Stoltz's car on fire. The guys and Peters stay behind to wait for the fire to go out while Lynn waits back at the cabins. While Lynn's outside waiting for the guys to come back, she sees Shivers behind a tree and runs off. Meanwhile, the guys head back to the cabins while Stoltz stays behind to get his stuff out of the car. Stoltz hears something behind him and takes out his gun. The person behind him is Ogre, who swings a nail bat at his head right before the screen cuts to black. As the guys head back to the cabins, they find the tires on their cars flattened and their radios' have been trashed. As they head outside to search for Lynn, Ralph pops out of nowhere and calls out to them for help, only to runoff after realizing that Peters is there, who he recognizes and knows his name. As Ralph runs off, Shivers pops out of no where and axes Ralph's head off. Ogre then comes up behind the guys and starts shooting at them with Stoltz's gun. Though the guys don't know that Ogre used Stoltz's gun, Rego goes out into the woods to get Stoltz. As he arrives to the now blown up car, Rego finds blood on the ground. Ogre comes up behind him and attacks him, only to nail him in the hand with the nail bat. Rego and Ogre start fighting each other until Shiver shows up and axes Rego in the back. Ogre, who followed Shivers to avenge Giggles's death, attacks him and the two put up a huge fight, ending with Shivers axing Ogre's head off. Meanwhile, Lynn makes it back to the cabins and meets up with Hot Rod and Peters, and they hide in the storage closet. Lynn then asks Peters how did the clowns knew where to find them. Hot Rod, knowing that they're in an awkward moment, goes outside to guard the closet. Peters explains to her that the side effects to his CJD includes a personality disorder, and it's making him want to kill Shivers. So Peters bribed Ralph to help Shivers escape, so Peters can kill Shivers once and for all. However, Ralph messed up by releasing the other two inmates, who were helping Shivers throughout the entire film. Everyone that is dead is Peter's fault, but he's gonna kill Shivers if it's the last thing he ever does. Meanwhile outside, Hot Rod hears something and goes to check it out, only to not notice Shivers on top of the roof. Shivers jumps down and axes Hot Rod in the head. Peters hears Hot Rod thud outside, and finally calls all units to come to the cabins. Peters goes outside to see if the coast is clear, only to be axed in the side. Lynn then takes off into the woods with Shivers on her tail, leaving the axe inside Peters. Peters who is still alive, reloads his gun and drags himself to where Lynn and Shivers ran off to. Peters finds them, and shoots Shivers two times: once in the hand, the other in the back, and Shivers falls into a gully. Lynn goes to check to see if Peters is okay, but then looks to see Shivers rise up out of the gully. Lynn takes Peter's gun and points it at Shivers, but before she can pull the trigger, Stoltz  pops out of nowhere and shoots Shivers three times in the chest, knocking him back into the gully. It is unknown whether if Peters is dead, or he's just simply unconscious. The police arrive, only to find out that there's no body in the gully. All that's there is a trail of blood that leads a hundred feet south, and then Shivers climbed out of the gully and went into the woods. Sgt. Raup  decides to break the news to Lynn in the morning after she gets a good night sleep. It is unknown if Shivers is alive, or he died after heading out into the woods."

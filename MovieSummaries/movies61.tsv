On his way out of the hospital, he overhears the receptionist talking about MMA while viewing the website for an upcoming underground event known as ""The Beatdown"". Talented MMA fighter Tim Newhouse  struggles to help his family when they are in debt following the death of his father. Former high school wrestler Mike Stokes  is the new kid in college and deals with issues involving his father leaving his mother for a man. Comic book store clerk Justin Epstein  is walking home when he is run down and cut by bullies. However, he is saved by Tim and his martial arts master Case Walker , who are training in a vacant lot. Mike gets kicked off the college wrestling team for starting a brawl and knocking out a teammate who made degrading comments about his father. Afterwards, he goes to see Max Cooperman , who had previously contacted him about entering the Beatdown. Outside Max's dorm room, Mike meets Zack with both taking an instant disliking to each other. As part of their tryout, they brawl for a bit and Max tells them that while they are good, they need to get better. Max proceeds to refer them to Case, who is described as being a Kyokushin karate black-belt, a former collegiate wrestler and a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu expert who was set to become a phenomenon in the MMA world years ago. They find Case at his home in an old junkyard with a makeshift gym where Tim and Justin are already training. Case is at first reluctant to train either of them, but he states that he will teach each of them differently and they must follow his orders without question. A few weeks into training, they each get into an argument over their reasons for training and deserving to be there more, the worst of it being Justin and Zack hurting each other physically, leaving them to settle it themselves. Max goes into Case's trailer and offers him the chance to make some money and at the same time, help him promote the Beatdown. Later on, Case is harassed by police officers, who threaten him for violating his probation. Because of this, the team builds a new gym where they can train and hold the Beatdown tournament. Danger strikes when Justin snaps from constant bullying, goes rogue and decides to not only attack his personal enemies but also the group itself by framing their mentor and setting him up to go to jail. The rest of the group find out what has happened to Case and decide to band together and take on Justin at the Beatdown to avenge their mentor. With each facing their own trials to reach the final match, it comes down to only one of them versus their own. Mike defeats Zack, while Justin injures Tim in the restroom - thus eliminating him from the tournament. In the tournament finals, Mike engages Justin in a grueling fight until he wins by breaking Justin's shoulders via an Omoplata submission hold. Justin attempts to retaliate by jumping Mike from behind, but Mike counters with a superman punch to the face. As Mike and his girlfriend Eve  celebrate his win, he finally calls his father and ask him to go out to dinner because they have a lot to talk about. Case gets a call from ""Big"" John McCarthy and confirms his return to MMA."

Besides the film's main plot of women ""crossing over"" to live socially as men , the opening of the film shows a scene of two male-female couples arriving noisily late at night to the hotel, but afterwards a followup scene shows that the two men had actually spent the night together in bed, with their female ""dates"" nowhere to be seen. Albert Nobbs  is a woman living as a man in order to find work in the harsh environment of 19th-century Ireland. After living as a male for thirty years, Albert, working as a hotel waiter, is known for his extreme dedication to his job, as well as for a very introverted personality. Albert has been secretly saving all his earnings to buy a tobacco shop to gain some measure of freedom and independence. Albert's steadfast focus on this is shaken by the sudden arrival of Hubert Page , a house painter hired by Mrs. Baker , the hotel owner. Albert is shocked that Hubert is to room with him while he works at the hotel. On their first night, Hubert discovers Albert's secret, but promises never to reveal it, much to Albert's relief. The next day, Hubert confesses he is also a biological woman. Hubert leaves soon after, but not before telling Albert that he has a wife named Cathleen, a dressmaker. Meanwhile, recently unemployed Joe Mackins  arrives at the hotel to repair the boiler. Flirtatious maid, Helen Dawes , is attracted to him, and they soon become lovers; Joe's controlling nature and alcoholism soon become apparent, however. Albert visits Hubert at his home and meets Cathleen . Albert tells Hubert the story of his/her life: born a bastard and raised in a convent before being kicked out after her well to do mother's death. One night, when she was fourteen, she was brutally gang raped and beaten by a group of men. Immediately afterwards, in order to to find work she hears there is a need for waiters, so she buys a suit and is hired. This is a pivotal event because she chooses to continue to work and eventually live as a man. We are never told what name she was born with -- she thinks of herself solely as ""Albert"". Believing Helen may be the ideal wife to run a shop with, Albert asks her to leave with him. Helen refuses, but Joe, believing that Albert will give Helen money that could help the pair emigrate to America, encourages Helen to lead him on. Helen agrees to be with Albert, who buys Helen expensive gifts to please her. Helen is uncomfortable with Albert and the arrangement that Joe forced her to make. Albert tells Helen he wants to buy a shop, though Helen only wants to leave Ireland for America. A typhoid epidemic has broken out in Dublin, and when some staff fall ill, customers avoid the hotel, causing financial problems. Albert becomes infected but soon recovers, while Helen discovers she is pregnant with Joe's child. Joe is terrified, fearing he will become like his abusive father. Albert goes to Hubert's home and learns that Cathleen died, devastating Hubert. As a tribute to her, Albert and Hubert don dresses Cathleen made and take a stroll on the beach. Though both at first are extremely uncomfortable, in this isolated environment, if only for a brief moment, Albert is free enough to embrace her real identity and sexuality. This is an important scene in the film for while Hubert does not identify himself as a woman, even in private, Albert is overcome with joy at finding that he is still a woman, reveling in the person who has been sublimated for so many years. But a stumble and fall brings her back to reality and she and Hubert redress as men and go back to their lives as before. Back at the hotel, Albert learns Helen is pregnant and offers to marry her. Helen refuses, sensing Albert does not love her, though Albert agrees with her fear that Joe will abandon her and the child and go to America alone. Later that evening, when Joe and Helen get into a loud fight, Albert intervenes. Albert physically attacks Joe when he attempts to hurt Helen in a fit of rage; Joe throws Albert against a wall, hitting Albert's head. Albert returns to his room, but notices that he is bleeding from one ear. He dies later that night, presumably as a result of his head injury. Mrs. Baker discovers Albert's hidden money and uses it to revitalize the hotel. In the following months, Joe has gone to America and Helen has given birth to a son, Albert Joseph. Mrs. Baker makes further use of Albert's money by hiring Hubert to paint the entire hotel. Hubert sees Helen again, who breaks down and reveals that she will be separated from her son and thrown out into the street. Hubert tells her, ""We can't let that happen, can we?"", implying that he will look after her in lieu of Albert."

The Woman is the last remaining member of a cannibalistic tribe that has roamed the northeast coast for decades (as seen in the 2009 film [[Offspring . While out hunting, Chris Cleek happens upon the Woman, who is bathing. He captures her in a net and knocks her out. He returns home with her, restrains her in a cellar, and directs his family to participate in ""civilizing"" her. Chris's kids, his son Brian and his daughter Peggy, are shown to be disturbed. Brian maliciously attacks his classmates, enjoying seeing them in pain and Peggy is withdrawn at school and wears very baggy clothes. Chris's first attempt to approach the woman results in her biting off and swallowing the end of his ring finger. Chris then orchestrates a series of violent civilizing measures. He is shown to be abusive to his wife, Belle, while Peggy is afraid of him. Chris bathes the Woman with boiling hot water and then decides to bathe her with a high-pressure power washer. Peggy, unable to stand it anymore, rushes to the Woman's aid, and turns off the power washer. That night, Chris rapes the Woman, while Brian secretly observes. Chris places a candle next to the Woman after the rape, something he did earlier with his daughter Peggy while she was being tucked in to bed, implying that he may have raped her as well. The next day, Brian comes home early from school and tortures the woman by using a pair of pliers on her nipple. When Peggy catches her brother assaulting the woman, she tells her mother, who reports the incident to Chris. Chris laughs it off, and Belle, who is usually demure, stands up to her husband's inhumanity, and announces she will take her daughters and leave, but not Brian. Chris then knocks Belle unconscious, just as Peggy's teacher Ms. Raton  rings the doorbell. Ms. Raton, suspicious about Peggy, tells Chris that she believes Peggy is pregnant. He becomes angry, believing her to have found out about the incest between him and Peggy, and hits her. He and Brian tie her hands and drag her to the barn where he keeps the dogs. Peggy protests, but Chris pushes her down and verbally assaults her. In the barn, Chris and Brian lock Ms. Raton in the dog's cage where two German Shepherds taunt her. The cage also contains an eyeless girl named ""Socket""  who behaves like the two dogs. Socket and the dogs kill and eat Ms. Raton as Chris and Brian look on, smiling. Peggy then releases the imprisoned woman from the cellar. The woman attacks Belle, gnawing off most of her face before tossing her lifeless body in the air. She then proceeds to the barn, where she attacks Brian with a lawnmower blade, severing his torso. She then rips Chris's heart out and eats it. With her mother, father, and brother dead, a terrified Peggy attempts to escape with her little sister. The woman does not attack the girls; instead, she offers her bloody finger to the youngest daughter, who licks it, and then to Peggy, who does not. The woman, Socket, acting as the woman's dog, and the young girl walk away from the house, apparently forming a new family. Peggy initially watches, but then follows them towards the woods."

He is shown to be abusive to his wife, Belle, while Peggy is afraid of him. Chris bathes the Woman with boiling hot water and then decides to bathe her with a high-pressure power washer. Peggy, unable to stand it anymore, rushes to the Woman's aid, and turns off the power washer. That night, Chris rapes the Woman, while Brian secretly observes. Chris places a candle next to the Woman after the rape, something he did earlier with his daughter Peggy while she was being tucked in to bed, implying that he may have raped her as well. The next day, Brian comes home early from school and tortures the woman by using a pair of pliers on her nipple. When Peggy catches her brother assaulting the woman, she tells her mother, who reports the incident to Chris. Chris laughs it off, and Belle, who is usually demure, stands up to her husband's inhumanity, and announces she will take her daughters and leave, but not Brian. Chris then knocks Belle unconscious, just as Peggy's teacher Ms. Raton  rings the doorbell. Ms. Raton, suspicious about Peggy, tells Chris that she believes Peggy is pregnant. He becomes angry, believing her to have found out about the incest between him and Peggy, and hits her. He and Brian tie her hands and drag her to the barn where he keeps the dogs. Peggy protests, but Chris pushes her down and verbally assaults her. In the barn, Chris and Brian lock Ms. Raton in the dog's cage where two German Shepherds taunt her. The cage also contains an eyeless girl named ""Socket""  who behaves like the two dogs. Socket and the dogs kill and eat Ms. Raton as Chris and Brian look on, smiling. Peggy then releases the imprisoned woman from the cellar. The woman attacks Belle, gnawing off most of her face before tossing her lifeless body in the air. She then proceeds to the barn, where she attacks Brian with a lawnmower blade, severing his torso. She then rips Chris's heart out and eats it. With her mother, father, and brother dead, a terrified Peggy attempts to escape with her little sister. The woman does not attack the girls; instead, she offers her bloody finger to the youngest daughter, who licks it, and then to Peggy, who does not. The woman, Socket, acting as the woman's dog, and the young girl walk away from the house, apparently forming a new family. Peggy initially watches, but then follows them towards the woods."

Girish Kasarvalli's award-winning Kanasemba Kudureyaneri  is a classic example of this. The film applies a back and forth narrative to tell the story of gravedigger Irya and his belief in Siddhas, nomads whose arrival is considered auspicious. It is believed that if the death of a person coincides with the arrival of a Siddha, the soul is sure to go to heaven. Irya and his wife are made known of their arrival through dreams. In fact for Irya, if a Siddha appears in his dream, it denotes a death in the village. However, once despite dreaming of a Siddha, Irya is told that there is no death in the village. He goes to the house of an ailing village elder, anticipating his death but is sent back by the caretaker saying all is well. As if this is not enough, a Siddha not arriving in the village despite his wife having dreamt of his arrival, crushes Irya's faith in Siddhas, whom he believes are his protectors. Is Irya an easy prey to superstitions or are scheming villagers exploiting his dreams for their own good? The film beautifully exposes the materialistic attitude of people. It leaves you wondering whether destroying one's beliefs is the only way to progress; whether there are chances of beliefs being mistaken for superstitions just because the ones who hold these beliefs are not part of the mainstream. While the first half of the film may have you raise your brows at Irya's and Rudri's dreams and faith, the second half sets out to suggest that what may look superstitious to one may be a way of life to the other. It also shows how sometimes what looks real may be unreal and vice versa, and that with faith in our beliefs, we can achieve anything. Kasarvalli's use of non-linear narrative for the first time succeeds in building the audience's curiosity. V. Manohar's music and Ramachandra Halikere's camera work complement the story.

The attack is interrupted when a meteorite falls from the sky into a nearby car, giving Sam the chance to escape. As Moses searches the wreck of the car for valuables his face is scratched by a pale, hairless, blind and eye-less dog-sized creature; the object which fell from the sky was its cocoon. Together, the gang chase and kill the creature. Hoping to gain fame and profit they take it to their acquanitance the cannabis dealer Ron  to gain advice, who lives at the top of their tower block, Wyndham Tower. Moses asks Ron and his boss, local gangster Hi-Hatz , to keep the creature in their fortified ""weed room"" while he decides how to proceed. More objects begin to fall from the sky. Eager to fight more of the creatures, the gang arm themselves and go to the nearest crash site. They find new, gorilla-sized blind aliens, these ones with spiky fur which is so black it doesn't reflect light, huge claws and multiple rows of glowing fangs. Fleeing the aliens, the gang are intercepted by the police and Moses is arrested, identified as a mugger by Sam. The aliens, following Moses, maul the police to death and attack their van, leaving Sam and Moses trapped inside. Dennis reaches the vehicle and drives the van away, only to crash the van into Hi-Hatz's car. Sam runs away while the rest of Moses' gang catch up and confront Hi-Hatz. Enraged about his car, Hi-Hatz threatens them with a gun, refusing to believe their story of aliens - until his henchman is attacked by one, allowing the gang to escape. The gang attempts to flee to Wyndham Tower but are again followed and attacked en route by the aliens, where Biggz is forced to hide in a rubbish container, and Pest gets severely bitten in the leg. They discover Sam lives in their building, force their way into her flat, and persuade her to treat Pest's leg. An infant of the furry aliens bursts in and Moses kills it with a samurai sword through the head. Sam reasons it is safer to stay with the gang than on her own and joins them. The gang moves upstairs to the flat of some neighbourhood girls believing their security gate will keep them safe. The adult furry aliens instead attack from outside, climbing up the side of the tower block, smashing through the window and they bite through Dennis' motorcycle helmet, killing him. As one alien is about to kill Moses, Sam stabs it through the head, saving him. The girls note that the aliens went straight for Moses and kick the gang out of the flat, believing them to be the focus of the creatures. In the hall, the gang is attacked by Hi-Hatz and more henchmen. The gang escapes while an alien pursues Hi-Hatz and his henchmen into a lift. Hi-Hatz kills the alien, though his henchmen perish, and continues his search for Moses. Making their way upstairs to Ron's weed room, the gang runs into more aliens, but using fireworks as distractions, they get by. Jerome, however, becomes disoriented in the smoke and is killed by an alien. Entering Ron's flat they find that Hi-Hatz is already there. Hi-Hatz prepares to shoot Moses but hordes of aliens smash through the window and tear off his face. Moses, Pest and Sam, joined by Ron's weed customer Brewis , retreat into the weed room while Ron hides in the flat. Biggz, still trapped in the bin by an awaiting adult alien, is saved by Probs and Mayhem, two unruly children, using a water-gun filled with petrol and a flame to torch the creature, since their only apparant weakness is fire. In the weed room, Brewis notices a luminescent liquid on Moses' jacket under the ultraviolet light. Brewis theorises that the aliens are like spores, drifting through space on solar winds until they chance on a suitable planet. After landing in an area with enough food, the female then lets off a strong pheromone which will attract the male creatures to it so that they can mate and propogate their species in their new world. Brewis suggests that the smaller, hairless alien which Moses killed in the beginning was such a female, and it had left a mating scent on Moses that the larger male aliens have been tracking throughout the evening. The gang form a plan for Sam, who has not been stained with the pheromone, to go to Moses' flat and turn on the gas oven. Before she leaves, Moses forces Pest to return the ring they stole from her, feeling guilty for having mugged her. Sam successfully avoids the aliens, turns on the gas and leaves the Block. Moses, with the dead female alien strapped to his back, rushes out of the weed room and into his flat, while the males converge on the scent and chase Moses through the block. Inside his flat he throws the female into the kitchen and the males follow. Using fireworks, Moses ignites the gas-filled room and leaps out the window. The explosion engulfs the flat and the aliens, but Moses survives, clinging to a Union Jack hanging from the side of the building. In the aftermath, Moses, Pest, Brewis and Ron are arrested, considered responsible for the deaths around the Block including the two policemen who had earlier arrested Moses; Sam, however, comes to their defence. In the back of the police van, Moses and Pest hear the residents of the Block cheering for Moses, causing Moses to smile for the first time."

The chancellor Zhao Dun and his son, General Zhao Shuo, have a rift with General Tu Angu. Tu secretly murders the duke with poison and pushes the blame to the Zhao family, using that as an excuse to massacre the entire Zhao clan of about 300 people. The only survivor is Zhao Shuo's baby son Zhao Wu, born to the duke's older sister Princess Zhuang. Zhuang pleads with Tu Angu's subordinate Han Jue to spare her child and commits suicide after entrusting Zhao Wu to the physician Cheng Ying, telling Cheng to bring the child to Gongsun Chujiu, a friend of the Zhao family. When Tu Angu learns that the orphan had escaped, he slashes his sword at Han Jue's face in anger, disfiguring him. Subsequently, Tu issues orders to seal the gates and to gather all newborn babies in the city. The ploy was to identify the Zhao orphan since Tu was counting on those hiding the baby to not hand him over; hence singling out the one baby left in the city to be the Zhao infant. Cheng Ying brings the baby Zhao Wu home, but alas, his wife gives up the child to the searching soldiers, claiming Zhao Wu as her own son. Cheng then asks Gongsun Chujiu to bring his wife and son  out of the city, while he stays behind to try and retrieve his real son from Tu Angu. Tu finds Cheng suspicious and Cheng lies that the Zhao orphan has been taken out of the city by Gongsun. Tu then leads his soldiers to Gongsun's house and finds Cheng's wife and son. Mistaking Cheng's son as the Zhao orphan, Tu kills the infant, Gongsun and Cheng's wife. Cheng is devastated by the loss of his family and he swears vengeance on Tu Angu. He brings Zhao Wu to Tu's house and raises the boy there. Tu misbelieves that Zhao Wu is Cheng's child and treats him like a son. Zhao Wu gradually grows up under Tu's tutelage and develops a father-son bond with Tu. Cheng Ying also forges a close friendship with the disfigured Han Jue and they secretly plot to help Zhao Wu avenge his family. One day, Cheng Ying breaks the truth to Zhao Wu, telling him that Tu Angu, who has been a fatherly figure to him for the past 15 years, is actually the murderer of his family. Zhao is unable to accept the truth initially but his attitude changes as he hears from Han Jue about how Cheng Ying sacrificed his own son to save him. Zhao and Cheng finally confront Tu Angu, but Tu is aware of Zhao's true identity, as over the years, he has noticed that the boy resembles Zhao Shuo.

He uses methods of experiencing adventures to get CEOs of businesses into selling their buildings to Popper's real estate company. When he gets home to his apartment after an unsuccessful attempt to convince his children to stay a weekend with him, he learns that his father has passed away during an adventure to Antarctica. Popper is called to his lawyer who tells him his father's last will asks for his son to be given a souvenir from his last adventure. The next week a crate containing a gentoo penguin  shows up at his doorstep. After the penguin annoys him Mr. Popper tries to send the penguin back to the crew of Captain Popper. Eventually, due to a miscommunication with a crewmember of Captain Popper on the telephone, more penguins arrive , bringing the total to six. Popper initially intends to donate the penguins to a pest control of some sort, but changes his mind when his children, Janie Popper and Billy Popper, think that the penguins are Billy's birthday present. That night Mr. Popper meets with New York Zookeeper Nat Jones, who asks Mr. Popper for the penguins, having been tipped off by Popper's assistant for a pest problem. Popper tries to stall him by asking him to collect the penguins another time. Nat Jones agrees but not before warning that the conditions in Popper's apartment are not good enough to raise penguins. Popper is forced to pay the board of his apartment to keep the penguins with him in his apartment home and lie to his arrogant neighbor Kent about there being no animals in his home. At the same time, Popper is given the task of buying Tavern on the Green, an old restaurant where he used to eat with his father as a child, with the intent of tearing it down and building a new development in its place. However, its elderly owner, Selma Van Gundy, will only sell it to someone who she deems a person of true value. Popper has two unsuccessful meetings with her, and explaining his business methods she refuses to sell it to him, leaving Popper to be rushed by his bosses to make sure the company gets the tavern. Having the penguins around helps Popper to become closer to his children. He also begins dating their mother, Amanda Popper, again, and for the first time his children are happy to stay nights with him. The penguins eventually lay three eggs. Two of the eggs hatch and one doesn’t. Popper becomes so obsessed with seeing the last egg hatch, losing his job in the process when he angers his bosses for not focusing on the tavern for them. Nat Jones sneaks in the apartment one night when becoming impatient with Popper and after an argument with Popper, warns him in frustration that penguins can only survive in the cold or zoo and vows to get the penguins sometime; as a result Popper puts snow in his apartment, and lowers his temperature for the penguins. After a few days of waiting for the egg, upon realizing from Nat Jones that the egg can’t be hatched, Popper feels he is not capable of raising the penguins and reluctantly donates them to Nat Jones for the New York zoo. He then is re-hired by his bosses, and refocuses his attention on purchasing the Tavern on the Green. His children and ex-wife, however, are disappointed in his decision, seeing it as wrong. The next day his ex-wife prepares to go to Africa for three weeks with her boyfriend Rick who takes an interest in Popper, and leave the kids in his care. When preparing for the next press conference to sell the tavern, Popper drops his keys and finds a lost letter from his father, which had been delivered with the first penguin, Captain. In it, his father tells him to hold his children close and love them, just as this penguin would love him. Having a change of heart, Popper asks his children and ex-wife to help him get the penguins back from the zoo before the press conference at the tavern and before his ex-wife goes to Africa. Popper and his family interrogate Nat Jones about the penguins, but Jones claims that the penguins were separated and traded to other zoos as planned. However, immediately after that Popper finds that Jones is lying about them having done it already, with help from the shouting penguin named Loudy. He frees the penguins from a cooler in the office and locks Jones inside when he attempts to recapture the penguins by holding up a raw fish for them. When preparing to escape, Popper and his family notice that Jones has managed to escape and security guards are looking everywhere for them. While in a gift shop, Captain is separated from the group when he gets tangled in a kite and escapes to the roof. Popper asks his assistant Pippy to create a distraction so that Popper and his family can escape. Captain falls off the roof of the gift shop, and with the help of the kite, finally gets his chance to fly. Popper and his family manage to escape with the penguins and flee to the tavern with Jones in pursuit on a golf-cart. Upon seeing how Popper had reunited his family and rescued the penguins, Van Gundy agrees to sell him the restaurant saying that her desire to know what he is worth, was a test to make sure the boy  sitting with his father at her restaurant years ago, wasn't lost. But rather than tear it and the park down as once planned, Popper orders that the restaurant be renovated and reopened. Immediately after Van Gundy makes the deal with Popper, Nat Jones arrives with the police to arrest Popper for theft of the penguins. After explaining the story in front of the crowd and police, the officers agree to spare Popper from prison if they determine by test who the penguins love. Nat Jones holds up a sardine for the penguins thinking they love fish more than Popper, but the penguins go to Popper much to Nat Jones's dismay. The crowd applauds for Popper and when Nat Jones grows hysterical about attempts to getting Popper arrested for the zoo break in, the touched police officers arrest Jones instead. While he is legally in the right, Van Gundy is able to protect Mr. Popper from arrest due to her friendship with New York's Mayor thus leaving Popper back in custody of the penguins. At the end of the film, Popper and his family travel to Antarctica with the penguins, allowing them to live with their own kind and promising to visit on occasions. Popper's first penguin, Captain, is revealed to have laid another egg. Popper tells his children that they'll have to come back and visit when the baby, who he named Bald Eagle , is born. He then concludes by saying ""Thanks Captain. You're the coolest gift I have ever gotten."""

He immediately drives to a convenience store and buys a large amount of beer. When he returns home, he finds his wife is gone, the locks have been changed, and his belongings have been strewn all over his front lawn.

In addition, his credit cards no longer work, he has been blocked from the joint checking account he has with his wife, and his phone service is terminated. When the police ask him to vacate the premises, Nick gets them to contact his AA sponsor, Detective Frank Garcia , who provides him with a permit for a yard sale, allowing him three more days before he must move on. Nick gets a neighborhood boy, Kenny , to help him sell his possessions, assuring Kenny he will pay him for the help, and also that he will teach him to play baseball. The first day's sale is unsuccessful as Nick is unwilling to let items go. Nick meets his new neighbor Samantha , and invites her to his backyard. There, he tells her that he had been sober for six months until attending a conference in Denver, during which he had gotten blackout drunk with a female coworker; he awoke with no memory of the night before, and soon learned that she had lodged a complaint against him, setting the stage for his firing. Nick then finds a yearbook with a friendly message from an old classmate, Delilah , whom he tracks down and visits. The reunion is awkward, but Delilah nevertheless gives Nick a hug and tells him that he is a good person deep down. Now completely broke, Nick has to go without alcohol and soon experiences withdrawal. Samantha gives him a Valium and tells him that he needs help. He replies that she is no better than him because she puts up with her husband's drinking and frequent absences. Samantha storms off, angry and hurt.

Nick apologizes to Samantha, who admits that he was right and that she had told her husband to come home or get a divorce. She, Nick and Kenny then go out to dinner. During dinner Nick encounters his supervisor, who explains that the incident in Denver probably did not happen since the female employee he got drunk with tried blackmailing other employees, and that Nick probably would have gotten his job back if he had not slashed the supervisor's tires.

It is the story of Durga Devi who has three sons, Ram, Laxman and Bharat . Durga Devi has said that she will bequeath all her wealth to her first grandson however her first two sons, Ram and Laxman who are both married have so far only produced daughters, due to this both the wives and their daughters are shunned from the family. In the meantime, the youngest son Bharat starts to romance Priya , a girl of poor stock who works at a telephone booth. They fall in love; however, Durga Devi objects to Bharat engaging in a relationship with an impoverished girl. To prevent Durga Devi from discovering their relationship, Bharat's father, Dashrath , provides him and Priya with two lakhs, and they subsequently marry. They live happily together until Durga Devi discovers that they have been deceiving her, and she lashes out at Dashrath and Bharat. Durga Devi fires her maid and makes the new bride, Priya do all the household chores. As time passes, Priya falls pregnant and is foretold that her child will bring great happiness in the family by Durga Devi's father. Everyone assumes that this means Priya is carrying a son as a daughter could not possibly bring happiness to the family. Durga Devi's behaviour suddenly changes towards Priya and Priya is treated like a princess as she is carrying the requisite heir. However, on a visit to the doctor, Bharat and Priya are informed that they are having a girl and not a son. They soon realise that if Durga Devi ever finds out that they are having a girl then she will once again treat Priya poorly so they decide to play along with the story that she is having a boy. At the time of Priya's delivery, Bharat's friend Mulayamchand's wife is also having a baby. Both wives go into labour together with Priya delivering a girl and Mullu's wife delivering a boy. Durga Devi suddenly collapses and ends up in the same hospital. Bharat's Father sees Bharat holding Mullu's son in his arms, mistakes him for his grandson and runs with the child to revive the ailing Durga Devi. Three days later, Durga Devi insists on taking her son home. Bharat persuades Mullu and his wife to live closer to their home and convinces Mullu and his wife to let them keep their son during the day and would be returned to them during the night and in turn they could keep their daughter during the day and would be taken back at night. The story goes on and on with the two mothers running from house to house trying to sooth their own respective child until one day they are caught by Durga Devi where she comes to the cliched realisation that she made a mistake in wanting a son and accepts her granddaughters.

Cases in the United States , Canada, India, Mexico, Paraguay, the United Kingdom and France, are explored, pointing out along the way how the corporation's collusion with governments, pressure tactics, suppression and manipulation of scientific data, and extra-legal practices aided the company's attempts at dominating global agriculture, according to the documentary. Scientists, representatives of the United States Food and Drug Administration and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, civil society representatives, victims of the company’s activities, lawyers, and politicians are interviewed.The World According to Monsanto National Film Board of Canada In March 2008, French journalist Marie-Monique Robin released the results of her three years of worldwide research into Monsanto. A book was published by La Découverte, a French editor, and a video documentary, Le Monde selon Monsanto , was released on DVD and shown on Arte, the Franco-German culture TV channel.Le monde selon Monsanto from Arte TVThe World according to Monsanto from Google Video It describes numerous controversial facts and allegations about Monsanto. Marie-Monique Robin travelled the world to meet scientists and political figures in order to investigate Monsanto's actions, controversy over GM crops, and the effects of the globalization of industrial agriculture on farmers in the developing world. Those interviewed include Shiv Chopra, a Canadian researcher who was fired by Health Canada for revealing an attempted bribe by Monsanto regarding the attempted introduction of bovine growth hormone into Canada. The author of the research met several independent scientists around the world who tried to warn the political authorities about the use of genetically modified seeds. According to Robin, most of these scientists actually lost their jobs as a consequence of their speaking out. The ""revolving door syndrome"" is also pointed out in the research as a threat to the quality and independence of the scientific conclusions about the effects of Monsanto products, especially those reached by the Food and Drug Administration. Robin travels to India, Mexico, Argentina, and Paraguay to see how Monsanto's genetically modified organisms  have affected local farmers using it for their crops. The claim is that suicide rates of farmers in India have increased as farmers are finding it harder to earn a living using more expensive Monsanto seeds that, despite claims, still require specific pesticide and fertilizer . Mexico, having banned GMOs, is trying to limit contamination and crossbreeding from subsidized U.S. GMO corn imported through the North American Free Trade Agreement  for eating. Argentinian farmers are giving up farming and moving to urban slums because they cannot compete with GM crops and are finding their farms, livestock, and children being negatively affected by pesticide runoff. Paraguay was forced to accept GMO crops as it was being imported anonymously and grown en masse, so prohibiting its export would have damaged the economy. In all cases genetic variation is reduced as a result of monocropping and ownership is increasingly concentrated. Monsanto declined to participate in the documentary.  Topics addressed include PCB chemical pollution in Anniston, Alabama, the suppression of scientific studies over the adoption of genetically modified organisms  in Scotland, and the bovine growth hormone controversy. The film makes the case for environmental degradation and declining global food security through the colonization of indigenous land races by transgenic seeds produced by Monsanto."

The claim is that suicide rates of farmers in India have increased as farmers are finding it harder to earn a living using more expensive Monsanto seeds that, despite claims, still require specific pesticide and fertilizer . Mexico, having banned GMOs, is trying to limit contamination and crossbreeding from subsidized U.S. GMO corn imported through the North American Free Trade Agreement  for eating. Argentinian farmers are giving up farming and moving to urban slums because they cannot compete with GM crops and are finding their farms, livestock, and children being negatively affected by pesticide runoff. Paraguay was forced to accept GMO crops as it was being imported anonymously and grown en masse, so prohibiting its export would have damaged the economy. In all cases genetic variation is reduced as a result of monocropping and ownership is increasingly concentrated. Monsanto declined to participate in the documentary.  Topics addressed include PCB chemical pollution in Anniston, Alabama, the suppression of scientific studies over the adoption of genetically modified organisms  in Scotland, and the bovine growth hormone controversy. The film makes the case for environmental degradation and declining global food security through the colonization of indigenous land races by transgenic seeds produced by Monsanto."

Egon breaks to the local restaurant to get back on track with the finances, unfortunately he's caught and whole gang returns to Denmark. After some time Egon is released; Kjeld and Benny are waiting for him but Egon abandons them: He has been hired by Stock Broker Holm Hansen to open a safe in Switzerland belonging to his deceased associate. Egon demands 25% of the value equivalent of the contents of the safe as payment for his work. Holm Hansen agree, but has his Swiss henchman double-cross Egon once the safe is open and leave him at the mercy of the Swiss police. Egon escapes though, and makes it back to Denmark, where he reunites with Benny and Kjeld with a new plan to exact revenge and claim his payment. The safe held the Bedford Diamonds, an extremely valuable collection of jewelry, much sought-after as an inflation-proof investment for cash and wanted by police all over the world. Holm Hansen sells the diamonds to an Arabian Oil Sheikh for 15 million dollars. Using a boat, a bus and one hundred balloons, the Gang manage to snatch the diamonds under the very nose of the Sheikh and his police escort. Egon, knowing that the diamonds cannot legally be sold, plan instead to use them to extort 50% of the 15 million from Holm Hansen, but is foiled by Yvonne, who has hidden the diamonds and replaced them with worthless souvenirs. Holm Hansen concludes that Egon is raving mad, but far too knowledgeable about his businesses and orders his henchman ""Bøffen"" to make Egon ""disappear and stay gone forever"".

Realizing he has been played, Holm Hansen calls the real police, which promptly arrest him on finding the Bedford Diamonds in his possession. The Gang subsequently escapes to Majorca with the money."

The residents have been terrified into submission, and the local Sheriff Gordon Cole  hasn't been the same since the gang raped and murdered his fiancée Bridget for trying to bring evidence of their crimes to the FBI. Tormented by grief and alcoholism, he no longer has the will to stand against them. Things look bleak until one day, a mysterious young woman dressed in black leather  rides into town on a motorcycle and promptly starts killing members of Angel's gang. When Cole attempts to question her about the killings, he notices she bears a striking resemblance to his fiancée and is instantly attracted to her, much to the chagrin of local shopkeeper Sally Womack , who has wanted Cole for herself ever since Bridget's demise. Fearing retaliation from Angel  for the deaths of his men, Sally implores Cole to arrest the woman, but feeling that she is essentially performing a service by eliminating the gang members, he refuses to take any action against her. Undeterred, Sally enlists the help of Cole's corrupt Deputy Steve Stowe  and the Mayor of Lakeview  to capture her, but their plan ultimately backfires resulting in Stowe's death. Meanwhile the woman, a skilled hand-to-hand combatant, continues to eliminate the bikers one by one as she awaits Angel's return. During her time in Lakeview, the woman gets acquainted with several of the townspeople, most notably Bridget's younger sister Gordet , who has been living as a vagrant ever since witnessing her sister's brutal death. After hearing her story, the woman takes the emotionally shattered girl under her wing and tries to help her reclaim her life. Eventually Cole becomes romantically involved with the woman, but is unable to learn anything about her origin. She is undoubtedly the mirror image of his fiancée Bridget, but if the two are related, the woman gives no indication. However, when the subject of Angel is brought up, she angrily admonishes Cole for his inaction, causing him to storm off in a rage. When he tries to confess his love to her, she cryptically responds that he's ""in love with a ghost"". With Angel's return imminent, the residents of Lakeview begin a full-scale evacuation. Though Sally tries to convince Cole to leave with her, he chooses to stay behind and help the woman defend the town. With Gordet acting as a lookout, Cole and the woman are able to work together to dispatch the few remaining members of Angel's gang. Finally, the woman meets Angel face to face on the street, where they fight to the death.

Edgar Hoover  in his office during his later years. He asks that a writer  be let in, so that he may tell the story of the origin of the FBI for the sake of the public. Hoover explains that the story begins in 1919, when A. Mitchell Palmer was Attorney General and Hoover's boss at the Justice Department. Palmer suffers an assassination attempt, but is unharmed when the bomb explodes earlier than intended. Hoover recalls that the police handling of the crime scene was primitive, and that it was that night that he recognized the importance of criminal science. Later, Hoover visits his mother , and tells her that Palmer has put him in charge of a new anti-radical division, and that he has already begun compiling a list of suspected radicals. He leaves to meet Helen Gandy , who has just started as a secretary at the Justice Department. Hoover takes Gandy to the Library of Congress, and shows her the card catalog system he devised. He muses about how easy it would be to solve crimes if every citizen were as easily identifiable as the books in the library. When Hoover attempts to kiss her, she recoils. Hoover gets down on his knees and asks her to marry him, citing her organization and education, but his request is once again denied. However, Gandy agrees to become his personal secretary. Despite his close monitoring of suspected foreign radicals, Hoover finds that the Department of Labor refuses to deport anyone without clear evidence of a crime; however, Anthony Caminetti the commissioner general of immigration dislikes the prominent anarchist Emma Goldman. Hoover arranges to discredit her marriage and make her eligible for deportation, setting a precedent of deportation for radical conspiracy. After several Justice Department raids of suspected radical groups, many leading to deportation, Palmer loses his job as Attorney General. Under a subsequent Attorney General, Harlan F. Stone, Hoover is made director of the Justice Department's Bureau of Investigation. He is introduced to Clyde Tolson , a recently graduated lawyer, and takes his business card. Later, while reviewing job applications with Helen Gandy, Hoover asks if Tolson had applied. Gandy says he had, and Hoover interviews and hires Tolson. The Bureau pursues a string of gangster and bank robbery crimes across the Midwest, including the high profile John Dillinger, with general success. When the Lindbergh kidnapping captures national attention, President Hoover asks the Bureau to investigate. Hoover employs several novel techniques, including the monitoring of registration numbers on ransom bills, and expert analysis of the kidnapper's handwriting. The birth of the FBI Crime Lab is seen as a product of Hoover's determination to analyze the homemade wooden ladder left at the crime scene. When the monitored bills begin showing up in New York City, the investigators find a filling station attendant who wrote down the license plate number of the man who gave him the bill. This leads to the arrest, and eventual conviction, of Bruno Hauptmann for the kidnapping and murder of the Lindbergh child. After going to a Shirley Temple movie with Hoover's mother, Hoover and Tolson decide to go out to a club. When Ginger Rogers asks Hoover if he ever wishes he had someone to keep him warm at night, he responds that he has dedicated his life to the bureau. Ginger's mother asks Hoover to dance and he becomes agitated, saying that he and Tolson must leave, as they have a lot of work to do in the morning. When he gets home he shares his dislike of dancing with girls with his mother, and she tells him she would rather have a dead son than a ""daffodil"" for a son. She then insists on teaching him to dance, and they dance in her bedroom. Soon after, Hoover and Tolson go on a vacation to the horse races. That evening, Hoover tells Tolson that he cares deeply for him, and Tolson returns the feeling by stating that he loves Hoover. However, Hoover claims to be considering marriage to a young woman twenty years his junior, Dorothy Lamour, he has been seeing in New York City, provoking outrage from Tolson. Tolson accuses Hoover making a fool out of him and then begins throwing insults at Hoover, and consequently they begin throwing punches at each other and cause grave damage to the hotel room in the process; they eventually end up fighting on the floor. The fight ends when Tolson gets an upper hand over Hoover, and suddenly kisses him. Hoover demands that it must never happen again; Tolson says that it won't, and attempts to leave.

Edgar Hoover  in his office during his later years. He asks that a writer  be let in, so that he may tell the story of the origin of the FBI for the sake of the public. Hoover explains that the story begins in 1919, when A. Mitchell Palmer was Attorney General and Hoover's boss at the Justice Department. Palmer suffers an assassination attempt, but is unharmed when the bomb explodes earlier than intended. Hoover recalls that the police handling of the crime scene was primitive, and that it was that night that he recognized the importance of criminal science. Later, Hoover visits his mother , and tells her that Palmer has put him in charge of a new anti-radical division, and that he has already begun compiling a list of suspected radicals. He leaves to meet Helen Gandy , who has just started as a secretary at the Justice Department. Hoover takes Gandy to the Library of Congress, and shows her the card catalog system he devised. He muses about how easy it would be to solve crimes if every citizen were as easily identifiable as the books in the library. When Hoover attempts to kiss her, she recoils. Hoover gets down on his knees and asks her to marry him, citing her organization and education, but his request is once again denied. However, Gandy agrees to become his personal secretary. Despite his close monitoring of suspected foreign radicals, Hoover finds that the Department of Labor refuses to deport anyone without clear evidence of a crime; however, Anthony Caminetti the commissioner general of immigration dislikes the prominent anarchist Emma Goldman. Hoover arranges to discredit her marriage and make her eligible for deportation, setting a precedent of deportation for radical conspiracy. After several Justice Department raids of suspected radical groups, many leading to deportation, Palmer loses his job as Attorney General. Under a subsequent Attorney General, Harlan F. Stone, Hoover is made director of the Justice Department's Bureau of Investigation. He is introduced to Clyde Tolson , a recently graduated lawyer, and takes his business card. Later, while reviewing job applications with Helen Gandy, Hoover asks if Tolson had applied. Gandy says he had, and Hoover interviews and hires Tolson. The Bureau pursues a string of gangster and bank robbery crimes across the Midwest, including the high profile John Dillinger, with general success. When the Lindbergh kidnapping captures national attention, President Hoover asks the Bureau to investigate. Hoover employs several novel techniques, including the monitoring of registration numbers on ransom bills, and expert analysis of the kidnapper's handwriting. The birth of the FBI Crime Lab is seen as a product of Hoover's determination to analyze the homemade wooden ladder left at the crime scene. When the monitored bills begin showing up in New York City, the investigators find a filling station attendant who wrote down the license plate number of the man who gave him the bill. This leads to the arrest, and eventual conviction, of Bruno Hauptmann for the kidnapping and murder of the Lindbergh child. After going to a Shirley Temple movie with Hoover's mother, Hoover and Tolson decide to go out to a club. When Ginger Rogers asks Hoover if he ever wishes he had someone to keep him warm at night, he responds that he has dedicated his life to the bureau. Ginger's mother asks Hoover to dance and he becomes agitated, saying that he and Tolson must leave, as they have a lot of work to do in the morning. When he gets home he shares his dislike of dancing with girls with his mother, and she tells him she would rather have a dead son than a ""daffodil"" for a son. She then insists on teaching him to dance, and they dance in her bedroom. Soon after, Hoover and Tolson go on a vacation to the horse races. That evening, Hoover tells Tolson that he cares deeply for him, and Tolson returns the feeling by stating that he loves Hoover. However, Hoover claims to be considering marriage to a young woman twenty years his junior, Dorothy Lamour, he has been seeing in New York City, provoking outrage from Tolson. Tolson accuses Hoover making a fool out of him and then begins throwing insults at Hoover, and consequently they begin throwing punches at each other and cause grave damage to the hotel room in the process; they eventually end up fighting on the floor. The fight ends when Tolson gets an upper hand over Hoover, and suddenly kisses him. Hoover demands that it must never happen again; Tolson says that it won't, and attempts to leave.

Yavarki and Vishaka loved each other, but he left her to worship and pray to Devraj Indra for 10 years, and on his return found her married to Parvasu. Yavakree was being hailed in the entire kingdom as a saint. Nittilai used to mock Yavakri saying if he is so wise, can he predict his own death. Nittilai and Arvasu spend their day playing and dancing in their Uncle ashram. The same day, Vishakha is returning with water from well, she is confronted by yavakree, who advances towards her. She at first refuses him but ultimatley gives up and they start making out in the woods. Nittilai and Aravasu see them. Aravasu tells Vishakha to go home, while he carries her pale of water.

Yavakri, wanting to prove his strength enchants a pale of water and waits for the demon to arrive. Vishakha warns him and tells him to flee to his father's ashram, which shall force Raibhya to immolate himself. Yavakree refuses and begins to meditate. Vishakha suddenly throws the enchanted water on the ground and viciously tells Yavakree that he can now save himself only by running to his father's ashram. Seeing the demon approaching, Yavakree runs to his father's ashram. His father who is blind, is unable to recognize his panicked son and pushes him away from the premises.

On his way he is met by the demon, who calls him brother and then later tells him how he is a cursed soul seeking salvation, Paravasu rudely ignores him.

Without any questions, he soon left the office to search the employee Sidorov. On a traffic, he walked instead on streets through sewer. He then arrived a wall, which was destroyed soon by a construction machine. There he met a builder and touched his shoulders. The builder turned to him and Kozyavin asked him, but he didn't hear anything he said close his ears. The builder took a little red flag from his suit and waved with it, until every builder stopped to work, and even the machines. Kozyavin asked one more time, if he sawed Sidorov. After a surprising action, he walked further to search Sidorov. An active ramp in the building site, which workedintermittently up and down, didn't frighten up Kozyavin. Without taking any break, Kozyavin continued to walk. On a fair, he walked upon a pole. The children, which were amazed about his acrobatic skills, were asked by Kozyavin. After no reaction by them, the employee Kozyavin pursued his way with a optimistic view to comply the task. The second person Kozyavin met was a violinist, which currently played a composition. Kozyavin asked the violinist, if he saw Sidorov. Without any response, Kozyavin nudged him and took his violin bow. Walking on surrealistic stairs, he opened the door to a commission building. Kozyavin sparked a light and went through paintings and antique and finally saw two people, which looked like thieves. Kozyavin was oblivious, that they were going to swipe the whole items in this building. However, Kozyavin touched one of the man's shoulder and asked the same question said before. Surprised, they attended with Kozyavin by giving the alleged right turn to Sidorov. Early next day he pursued the same direction. He entered a pipeline on ground, which curves were unrealistically smoothed by Kozyavin himself. He jumped from the pipeline onto the ground and treaded a drought veld. Convinced to meet with Sidorov, Kozyavin went throughout the veld, until he climbed up to a mountain. With a good sight, he watched everything around him. Unfortunately he didn't find anyone and continued to move forward. He arrived a desert and got a view to a giant skeleton of a prehistoric animal. Walking through the backbone like a stair, he sawed an archaeologist, who currently researched the skeleton, and asked him the common question. With no reply and no regret about the destroyed skeleton by the archaeologist, Kozyavin continued walking. A body of stagnant water didn't block him to accomplish the task the boss gave him, so Kozyavin swam, until he reached the Antarctica. Kozyavin walked around the world, until he arrived his office. Kozyavin didn't accomplish his boss' accomplishment to find Sidorov. Kozyavin answered it with a shrug and went back to his working room.

She is trained by an older lady, Mrs. Wilson. The last patient that Mrs. Wilson and Lucy go to visit lives in an old mansion outside of civilization. Lucy enters the mansion, which is filled with stuffed animals, and finds Mrs. Wilson at the bed of the woman to whom she is attending, Mrs. Deborah Jessel. Mrs. Wilson informs her that Jessel was once a prominent ballet teacher, but is now bedridden and in a coma. Legend has it that Mrs. Jessel has a treasure of gold and jewels located somewhere on the property. After her first day on the job, Lucy meets her boyfriend, Will, and tells him of the treasure at Jessel's house. Lucy, Will, and their friend Ben all decide to hunt for the treasure. The three enter into the basement of the house through a window. After searching and finding a room filled with stuffed animals creepily gathered around a tea table, they find a single locked door. Lucy suspects that the key that was hanging around Jessel's neck is the key to this door. Inside the room, they find a white sheet covering what looks like a stuffed girl. Lucy suggests that this is the corpse of Jessel's deaf daughter Anna, still dressed in a ballerina outfit. Lucy twists the key on the pedestal the corpse is standing on, and the corpse starts spinning slowly with music playing, like a ballerina on a music box. They suddenly hear noises from the room upstairs and start to run out of the house, but find the basement window they entered from mysteriously covered by iron bars. Will tries to break a window open to escape, but the three of them get separated. Ben finds himself from an operating room with no door, with no idea how he got there, and is killed by girls wearing veils and ballet outfits appearing out of nowhere. Lucy sees Mrs. Jessel sitting at what was once Anna's tea party table. There is a flashback, showing that when Mrs Jessel was teaching ballet, she was a a very strict ballet teacher. When one girl leaves the ballet class, Jessel finds her dead in Anna's room. Anna had been drinking her blood. It is revealed that the Jessels are vampires. Will, still trying to open a window, is then attacked by Ben, who tries to bite him. He manages to stab Ben with a pair of scissors, but is attacked and killed by Mrs. Jessel. Lucy discovers that Anna is not in fact dead. Anna attempts to drink Lucy's blood but Lucy pushes her off. Suddenly Mrs. Wilson appears, punches and sedates Lucy. With Wilson looking on, Mrs. Jessel implants the pupae of a moth into the sedated Lucy and into the neck of Anna--a ritual to exchange the souls of the two. When Lucy comes to, Jessel believes that she has put Anna's soul into Lucy's body, as the color of the eyes has shifted. Jessel orders Lucy to dance. When she doesn't do as Jessel says, Wilson comes over to punish her, but Anna stabs her with scissors. She then stabs Jessel with the scissors, and both women fall to the floor. Jessel, though bleeding heavily, manages to get up and try to bite Lucy. Anna whips her mother until she releases Lucy, and the two girls throw Jessel off the third floor balcony. The next morning, Anna and Lucy escape the mansion and walk to the cliffs along the ocean side, holding hands. They unclasp their hands and Anna leans off a cliff. She does not go down into the water, rather, she flies into the sky as if to demonstrate a newfound peace. Her vampiric burn scars disappear as Lucy watches her float away.

Lucy twists the key on the pedestal the corpse is standing on, and the corpse starts spinning slowly with music playing, like a ballerina on a music box. They suddenly hear noises from the room upstairs and start to run out of the house, but find the basement window they entered from mysteriously covered by iron bars. Will tries to break a window open to escape, but the three of them get separated. Ben finds himself from an operating room with no door, with no idea how he got there, and is killed by girls wearing veils and ballet outfits appearing out of nowhere. Lucy sees Mrs. Jessel sitting at what was once Anna's tea party table. There is a flashback, showing that when Mrs Jessel was teaching ballet, she was a a very strict ballet teacher. When one girl leaves the ballet class, Jessel finds her dead in Anna's room. Anna had been drinking her blood. It is revealed that the Jessels are vampires. Will, still trying to open a window, is then attacked by Ben, who tries to bite him. He manages to stab Ben with a pair of scissors, but is attacked and killed by Mrs. Jessel. Lucy discovers that Anna is not in fact dead. Anna attempts to drink Lucy's blood but Lucy pushes her off. Suddenly Mrs. Wilson appears, punches and sedates Lucy. With Wilson looking on, Mrs. Jessel implants the pupae of a moth into the sedated Lucy and into the neck of Anna--a ritual to exchange the souls of the two. When Lucy comes to, Jessel believes that she has put Anna's soul into Lucy's body, as the color of the eyes has shifted. Jessel orders Lucy to dance. When she doesn't do as Jessel says, Wilson comes over to punish her, but Anna stabs her with scissors. She then stabs Jessel with the scissors, and both women fall to the floor. Jessel, though bleeding heavily, manages to get up and try to bite Lucy. Anna whips her mother until she releases Lucy, and the two girls throw Jessel off the third floor balcony. The next morning, Anna and Lucy escape the mansion and walk to the cliffs along the ocean side, holding hands. They unclasp their hands and Anna leans off a cliff. She does not go down into the water, rather, she flies into the sky as if to demonstrate a newfound peace. Her vampiric burn scars disappear as Lucy watches her float away.

Noticing the man's determination to divorce his wife, Gavin decides to tell him the story of one of his clients, a personal friend of his. Oliver Rose , a student at Harvard Law School, meets Barbara  at an auction, where they bid on the same antique. Oliver chats Barbara up and they become friends. When Barbara misses her ferry home, the two end up spending the night together. Eventually the two marry and have two children. Over the years, the Roses grow richer, and Barbara finds an old mansion whose owner has recently died, purchases it and devotes her time to making a home there. However, cracks seem to be forming in the family. As Oliver becomes a successful partner in his law firm, Barbara, who was a doting and loving wife early in the marriage, appears to grow restless in her life with Oliver, and begins to dislike him immensely. Oliver, for his part, cannot understand what he has done to earn Barbara's contempt, despite his controlling, self-centered, and generally dismissive behavior toward her. When Oliver believes he is suffering a heart attack,  the day after an argument, Barbara  realizes she felt a sense of relief that he might be dead. She tells him so, adding that she no longer loves him and wants a divorce. Oliver accepts, but tension arises between the two when it becomes clear that Barbara wants the house and everything in it, and when her lawyer uses Oliver's final love note to her  as leverage against him in their legal battle. Barbara initially throws Oliver out of the house, but he moves back in after discovering a loophole that allows him to stay. As a result, Barbara immediately begins plotting to remove Oliver herself, even trying to seduce Oliver's lawyer Gavin into siding with her instead. In an effort to win the house, Oliver offers his wife a considerable sum of cash in exchange for the house, but Barbara still refuses to settle. Realizing that his client is in a no-win situation, Gavin advises Oliver to leave Barbara and start a new life for himself. In return, Oliver fires Gavin and takes matters into his own hands. At this point, Oliver and Barbara begin spiting and humiliating each other in every way possible, even in front of friends and potential business clients. Both begin destroying the house furnishings; the stove, furniture, Staffordshire ornaments, and plates. Another fight results in a battle where Barbara nearly kills Oliver by using her monster truck to ram Oliver's antique automobile. In addition, Oliver accidentally runs over Barbara's cat in the driveway with his car. When Barbara finds out, she retaliates by trapping him inside his in-house sauna, where he nearly succumbs to heatstroke and dehydration. While the kids are away at college, Oliver eventually calms down and attempts to make peace with Barbara over an elegant dinner, but reaches his breaking point when Barbara serves him a paté which she implies was made from his dog . Oliver attacks Barbara, who flees into the attic. Oliver boards up the house to prevent Barbara from escaping, while Barbara loosens the chandelier to drop on Oliver in yet another attempt to kill him. When their live-in housekeeper Susan returns home in the middle of the climactic battle, she senses something is terribly wrong and discreetly contacts Gavin for help. By the time Gavin arrives, Oliver and Barbara's quarrel has culminated in the two hanging dangerously from the unsecured chandelier. During this time, Oliver admits to Barbara that despite their hardships, he always loved her, but Barbara does not respond. Before Gavin can come inside with a ladder, the combined weight of Barbara, Oliver and the chandelier is too much for the support cable, which snaps and sends them crashing violently to the floor. In his final breaths, Oliver reaches out to touch Barbara's shoulder, but Barbara uses her last ounce of strength to knock his hand away, firmly asserting her feelings for him even in death. Finishing his story, Gavin presents his client with two options: either proceed with the divorce and face a horrific bloodbath in court, or go home to his wife to settle their differences properly. The client chooses the latter, and Gavin, satisfied, calls his wife and closes up shop to go home.

In a reckless, celebratory moment, she drinks with friends and drives home intoxicated. Listening to a story on the radio about a planet that looks just like Earth, she gazes out her car window at the stars and inadvertently hits a stopped car at an intersection, putting John Burroughs  in a coma and killing his wife and son. Rhoda is a minor, so her identity is not revealed to John. After serving her prison sentence, Rhoda, after 4 years of isolation, continues to shield herself from the world outside, becoming a janitor at a local school, wanting to work ""physically,"" almost as a means to struggle past the potential she has squandered with the decision of a single night. After cleaning her former high school for a while and hearing more news stories about the mirror Earth, Rhoda visits John's house after he has recovered, thinking she will apologize for the harm she did to him. He answers the door and she loses her nerve. Instead, she pretends to be a maid offering a free day of cleaning as a marketing tool for Maid in Haven . John, who has dropped out of his Yale music faculty position and is now living in a depressed and dirty stupor, agrees to Rhoda's offer. When she finishes, John, who still does not know she is the person who killed his wife and son, asks her to come back next week. Rhoda tells him someone will come, but it may not be her. Rhoda returns to clean and develops a caring relationship with John that eventually becomes more significant and romantic. They like each other and are intelligent and compatible conversationally. Rhoda genuinely wants to be of service to him. Rhoda enters an essay contest sponsored by a millionaire entrepreneur who is offering a civilian space flight to the mirror Earth. Rhoda's essay is selected and she is chosen to be one of the first explorers to travel to the other Earth. Rhoda tells John she has won the space flight, but he asks her not to go. However, when she tells him that she was the one who killed his wife and son, he forces her out of his house. Rhoda hears in a telecast a scientist postulating that the citizens of the mirror Earth might be identical to those on her Earth in every way until the moment they learned of the others' existence. From that point on, the identical people on the different Earths probably began to deviate in small ways, changing their actions. Rhoda hopes her identical self on the other Earth did not make the mistakes she made on the night of the accident. Rhoda returns to John's house and leaves him the ticket to the other Earth, telling him enough information to give him a small hope that his wife and son might be alive on that planet. John accepts the gift and becomes one of the first civilian space travelers to the other Earth. Four months later, Rhoda looks up at the sky where Earth 2 is now hidden in fog. She approaches her back door and sees her twin from Earth 2 standing in front of her."

The extracts are from four pieces: Le sacre du printemps , Café Müller, Kontakthof, and Vollmond. These are complemented with interviews and further dance choreographies, which were shot in and around Wuppertal, Germany; the film includes scenes showing the Wuppertal Schwebebahn, an elevated railway, and some dances sequences take place inside its carriages. In the first piece, Le sacre du printemps, (Frühlingsopfer, The Rite of Spring , the dancers of the Tanztheater Wuppertal, separated into male and female groups, move about a stage covered by a thick layer of peat. The following section, Café Müller , portrays a café Pina often visited when she was a child.{{fact}} In a simple setting consisting of some tables and chairs and doors, a small woman dressed in white is entering the café. Two more women, one of whom is obviously blind, appear. They hesitate to step further, as the tables and chairs are obstructing their way. Two men come around and try to remove these barriers. Eventually the blind woman and one of the men stand face to face. The second woman wraps her arms around the other men, but she slips. This part repeats and seems to remain in a loop. The next piece, Kontakthof,  was performed multiple times for Wenders' cameras, with groups of different generations: teenagers, middle-aged dancers, and dancers over 65 (Bausch had choreographed these three variants, as Kontakthof – Mit Teenagern ab 14 , Kontakthof , and Kontakthof – Mit Damen und Herren ab 65 . The film edits these performances into one, cutting between different performers to highlight their different abilities. In the final piece, Vollmond,   the stage is flooded. The scenery consists of one large rock and some chairs. At the end of the film, the actors face the audience on a small path with a brown coal mining region in the background to an open end.

The three Imagin see a boy and jump into him to escape into time before the DenLiner suddenly appears. Kotaro Nogami and Teddy emerge from the train to pinpoint the Mole Imagin's destination to be November 11, 1971, confused on how the boy's memories exceed that far in time. When Ankh demands answers, Teddy explains who he and Eiji Hino are to Kotaro, who then introduces himself while explaining their mission to deal with the rogue Imagin who would disrupt the flow of time. Ankh has Eiji join him in getting on the DenLiner as it goes back in time, warned by the DenLiner's Owner to stay on the train so not to disrupt time. Once at 1971, as Kamen Rider New Den-O eliminates two of the Mole Imagin with the third one still on the run, Ankh manages to leave Shingo's body to get out of the DenLiner to enact his plan to steal the Core Medals from the other Greeed while they are still sealed. Realizing this, Eiji goes after Ankh before they run into the Mole Imagin as New Den-O destroys him. The Taros manage in capturing Ankh before taking him and Eiji back to the present. However, as the DenLiner departs, it turned out that one of Ankh's Cell Medals was dislodged from the Mole Imagin's death and was found by a Shocker Combatman as he presents it to General Black. The DenLiner arrives in the present to drop Eiji and Ankh off, with the latter feeling that something is off. The two then meet the boy from before, Naoki, as he and his friend, Mitsuru, tried to steal Eiji's underwear. Though Ankh saw through it, he realized they stole his O-Medal Case and chases the boys down to the slums where the case is passed on to other children. The chase is disrupted by the police, who reveal themselves as members of Shocker as they try to arrest Eiji and Ankh. After escaping from the police and meeting at the Snack Amigo, where the Cous Coussier is supposed to be, Eiji finds the kids from before. Confused about this ""Shocker"" group everyone mentions, Ankh arrives and explains to Eiji that he researched Shocker and learned that they are a terrorist organization who managed to gain control over Japan. Soon after, as Ankh holds one of the kids hostage to get the Core Medals back while Eiji manages to calm everyone down before, an announcement starts that Shocker has been inducted into the United Nations and has incorporated the various organizations  to begin their world domination plan and mass extermination of all remaining normal humans. When the Shocker Police arrive, Eiji, Ankh and the children run for it before Shigeru is held hostage. With Mitsuru and Naoki abandoning Shigeru as their only choice, Eiji refuses to leave the boy to die as he becomes Kamen Rider OOO to battle the monsters and cover the boys' escape. However, Shocker's elite soldiers, Kamen Riders 1 and 2, arrive and proceed to beat him. Though Mitsuru is reluctant, the boys give Kamen Rider OOO back the Medal Case. Kamen Rider OOO changes into Latorartar Combo to blind them so he can rush the children to safety. However, they are ambushed by General Shadow as he proceeds to defeat Kamen Rider OOO. Fortunately, the DenLiner arrives and picks Eiji and the children. Eiji learns from Teddy that Shocker found a Core Medal in 1971 and modified it for their use. Though the created Shocker Medal was powerless on its own, the Cell Medal Ankh left behind enabled Shocker to create the Shocker Greeed, which swiftly defeated the first Kamen Riders so they would become Shocker members as originally intended. This act in turn negates the existence of all Kamen Riders after the first Kamen Riders and allowed Shocker to continue its evil. Though Eiji offers to help, Kotaro tells him that he will correct the timeline, leaving him and Shigeru in the slums where they meet the Hina Izumi of this timeline. Finding Mitsuru and Naoki still on the train, the gang finds Ankh as well, putting a lease on him so Momotaros would make sure the Greeed would not mess up time any further. Arriving one minute before their previous arrival, hiding until the events unfold, Kotaro recovers the Cell Medal. However, upon attempting to reclaim his Cell Medal, Ankh to causes four Cell Medals to fly out the window with the everyone jumping out. Though Urataros, Kintaros, and Ryutaros managed to destroy three, the last one is found by a girl named Nokko, who mistakes Kotaro, Momotaros, Teddy, and Ankh as Shocker agents. She proceeds to her fellow Kamen Rider Scouts before the Cell Medal drops from her hands and is picked up by a Shocker Combatman who hands it over to General Black. Refusing to let history repeat itself, Kotaro becomes New Den-O as he and Momotaros battle the Shocker platoon while Mitsuru and Naoki run off with the Kamen Rider Scouts covering them as they and Naoki make it to a warehouse. They are attacked by Shocker's Inhumanoids before Kamen Riders 1 and 2 arrive to cover the kids' escape while they take out the Shocker soldiers. At that time, General Black transforms into the Inhumanoid Hiruchameleon to overpower New Den-O and Momotaros until the first Kamen Riders and the children trick Hiruchameleon into taking a fake Cell Medal with a transmitter so they can locate Shocker's headquarters and take out the organization's leader. Before they proceed, New Den-O destroys the real Cell Medal to prevent any further trouble. However, once there, the Double Riders, New Den-O, and Momotaros realize that they have fallen into a trap as General Black reveals that the Cell Medal that Kotaro stole was a fake as the Great Leader creates the Shocker Greeed. General Black then calls out Ikadevil, Garagaranda, and other revived kaijin before changing into Hiruchameleon and battling the Riders. As New Den-O and Momotaros have their hands full with the Shocker Greeed, the Double Riders dispose of the revived kaijin and unmask the Great Leader. Outside, Turtle Bazooka fires at the DenLiner, forcing the Owner to order a retreat. The Double Riders tell Kotaro, Momotaros, and the boys to jump onboard while they cover their escape. Still wanting to help the Double Riders, Naoki jumps off the heavily damaged DenLiner with Teddy following him before it heads back in time. On April 2, 2011, as the damaged DenLiner returns, Shocker initiates its mass extermination as Kamen Rider OOO fights them off before seeing the train. Assuming Tajadol Combo, Kamen Rider OOO takes Mitsuru to safety as Kotaro, Momotaros, and Ankh jump out of the train as it explodes. Losing his OOO Driver in the explosion, Eiji realizes that the DenLiner crew have failed in their mission and the train's destruction means the event cannot be undone. Soon after, Eiji and Kotaro are captured as Ankh and Momotaros  cover everyone's escape. Arriving at the kids' spare hideout, the group soon find Teddy in his Macheteddy form as a grave marker along with a time capsule. Other than the Kamen Rider Scouts' uniforms and Core Medals, there is a letter from Naoki which details how he and the Kamen Rider Scouts became fugitives with Teddy sacrificing himself so they would escape. Surrounded by Shocker soldiers, Momotaros takes over Shingo's body and uses the Macheteddy to keep them busy while Hina and the children run off with the OOO Driver. However, M-Ankh is captured as well and is taken with Eiji and Kotaro for public execution. However, with his group wearing the Kamen Rider Scout uniforms, Shigeru attempts to deliver the OOO Driver back to Eiji. By then, the Double Riders appear and reveal that a Shocker scientist has recently released them from their brainwashing, and they pretended to still be under Shocker's control until they crossed paths with the Shocker Greeed again. This turns into a revolt among the human audience as Eiji, Kotaro, and M-Ankh are freed. Receiving his OOO Driver from a mysterious man in white, Eiji changes into Kamen Rider OOO while Kotaro becomes New Den-O with the Momotaken sword. Though the four Kamen Riders are outnumbered at first, the playing field is changed with the sudden appearance of Kamen Riders V3, Riderman, X, Amazon, Stronger, Skyrider, Super-1, ZX, Black, and Black RX. General Black demands the meaning of this as the Owner reveals that while the Kamen Riders were erased from time, they cannot be erased from the human heart. Soon, the DenLiner arrives with Kamen Riders Shin, ZO, J, Kuuga, Agito, Ryuki, Faiz, Blade, Hibiki, Kabuto, Kiva, and Decade. As Shotaro and Philip arrive to join the fight as Kamen Rider Double, Teddy appears with Momotaros tagging him in while becoming Kamen Rider Den-O. As Den-O assumes Climax Form to take out the grunts, Kamen Rider OOO destroys General Black with the Tatoba Kick. General Shadow attempts to escape, only to be halted by Kikaider, Kikaider 01, Inazuman and Zubat as the four destroy him. While the Double Riders destroy the Shocker Greeed, Kamen Rider OOO arrives to the other Kamen Riders' aid as they are unable to attack the Great Leader. However, upon receiving the Shocker Medal from Ankh, who uses Momotaros to create the Imagin Core Medal, Kamen Rider OOO becomes Kamen Rider OOO Tamashii Combo and knocks the Great Leader over a far distance with the Tamashii Bomber. But as King Dark is about to fight the Kamen Riders, the Great Leader assumes his true form as titanic Rock Great Leader, using his power to attack the Kamen Riders while causing a fissure that consumes King Dark and the other surviving villains. The Kamen Riders are joined by Kamen Rider Birth and all of the extra Riders  to battle the new menace, jumping onto their motorcycles to execute the All Rider Break to destroy the Great Leader once and for all. In the end, after the Kamen Riders take their leave, the man in white appears before the group as Mitsuru identifies him as his father. Furthermore, the man is revealed to be Naoki and has lived in the past and married Nokko. He eventually became a Shocker scientist so he could undo the Riders' brainwashing. As the Imagin and Shocker Medals dissolve, much to Ankh's dismay, Eiji bids Kotaro farewell before the DenLiner embarks on its next destination.Hyper Hobby, March 2011Toei Hero Max, Vol. 36"

He meets Holly Hills, who immediately becomes his love interest. Greg's manipulative older brother Rodrick tricks Greg into trying to skate with her and starts persuading violent teenagers to enter the rink. Their mother and father misunderstand and humiliate him by speaking to him on the public address/DJ system and carrying him off the rink. Afterwards, Mom has noticed that the boys haven't been getting along so she devises ""Mom Bucks"" to pay them if they spend time together where they can trade in for one real dollar, but this unwittingly makes things worse. Meanwhile, Greg and Rowley try to make a funny YouTube video by Rowley lip-synching to ""Tik Tok"" by Kesha while wearing underwear on his head. Unfortunately  it proves to be awful, getting only 4 hits. At school, Greg sees an empty seat next to Holly, but argues over it with his nemesis, Patty Ferrell. After their teacher hears that Greg is related to Rodrick, a former student in that class, he orders Greg to sit in the front of class. When a talent show is advertised on TV, the brothers see this as a big opportunity – Rowley suggests that he and Greg perform magic tricks, but Greg rejects the idea whilst Rodrick sees this as his band's big break. On Sunday, the Heffley family goes to church but Greg is extremely reluctant to go inside, as a melted 3 Musketeers chocolate bar, intentionally placed on his seat by Rodrick, has stained his trousers. Greg's mom uses her blouse to cover up the stain, but the cover-up backfires when Rodrick exposes Greg's pants. The boys ultimately end up in a scuffle on the floor and as punishment, they are to spend a whole weekend together to bond, while their parents leave to go to Rockin' Rapids. Against his parents' orders, Rodrick hosts a party at the house and locks Greg in the basement. Rowley comes to ""save"" Greg, but Rodrick locks him in the basement as well, until a call from their mother results in Rodrick letting the two out, in return for their silence on the matter. The next day, the two get a call from their mom, informing them that Manny is sick and they are returning early from their trip. The house is trashed, and the boys only have an hour to clean it up and erase all evidence of the party before their parents arrive home. When they see that one of the partygoers wrote ""Rodrick Rules"" on the bathroom door in permanent marker, they replace the door with a different one. Afterwards, Greg realizes that the new door does not have a lock, while the old one did. When their mother notices this, she confronts both boys individually. Greg confesses, but in order to prevent Rodrick from getting angry at him, he says the party was only a band rehearsal, and the two escape punishment. Rodrick thinks that Greg denied everything, and the brothers become friends. He shows Greg that he has boxes of the same play money their mom gives them for Mom Bucks and tells him ""Rodrick's Rules"". When Greg has an assignment, Rodrick tells him he had exactly the same assignment when he was in that class. Greg knew that his dad unknowingly wrote many of Rodrick's assignments for him, but when in class he reads Rodrick's ""100 Years Ago"" assignment, his teacher knows it is Rodrick's paper and gives him an ""F "". Rodrick explains that his dad wrote his papers because of the ""100 Years Ago"" paper After playing a game of soccer during Phys Ed, Greg then finds a note from Holly Hills in his locker, and he goes to her art room as appointed in the letter, only to find Chirag, who has dressed up as Holly to trick Greg in revenge for Greg pretending he was invisible. In the hallway, Holly passes by and greets Greg as Fregley, which upsets Greg. At lunch, he eats a corndog that Chirag is holding as the Invisible Chirag joke is in the entire Westmore Middle School cafeteria and surrounding rooms by now. Meanwhile, Rowley comes for a sleepover with the Heffleys, and they watch a horror movie called ""The Foot"". After the movie, Greg and Rowley become paranoid about the killer coming for them. Then Rodrick gives them a ride in the back of his van only to talk about his band's new song, Exploded Diaper, performing at the talent show which was the same one as the one that was advertised on TV and he tries to give them ""brain damage"" by finding every speed bump in Westmore. The boys go out for a night of fun, getting smoothies and pranking unsuspecting people. However, one prank goes too far and Coach Malone chases them into a mall. They escape by tricking him and return home laughing, only to find that their father has inadvertently come across photos of the party that Rodrick threw. Greg is grounded for two weeks with no video games, and Rodrick is grounded for a month and is not allowed to participate in the talent show. Greg tries to apologize but Rodrick, realizing that Greg had lied to him, only says that they are no longer friends and they return to being rivals. The boys spend the weekend with their grandfather in his retirement home Leisure Village, where Greg encounters Holly, who is visiting her grandmother. Holly apologizes to Greg for calling him Fregley, and Greg learns that Holly has a mean older sister and a spoiled little sister, just as Greg has a mean older brother and a spoiled little brother. Before going to sleep, Greg writes in his diary his feelings about Holly Hills; Rodrick gets possession of the diary and reads it aloud, which wakes Greg up. Rodrick then threatens to tell Holly Hills and runs towards the lobby to do so. Greg chases after Rodrick in his underwear and manages to snatch away the diary. He runs to the bathroom, rips out 2 pages from the diary, and flushes them down the toilet. He discovers he is in the ladies' bathroom, but manages to escape the mob of angry women who think he is a ""peeping tom"". However, he finds that Rodrick caught everything on tape via security camera and is threatening to show it to everyone. At the talent show a few nights later, Rowley's magic performance is unable to take place, as his eight-year-old assistant Scotty gets stage fright. Greg's mom suggests that Greg will do the show with Rowley, but Greg refuses, saying that he will look humiliated. When Rodrick goes to his band, Greg follows and watches Rodrick's band member, Bill Walter, kick him out of the band he created. Greg bargains with his mom to allow Rodrick to perform; in exchange, he will perform with Rowley, which his mom accepts. Rodrick thanks their mom, sees Greg, and nods at him for letting him play. During a guitar solo, Rodrick kicks Bill out of the band. The magic show is a hit with the audience and Holly meets Greg and Rowley backstage to tell him she loved their show. However, Patty Farrell says it was ""pathetic"". Rodrick and his band perform but the crowd is not impressed until they see Greg's mom dancing, and start to dance along. Greg is happy for finally having fixed the problems with his family. Rodrick drives Greg to school, as the boys have now forgiven each other.

Greg's manipulative older brother Rodrick tricks Greg into trying to skate with her and starts persuading violent teenagers to enter the rink. Their mother and father misunderstand and humiliate him by speaking to him on the public address/DJ system and carrying him off the rink. Afterwards, Mom has noticed that the boys haven't been getting along so she devises ""Mom Bucks"" to pay them if they spend time together where they can trade in for one real dollar, but this unwittingly makes things worse. Meanwhile, Greg and Rowley try to make a funny YouTube video by Rowley lip-synching to ""Tik Tok"" by Kesha while wearing underwear on his head. Unfortunately  it proves to be awful, getting only 4 hits. At school, Greg sees an empty seat next to Holly, but argues over it with his nemesis, Patty Ferrell. After their teacher hears that Greg is related to Rodrick, a former student in that class, he orders Greg to sit in the front of class. When a talent show is advertised on TV, the brothers see this as a big opportunity – Rowley suggests that he and Greg perform magic tricks, but Greg rejects the idea whilst Rodrick sees this as his band's big break. On Sunday, the Heffley family goes to church but Greg is extremely reluctant to go inside, as a melted 3 Musketeers chocolate bar, intentionally placed on his seat by Rodrick, has stained his trousers. Greg's mom uses her blouse to cover up the stain, but the cover-up backfires when Rodrick exposes Greg's pants. The boys ultimately end up in a scuffle on the floor and as punishment, they are to spend a whole weekend together to bond, while their parents leave to go to Rockin' Rapids. Against his parents' orders, Rodrick hosts a party at the house and locks Greg in the basement. Rowley comes to ""save"" Greg, but Rodrick locks him in the basement as well, until a call from their mother results in Rodrick letting the two out, in return for their silence on the matter. The next day, the two get a call from their mom, informing them that Manny is sick and they are returning early from their trip. The house is trashed, and the boys only have an hour to clean it up and erase all evidence of the party before their parents arrive home. When they see that one of the partygoers wrote ""Rodrick Rules"" on the bathroom door in permanent marker, they replace the door with a different one. Afterwards, Greg realizes that the new door does not have a lock, while the old one did. When their mother notices this, she confronts both boys individually. Greg confesses, but in order to prevent Rodrick from getting angry at him, he says the party was only a band rehearsal, and the two escape punishment. Rodrick thinks that Greg denied everything, and the brothers become friends. He shows Greg that he has boxes of the same play money their mom gives them for Mom Bucks and tells him ""Rodrick's Rules"". When Greg has an assignment, Rodrick tells him he had exactly the same assignment when he was in that class. Greg knew that his dad unknowingly wrote many of Rodrick's assignments for him, but when in class he reads Rodrick's ""100 Years Ago"" assignment, his teacher knows it is Rodrick's paper and gives him an ""F "". Rodrick explains that his dad wrote his papers because of the ""100 Years Ago"" paper After playing a game of soccer during Phys Ed, Greg then finds a note from Holly Hills in his locker, and he goes to her art room as appointed in the letter, only to find Chirag, who has dressed up as Holly to trick Greg in revenge for Greg pretending he was invisible. In the hallway, Holly passes by and greets Greg as Fregley, which upsets Greg. At lunch, he eats a corndog that Chirag is holding as the Invisible Chirag joke is in the entire Westmore Middle School cafeteria and surrounding rooms by now. Meanwhile, Rowley comes for a sleepover with the Heffleys, and they watch a horror movie called ""The Foot"". After the movie, Greg and Rowley become paranoid about the killer coming for them. Then Rodrick gives them a ride in the back of his van only to talk about his band's new song, Exploded Diaper, performing at the talent show which was the same one as the one that was advertised on TV and he tries to give them ""brain damage"" by finding every speed bump in Westmore. The boys go out for a night of fun, getting smoothies and pranking unsuspecting people. However, one prank goes too far and Coach Malone chases them into a mall. They escape by tricking him and return home laughing, only to find that their father has inadvertently come across photos of the party that Rodrick threw. Greg is grounded for two weeks with no video games, and Rodrick is grounded for a month and is not allowed to participate in the talent show. Greg tries to apologize but Rodrick, realizing that Greg had lied to him, only says that they are no longer friends and they return to being rivals. The boys spend the weekend with their grandfather in his retirement home Leisure Village, where Greg encounters Holly, who is visiting her grandmother. Holly apologizes to Greg for calling him Fregley, and Greg learns that Holly has a mean older sister and a spoiled little sister, just as Greg has a mean older brother and a spoiled little brother. Before going to sleep, Greg writes in his diary his feelings about Holly Hills; Rodrick gets possession of the diary and reads it aloud, which wakes Greg up. Rodrick then threatens to tell Holly Hills and runs towards the lobby to do so. Greg chases after Rodrick in his underwear and manages to snatch away the diary. He runs to the bathroom, rips out 2 pages from the diary, and flushes them down the toilet. He discovers he is in the ladies' bathroom, but manages to escape the mob of angry women who think he is a ""peeping tom"". However, he finds that Rodrick caught everything on tape via security camera and is threatening to show it to everyone. At the talent show a few nights later, Rowley's magic performance is unable to take place, as his eight-year-old assistant Scotty gets stage fright. Greg's mom suggests that Greg will do the show with Rowley, but Greg refuses, saying that he will look humiliated. When Rodrick goes to his band, Greg follows and watches Rodrick's band member, Bill Walter, kick him out of the band he created. Greg bargains with his mom to allow Rodrick to perform; in exchange, he will perform with Rowley, which his mom accepts. Rodrick thanks their mom, sees Greg, and nods at him for letting him play. During a guitar solo, Rodrick kicks Bill out of the band. The magic show is a hit with the audience and Holly meets Greg and Rowley backstage to tell him she loved their show. However, Patty Farrell says it was ""pathetic"". Rodrick and his band perform but the crowd is not impressed until they see Greg's mom dancing, and start to dance along. Greg is happy for finally having fixed the problems with his family. Rodrick drives Greg to school, as the boys have now forgiven each other. Rodrick also gives him a tape containing that ""embarrassing moment"" at Leisure Towers. The boys then create a new friendship, realizing it is fun to have a brother. Later, Greg and Rowely put the video of the talent contest on YouTube and call it ""Lame Band with Crazy Mom Dancing"" which becomes a huge instant hit. They then hear Rodrick shout ""Greg, you are so dead!"", and the film closes."

This news footage is intercut with shots of the movie's main protagonist, skinhead Novica, protesting by leading chants and lighting flares in front of the embassy while he's also providing narration. The story than backs up as Novica , a timid and geeky high school student with frumpy clothing and disheveled thick hair, is introduced. He lives in Belgrade where his life revolves around attending advanced math classes for gifted kids and taking part in math competitions. Due to his awkwardness around people, his social life is nothing to speak of - his only friends are his stoner cousin Mirko  as well as an even nerdier math colleague Stanislav . At a math competition as the students are working away solving problems, Novica is pressured into cheating by Relja, a confident skinhead full of bravado who is also gifted at math, but doesn't quite possess Novica's math problem-solving skills. Relja is seated relatively close to Novica at the competition and is stuck on a question that he can't solve. Obviously flattered by the attention from a kid placed much higher on the high school social scale, Novica passes Relja the solution written on a piece of paper. The competition supervisor notices something untoward occurred and tells Novica to report the person he'd helped without penalty to himself. Wanting to cover for Relja, Novica purposely wrongly points out nerdy Stanislav as the recipient of his help, leading to the supervisor throwing both Novica and Stanislav out thus breaking her promise to spare Novica. Outside, Relja is happy and impressed with Novica's behaviour under pressure, handing him a copy of Hitler's Mein Kampf as well as extending an invite to a lecture by professor Hadži-Tankosić  at the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Philosophy. Novica brings his cousin Mirko along who, dissatisfied with the right-wing, anti-Semitic overtones in professor's lecture, leaves early on. Novica, on the other hand, remains and is very much receptive to what he's hearing. The next day Relja takes Novica to a football match since his skinheads are active as fans of FK Radnik - corrupt lower-league club financed by the local gangster nicknamed Pufta . Though seemingly faithful supporters of the club, they don't care much for football, mostly using the matches as the public platform to raise the group's profile and further their right-wing political agenda through racist chanting, violence, and hooliganism. Additionally, skinheads have an extremely antagonistic relationship with the club's financier Pufta, regularly getting into fights with ""Pufta's diesel boys"" - small group of fans on his payroll. Since he doesn't own the club, Pufta's motivation for getting involved with football is taking advantage of his vaguely defined ""financier role"" in order to siphon off the funds from player transfers abroad. As he conducts his business in ruthless manner, his biggest rivals are similarly run FK Kosančić, the club that also has a financier - a mafia widow. At this particular match FK Radnik is playing FK Novi Pazar and there's no shortage of hateful chants and violence as Novica and Relja, among others, get taken to the police station where they're questioned by corrupt inspector Milutin  and young idealistic policewoman Lidija  who recently joined the force. She immediately notices that Novica doesn't really fit the usual skinhead profile and encourages him to get out, even giving him her personal contact in case he ever needs help. Couple of days later, Relja formally introduces Novica to the various individuals that make up his skinhead, white supremacist group, including his sexy girlfriend Mina  and computer geek Svarog, all of whom hang out in an underground swastika-adorned cave where they mostly guzzle beer and listen to hard core bands such as Direktori. As it turns out, Novica already knows Mina from the neighbourhood  and already harbours some emotions towards her. Mina sedues Novica, symbolising his seduction into the world of racist skinheads. After having passionate sex in a room filled with nazi-symbols, Mina has Novica sitting naked while she cuts off his hair. Hanging out one night, under the influence of alcohol, the group is walking along the river quay when they run into one of the diesel boys who's all by himself. In addition to belonging to their hated rival group, he's also a Gypsy, which makes him even more of a target in their eyes. The skinheads pin him down to the ground, giving him a beating using fists and boots. Novica is especially up for confrontation as he charges the incapacitated Gypsy with a concrete block, smashing his head with it thus killing him instantly. Shocked by the gruesome crime Novica just committed, other skinheads panic a bit before regrouping and deciding to dump the body into the river and sink with it with rocks."

Deepak keeps declining this idea. Deepak Chander is a musician who falls in love with one of his fans named Jyoti. Jyoti is a good dancer and Deepak informs his parents by way of telegram that he has chosen a girl. Deepak promises he would pay off the debts owed by Jyoti's father. But when Deepak reaches his home in Bombay, he finds that his own father, Ramesh, has committed suicide due to bankruptcy. Ramesh also expresses his last wish that his second wife and her daughter be taken care of. Due to these incidents, Deepak is delayed in Bombay and is unable to return to Kashmir within a week. Meanwhile, in Kashmir, the Jyot's creditor asks Jyoti's father for money and Jyoti expresses her inability to pay back money now. At this, the creditor gives a warning to Jyoti's dad. Fearing the creditor, when Deepak does arrive at the house of Jyoti in Kashmir, Jyoti's father lies to Deepak that he has married off his daughter to the creditor. Deepak is heartbroken and returns home. Seth Badri Prasad, a rich man who was the childhood friend of Ramsh Chander, bails out Deepak from the bankruptcy problem, requests all of Ramesh's creditors, to whom Ramesh had pledged the bungalow for loans, to not to file suit against Deepak and that they should auction the bunglow and he would by himself buy it. When Deepak comes to know of this, he feels indebted to Seth Badri Prasad. Since Deepak became an adult, Badri Prasad had been forcing his friend Ramesh Chander to ask Deepak to marry Asha . After Deepak returns to Bombay, his mother suggests him that he should now get settled in his life and bring some happiness in his life and for that he needs to marry Asha. After much hesitation, Deepak marries Asha, his childhood friend and daughter of Badri Prasad. During the wedding, Deepak observes that among the audience, there is woman who looks similar to Jyoti. Deepak then, on his wedding night itself, goes and searches for the Jyoti lookalike in many hotels and lodges and at last finds that the woman was none other than Jyoti herself. Now Deepak comes to know that Jyoti was not married to Hukumchand and that her father had lied to him. Jyoti, in helping Mauji, had come to Bombay in search of Deepak. Jyoti also discloses to Deepak that she is the mother of Deepak's child. On knowing this, Deepak decides to end his marriage with Asha and to tell Asha the truth. But Jyoti insists that this would be a big shock to Asha and that Asha would not be able to remarry as the society might discard her. Jyoti thus asks Deepak to consider as if he had never met her and continue to have a good married life with Asha. Thus, for the welfare of Asha, Jyoti insists that Deepak be a loyal husband of Asha and that she would take care of Deepak's child by herself. Later Jyoti becomes a popular dance teacher in her city. Although Deepak marries Asha, whenever he goes near Asha, he has memories of Jyoti and thus avoids going near her. Asha decides to learn dancing form Jyoti. As a year goes by Jyoti and Asha become very close friends. Asha discloses that her husband is not loving her and that although a year has passed since their wedding day, her husband does not even come close to her. Jyoti visits Asha's home and learns that Asha is none other than Deepak's second wife. Jyoti then advices Deepak to be a true husband to Asha and give Asha the pleasures of married life. Gradually Asha learns that Jyoti and Deepak were lovers even before her marriage to Deepak. Asha suspects that Jyoti may have taken advantage of her telling secrets to Jyoti and that Jyoti is having an extramarital affair with Deepak. The rest of the story is about how Asha will come to know that both Deepak and Jyoti are well wishers of Asha and are completely innocent, and that they were also victims of the unpredictable nature of fate. After coming to know the truth of exact nature of events, both Asha and Jyoti, decide to sacrifice their respective lives to let the other live a nice happy married life with Deepak.

The film begins in the Professor's lab, where he and his Assistant conduct some experiments. As a result, the computer produces the image of a hedgehog. Professor sends his assistant to find one. Some time later, Jerzy and his colleagues are seen sitting under the palm on the Charles de Gaulle 's Roundabout in Warsaw. They attract the attention of two policewomen, who rush to arrest them, but instead they cause the road accident. A bus is about to crush a young boy, but Jerzy saves him. His actions are witnessed by a Politician  and the Assistant. Jerzy tries to buy some food in a Vietnamese hut, but is interrupted first by Lilka, the prostitute, and then Yola, his lover, who invites him for a ride with her ""friends"". They are followed by the Assistant, who observes their actions. In the meantime, Stefan wakes up in the middle of the night after having a nightmare . The next day Stefan and Zenek are seen sitting on the bench in front of the apartment blocks, discussing about the problems of Poland . Upon seeing Jerzy and Yola, they attack them, but are defeated. Yola kisses Jerzy, but then her husband - Krzysztof - appears, in the state of shock upon seeing his wife in hands of another man. Yola saves the situation by claiming Jerzy rescued her from the ""bandits"" and the kiss was in fact mechanical ventilation. Stefan and Zenek are approached by Assistant, who offers them a job. He takes them to the Professor's lab and tells them to acquire Jerzy's DNA , then kill him. Jerzy is at the market square, buying flower for Yola, when he's attacked by Stefan and Zenek, who take the DNA samples ordered by Assistant. Professor then uses them to make a clone of Jerzy . The Assistant explains that from their analysis it seems Jerzy has a full potential to become a pop star, but there was a problem: he couldn't be contained. That's why he and Professor decided to clone him. Their plan is to use the clone to make money - but before, they have to kill the original Jerzy. Jerzy meets with Yola in amusement park, but as he walks to the bar to make an order, the clone appears and tries to rape Yola, enraging her and resulting in her leaving the rendezvous. As Jerzy tries to explain everything, he's captured by Assistant, who mistakes him for the clone. He escapes to the House of Terror, but as he rushes outside, he's spotted by Stefan and Zenek, who then collide with the clone and beat him, before being stopped by Yola. She drives the clone home, thinking he's the original Jerzy. However as the clone abuses her again, she throws him out of the taxi and drives home. The true Jerzy is already waiting there, but Yola doesn't listen to his explanations. The heartbroken hedgehog drunks himself in front of the liquor store. Suddenly his cell phone rings and ""Yola""  asks him to meet under Poniatowskiego bridge. There, Jerzy is confronted by Stefan, Zenek and Assistant, who manage to knock him unconscious and throw him into the river. Then they upload a video of the clone to the internet as the first step towards fortune. However, the clone escapes and causes and explosion in the sex shop. The police arrests him. The Assistant decides to ask one of the politicians to pull him out of the prison - in return the clone will support his election campaign. In the meantime, Jerzy is rescued by Lilka, a prostitute he met earlier. The clone is set free and becomes an international celebrity. In the meantime Yola wants to come to terms with Jerzy, but she's thrown out of the club when she tries to approach him . She meets Lilka, who starts to suspect something and shows Jerzy how the Warsaw changed since he was rescued. Jerzy, initially shattered by the fact the clone stole his life and personality, is comforted by Lilka and decides to regain his good name. In the meantime, the clone's popularity grows - and so does the Politician's chances for the election. Jerzy breaks into the concert organised by the Politician where the clone is performing, finally showing that there are two hedgehogs in the town . The meeting of the two characters results in a massive fight, during which the scene is set ablaze. Sorrowful Professor finds the clone laying helplessly on the floor, but before he can help him, a beam falls and crushes the clone. In the meantime, Yola witnesses the whole fight and tries to reach Jerzy, but she's captured by the Assistant. Jerzy pursuits; Assistant's car falls from the bridge and he himself is saved by Yola, only to be punched in the face by her before being arrested. Yola finally comes to terms with Jerzy. As they talk on the bridge, Professor finds out the clone is still alive, but lets him go, believing he'll manage without him. However, the clone is found by the two Vietnamese chiefs and turned into their meal. Lilka thanks Jerzy for realising her dreams of being famous. The next day, Stefan is awakened by his mother. To his horror, his brother Michał  pays them a visit. Even worse, Zenek arrives, but quickly runs away, seeing a black person in Stefan's house. The two meet outside on the bench and Stefan explains the origins of his brother: his mother went to Africa and after being captured by a local tribe she was ""cursed"" by the sorcerer  resulting in Michał's birth. To comfort his friend, Zenek tells him his own story: he was captured by aliens who seemed to conduct experiments on him . Suddenly it turns out Jerzy is standing behind them all the time and has heard their stories. As he escapes on his skateboard, he accidentally runs into camera, crashes to the ground and weakly exclaims ""Goddamn operator"" offscreen before the ending sequence. The credits contain several more sequences: Professor buying a dinner from Vietnamese food store , Krzysztof having a walk with Yola, politician trying to restore his popularity and a drunkard buying vodka from Professor in his lab . A post-credit scene shows the Assistant trying to communicate with his cellmates."

Principal K.Viswanath opposes that proposal vehemently with the support of few trustees. Kireet then tells the principal to show positive results in at least one sport if he wants to hold on to the playground. Viswanath comes up with a proposal that the playground should be retained if GHS’s cricket team manages to win the State level cricket league tournament. He summons his former GHS student, Sampath, an idealist who leads a dejected life. Sampath, after confronting Kireet, joins GHS as the cricket coach and he has three months to convert the disoriented GHS cricket team of 14 students into champions. Led by Siddanth and their lack of discipline, the team initially resists Sampath's training. Despite trying to get under Sampath's skin, they fail to persuade their coach to change his methods. Frustrated, Siddanth challenges Sampath to a students vs. teachers cricket game--the deal being that if the students win, they will not follow Sampath's coaching anymore. Towards the end of the game, the frustrated Siddanth deserts his losing team. Gowtham subsequently takes over captaincy and the students manage to tie the game when Sampath purposely gets bowled out in the last over. The students get very impressed with Sampath's cricketing prowess and decide to follow his coaching despite Siddanth's opposition. Later, after Sampath helps remove a police case against another student, Mikey, they realize his compassionate nature and embrace his coaching entirely. Siddanth too follow suit. The GHS team, after coming to know of the deal between Kireet and Vishwanath over the cricket ground, get further motivated and raise their efforts towards winning every match. The team advance to the finals of the championship--the final match being against the very strong Everglades team. Right before the finals, the GHS boys come to know that the Everglades coach Sundar and Sampath share some bad blood from the past. When Sampath refuses to reveal his personal history with Sundar, they start doubting Sampath and lose focus, letting their opponents amass over 190 runs in 20 overs. During the break, Vishwanath, coming to know of the misunderstanding between coach and team, tells the boys exactly what had happened between Sampath and Sundar almost 15 years ago--Sundar, also an ex GHS student Sundar purposely got Sampath run out during the final championship match, where latter had played brilliantly. To attain personal glory, Sundar went onto black list Sampath, depriving him of any future in cricket. The team, upon realising the truth, apologise to Sampath for misunderstanding him. Sampath motivates them with a stirring speech subsequently. GHS comes onto field with 10 batsmen as Siddanth suffers an injury during fielding. They virtually chase down the big score and the match is tantalizingly poised in the last over. Siddhanth, to the surprise of everyone, unexpectedly comes back from injury and wins the game for GHS on the last ball. Golconda High School wins the championship for the first time in 15 years, and the cricket ground is saved.

Gene rushes to Thorpe's ranch, concerned that a hot-headed cattle rancher named Thad Morgan  may try to kill Thorpe. Morgan was once ruined financially by sheep ranching. Gene is able to stop Thorpe from bringing in the sheep, and Thorpe agrees to send the sheep back. Sometime later, Sandra Knight , who inherited the Knight Ranch from her late uncle, arrives in town with three female friends, who studied animal husbandry with her at the agricultural college. Before reaching the ranch, Sandra is approached by Thorpe's partner Briggs  who sells her the sheep. Continuing on to the ranch with the sheep, Sandra nearly hits Gene and his horse Champion. Learning about the sheep deal, Gene tries to dissuade Sandra from raising sheep, explaining that they eat grass to the root so that it cannot grow back, but Sandra doesn't listen to him. Instead of taking her to her ranch, Gene shows her to his own rocky ground and ramshackle cabin, telling her that it's her ranch. That night, as the girls try to sleep, Gene's friend, Frog Millhouse , makes wild animal noises to scare the girls into leaving the next day. One such noise sends Sandra into Gene's arms, and she asks him to sleep on the porch. The following day, Gene and Sandra go riding and come across the beautiful house and fertile land that is actually hers. Gene, who is falling in love with Sandra, is about to tell her the truth when she says she wants to lease the rocky land  for her sheep. When Morgan learns about the sheep on Gene's ranch, he rides there intending to shoot them, but Gene is able to stop him. Gene agrees to the sheriff's demand that he remove the sheep from the area in twenty-four hours. When Gene notices Frog applying Mercurochrome to a wound, he gets the idea to paint the sheep so that they will appear to have hoof-and-mouth disease. After Briggs discovers that Sandra believes she owns Gene's ranch, he offers her $5,000 for her property—a bargain for Gene's ranch, but far below the value of her own ranch, worth an estimated $100,000. When Sandra sees the painted sheep appearing diseased, she accepts Briggs's offer to buy them, and Briggs delivers the sheep to Morgan. That night at the dance, needing to keep Gene from interfering while Sandra signs over her ranch without understanding the legal implications, Briggs tells Sandra about Gene's trick. Angered by the ruse, Sandra fires Gene. Later, when Morgan confronts Gene about the sheep and draws on him, Gene pulls out his gun which fires before Gene pulls the trigger—Thorpe had rigged the gun earlier that evening. Morgan is wounded and Gene is arrested. Sandra decides to accept Briggs' offer to buy the ranch and tells her girlfriends to pack. After informing Gene about the sale, Frog helps him escape by putting up a wrecking company sign in front of the jail and paying a truck driver to pull the wall off the building. Pursued by the sheriff and a mob, Gene rides after Briggs and Sandra. After Sandra signs the deed over to Briggs, Gene pursues Briggs to the county seat and rips up the deed. The sheriff is informed that Morgan, after regaining consciousness, identified Thorpe as the one who shot him.

The story then cycles back eight years earlier, when a lustful Joong-shik accidentally causes a woman to neglect her baby with disastrous consequences. Suffering from guilt, Joong-shik goes on the lam and holes up in the titular city of Paju, an underdeveloped and desolate city just north of Seoul and near the North Korean border. Teaching religious classes to the town's schoolgirls, Joong-shik captures the heart of local house owner Eun-soo, despite the protestations of her pubescent younger sister and Joong-shik's student Eun-mo. Back in the present day, Joong-shik is now the ringleader of a political protest group whose interests run from obstructing the city's plans of gentrification to strengthening relations with North Koreans. Squatting in Paju's derelict apartments, the group is under siege from an unidentified property developer who has engaged goons to bulldoze the buildings. With only the briefest of hints as to what has transpired, Eun-soo is nowhere to be seen and Joong-shik and Eun-mo are clearly at odds. While believing her brother-in-law killed her sister for insurance money, Eun-mo finds herself falling in love with him, the sole guardian and grownup in the lonely girl's life. Narrative flashes back twice more to sparingly fill in the gaps on their shifting lives.{{cite web}}

Over the course of the next couple of the weeks, the three form a close friendship, meeting up regularly and even sleeping together in the same bed. However, it is clear that both Marie and Francis have an interest in Nicolas beyond friendship; Marie is visibly disappointed when she hopes to enjoy an intimate meal with Nicolas at a Vietnamese restaurant, only to see Francis and his friends there, and Francis is consumed by lust for Nicolas to the extent that he vigorously masturbates over the smell of Nicolas' clothes when left alone in his apartment. Both are led on by their interpretation of Nicolas' actions, such as eating a cherry from Francis' hand and telling Marie he loves them. Their feelings lead to competition between the two friends for Nicolas' affections, evidenced by their rivalry over the gifts they buy for his birthday. The relationship culminates in a trip to stay in the vacation home of Nicolas' mother. Marie becomes jealous when Nicolas feeds Francis a marshmallow, telling him to eat it slowly like a 'striptease', and she goes to bed early. The next morning, she wakes up alone and again observes the two frolicking together from afar. She decides to leave, at which point Francis chases after her and the two end up wrestling on the ground. Nicolas is not impressed and decides to leave, saying they can love him or leave him. On returning from the trip, they don't see Nicolas, both leaving messages on his answerphone and Marie writing him a love letter. Eventually, Francis meets Nicolas and ends up pouring out his feelings, telling him he loves him and wants to kiss him. The only response from Nicolas is to ask him 'How could you think I was gay?', leaving Francis devastated. Later, Marie catches up with Nicolas in the street, and tells him about the love letter, but implies she wrote it to a female friend. From this, Nicolas comes to the conclusion that Marie has a female lover, which she denies. As Nicolas goes to leave, claiming to have left something on the stove, she tells him the truth about the letter but this makes no difference. The film continues with Francis and Marie re-establishing their friendship and Nicolas moving away to Asia. In the final scene, they are again at a party, looking for potential lovers.

The squad clears away the Zombies, but is then attacked by an infected researcher who attempts to commit suicide with a grenade. Second-in-command Lieutenant Bobby Quinn , initially survives and radios for a medivac airlift, but soon falls unconscious. Later, Quinn wakes up on an exam table at Ft. Preston Army Base, to find he's being prepped for postmortem. The Coroner, Dr, Flutie , explains that he arrived in a body-bag the previous evening and had been pronounced DOA, and that he has no vital signs and is thus clinically dead. Quinn begins to get dressed and asks after the fate of his squad, which Flutie reveals are all dead. Quinn is suddenly stricken by agonizing pain in his right arm, and grabs a scalpel to slice it open. Gushing greenish blood, the wound reveals one of the strange scorpions, which he promptly crushes. The incision rapidly heals without a trace of scarring. Quinn and Flutie soon relate their findings to Dr. Boyce, who is determined to keep Quinn quarantined. Quinn, however, is driven to find out what happened to himself and his squad, and resists her directives. She tries to have him sedated, but the sedative has no effect, and in the course of the attempt, Quinn reveals superhuman strength to go with his rapid-healing and altered metabolism, and she finally reveals that one of the other members of his squad, Sgt. Cruz, is also in the morgue scheduled for cremation, and the other bodies were being taken elsewhere. Quinn demands to see him, and she takes him to Dr. Langdon  to find his whereabouts when he turns up missing. With Quinn's heightened senses, the trio tracks Cruz to the base's kitchen, where he is attacking the cook, Judson . In the process, both Boyce and Langdon are infected, and Quinn and Judson have to destroy them. Right after, Quinn is stricken by intense pangs of hunger that can only be dulled by ingesting raw, red meat. The two of them are then taken into custody by Major Bascom , who refuses to believe Quinn's story . Quinn and Judson promptly escape, determined to track down the remaining squad-members before they can wreak havoc. They manage to find the truck used to transport the bodies, arrive too late, finding it wrecked and covered in blood. While following the trail, they stop at a small road-side bar, where they meet Holly, a smart U.C San Bernardino film-student who works as a bartender part-time as she studies for her degree. Unfortunately for Quinn and Judson, the local news has already aired a report about the ""killings"" at Fort Preston, and the Bar-patrons lock them inside the cooler. When a group of infected soldiers attacks the bar, Holly retreats to the cooler, and the trio manages to eliminate the zombified soldiers and patrons before they can get out. Having been called by the patrons, the police arrive to arrest Quinn and Judson. Quinn manages to break free of his handcuffs, and Holly nabs the police cruiser and the trio escapes yet again. On the trail of the final body, Bill Sanderson, the trio change their clothes and general appearance in order to better disguise themselves , and head to L.A to intercept Sanderson if they can. However, a visit to Sanderson's home turns up nothing, and Quinn is stricken by another wave of hunger and has to raid the fridge to ease it. As he eats, a woman walks in and they mistake her for one of the family members. She reveals that she's Mrs. Wisteria from next door, and that she has been watching the house for the Sandersons who are on vacation, and that the wake isn't until the following day. They try to satisfy her by saying they need the info for a ""secret government mission"" but she insists upon helping, threatening to call the cops otherwise. The trio grudgingly agrees, and Mrs. Wisteria drives them to the Everview Funeral home where Sanderson was taken, and flirts openly with Judson to his dismay. When they arrive, the Director  tells them that Sanderson's body had already been claimed the previous evening. Frustrated, the group makes to leave, but they are intercepted when a van pulls up and the occupants stop them at gunpoint. Their captors are soon revealed to be mercenaries under the hire of a Dr. Scott , and his partner Dr. Adams . who have Sanderson chained up in their hidden lab. Scott states that the Cambodians call the scorpion-like creature a ""Jindu"", and that its sting revives dead tissue. It had been a legend until some relief workers stumbled upon the species some years back. It was Scott who sent the mercenaries that killed the workers at the relief-station, and who had themselves ended up dead. He goes on to say that the sting of the creature represents everlasting life if properly utilized, and that it would be of great benefit to the people of the world ""for the right price"". When Quinn counters that the infection must be stopped before it can spread, Scott angrily confesses that he's dying of cancer and thus seeks the secret for his own benefit first. He demands a sample of Quinn's blood, and when Quinn refuses, he brings in Mrs. Wisteria and threatens to feed her to Sanderson. Quinn relents, but Scott gives Wisteria to Sanderson anyway, and they watch as she is bitten, dies, and transforms into one of the infected Zombies, and Scott confirms that the second-generation zombies are always mindless killers: only those stung by the Jindu have the potential to retain their personalities, so long as the creature doesn't travel straight to their heart. The female merc destroys Wisteria with a shot to the head. Despite being weakened by hunger, a furious Quinn destroys Sanderson as well, before being knocked out cold. When Sanderson awakens, Scott and Adams are preparing to leave for Fort Preston. They take him back to the holding cell, and chain him to Holly while taking Judson with them as a hostage and as a guide. Holly manages to evade the ravenous Quinn until he leaps at her and misses, shattering the two-way mirror that leads into Adam's lab. Inside, he stumbles over the mini-fridge where they kept the raw meat for Sanderson, and he quickly devours it, and comes back to his senses. Scott and his group reach Fort Preston, which is now overrun with zombies, thanks to the body of one of the mercs that had been brought back from Cambodia. Scott is on the hunt for that particular zombie, since he will be the only one with the Jindu inside. The group proceeds within, destroying attacking zombies as they go, but don't realize that Quinn and Holly are hot on their trail. Scott has Judson open the security door where one of the officers had managed to trap most of the infected, and then Scott takes Judson's keycard and leaves him trapped outside the security doors, where a horde of zombies descend upon him. Inside, the group eventually finds the morgue containing the original zombie, and shut themselves inside with a mass of undead hammering away from outside. Dr. Scott manages to restrain the zombie, and cuts into his chest cavity. Quinn and Holly reach the security doors, which Quinn breaks down with a flying kick. As Scott extracts the Jindu, the zombies begin to break inside, wounding the female merc who accidentally shoots Dr. Adams, before being shot by her partner. The Zombies stream in, attacking the remaining merc. Scott drops the Jindu as Quinn and Holly burst inside. Quinn crushes the Jindu and begins to destroy the Zombies within, while Dr. Scott is attacked and literally ""disarmed"" by a pair of zombie soldiers before Quinn and Holly can shoot them down. Quinn approaches the bleeding Dr. Adams and asks after Judson, and she claims he was killed. As the pair leave the room, Holly shoots Adams before she can turn into one of the infected. Leaving, they then find Judson's crucifix necklace and fear he has been killed, but spy a trash chute and open it to reveal Judson cowering inside. Happy to see him alive, they help him out, and make plans to finish off the infected for good. Quinn takes some C4 from the base's armory, and wires it up to explode beneath the ammo-dump so it'll take out the entire base. As he moves to find a vehicle for the group to escape with, he has Judson and Holly bait the zombies as close to the ammo-dump as possible. Quinn struggles to find a vehicle that isn't damaged, as Judson and Holly narrowly escape a group of hungry undead they have drawn towards the ammo-dump, and activate the 2-minute timer. Barely escaping, the base goes up in flames, and afterward, the trio scour the wreckage to make sure all the zombies are truly out of commission. With the undead finished, Quinn, Holly, and Judson walk away to plan their futures, with Holly saying ""this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship."""
30430254	/m/0g5r6ps	Eyeborgs				{}	{}	"{""/m/06n90"": ""Science Fiction""}"	"{{Plot}} The movie opens by explaining current events such as the passing of the ""Freedom of Observation Act"" and the subsequent implementation of ODIN , including the development of a new type of mobile camera drone, the eponymous ""eyeborg"". The system is administered by the Department of Homeland Security. The movie transitions to a meeting in a dark room, where Sankur  is making a deal to purchase a shotgun while an eyeborg watches the transaction. The eyeborg is discovered and the deal is aborted just as the video feed from the eyeborg is interrupted. Homeland Security agents rush in to find that Sankur has escaped and the other party in the gun deal is dead. In the next scene, Brandon   is in a car with a girl. They are approached by a shadowy character who is identified only as ""G-Man"" , who delivers a bag of North Carolina Tobacco, a rare find since smoking is banned. After G-Man leaves, the two begin smoking the tobacco before they are interrupted and killed by a large six-armed eyeborg. With Brandon missing, Jarett  becomes the de facto lead singer of ""Painful Daze"" at a gig played the next night. He's singing as eyeborgs search for Sankur, who has entered the building. During the concert, Sankur pulls out the shotgun and prepares to fire before the eyeborgs in the room signal an alarm and panic ensues. Sankur tries to shoot Jarett but an eyeborg blocks the shot. Jarett falls, unharmed, to the ground but breaks his guitar in so doing. It is revealed that Jarett is the President's nephew. Sankur is taken to the regional DHS office and, while being interrogated, is shown video footage of his earlier gun deal, which concludes with his use of the shotgun to kill the dealer. Sankur insists that he did not kill the dealer despite the video providing evidence to the contrary. Agent Gunner  gets a message to report to the front desk, leaves the room with his partner, and locks the door. Four eyeborgs mounted around the room as security cameras detach, fall to the floor, and begin to attack Sankur. In the middle of the attack, the door unlocks and he is released from the room. A brief foot chase occurs, stranding him on level six. When an elevator upon which he is waiting opens, a large eyeborg emerges and pushes him over the banister, causing him to fall six stories through the open atrium to the bottom floor, killing him. Jarett and Ronni  are making out when the news is announced that the President has declared war on Zimbekistan, which catches Ronni's attention. She shows Jarett a bank error where a large sum of money has been deposited in their account from Zimbekistan. Back at the regional DHS office, Agent Gunner comes under fire for security footage showing that he failed to lock Sankur's door. Meanwhile, Barbara   and Eric  , who earlier witnessed Sankur's death, find a video file in Sankur's apartment. Meanwhile, Jarett goes to G-Man, whose face is finally revealed, and asks him to fix his guitar. During their meeting they discuss the eyeborgs, which Jarett approves of and which G-Man doesn't trust. Eric analyzes the video from Sankur's apartment and calls Barbara to tell her the video file is fake. En route in a news van to give her the evidence, he is attacked by a new type of eyeborg. It force feeds him a bottle of Shelley's whiskey and forces him to crash, attempting to make it look like the result of intoxication. While he manages to get out of the news van alive, he is immolated by a flamethrower carried the eyeborg that attacked him. Barbara is notified of the wreck and, when told that he was drunk at the time of the accident, she doesn't believe it. Shortly thereafter, G-Man is attacked and killed by a large eyeborg. Jarett arrives and is momentarily pinned to the ground by the escaping eyeborg, after which he find's G-Man's body. He tells Gunner what he saw, but video of the alley shows a human leaving G-Man's place rather than an eyeborg. Growing increasingly suspicious, Gunner asks Jarett to meet him. During the secret meeting, Gunner tells Jarett that he believes that Jarett did see an eyeborg leaving the scene of G-Man's murder, and that he suspects the system is compromised and the President may be in danger. He asks Jarett for help in warning the President, since Jarett has been asked to play at the President's up and coming campaign debate. While Jarett is out, Ronni is attacked by two eyeborgs and manages to call him, but the call is cut short. When he arrives, he finds her dead, with her wrists slit as though she had committed suicide. Jim Bradley  and Gunner go back to G-Man's to see if they missed anything, and they find a secret room containing plans for weapon-carrying eyeborgs, plus a malleable C4 variant which was formed into the pickguard on Jarett's guitar. They try to leave to warn the President that Jarett's guitar is a bomb, and Jim is killed by an eyeborg which Gunner manages to disable. Gunner gets to the Millennium Center, where the Presidential debate is being held. But when he arrives onstage, there is no President or crowd present. He realizes that the President is dead, and that ODIN is in control and has been using Presidential power to declare war so that it can spread. A group of warbots show up and begin firing on the DHS agents. Barbara is run into by her new camera bot, but she tells Gunner where he is most likely to find Jarett. Gunner and his team manage to free Jarett, whose likeness is being scanned for use by ODIN, just as two newer and more deadly eyeborgs attack and kill all but Jarett, Gunner, and Barbara. As Gunner is leaving with Jarett, Barbara gives him the only video evidence of what happened at the Millennium Center. Too injured to leave, herself, she buys them more time when she shoots the eyeborgs to distract them before she then shoots the guitar, detonating it and the barrels of flammable liquid in the basement, resulting in the complete destruction of the Millennium Center. With the explosion of the Millennium Center broadcast on national television, the President is considered dead. The news shows the vice-president being sworn in, and in an address to the public declares Jarett a traitor and shows video of him detonating his guitar in the debates, killing the President and all in attendance. Gunner goes to see Jarett, who is alive and disguised as an altar boy, and tells him that Barbara's video has gone viral and even ODIN cannot stop it. The movie ends with Gunner shooting an eyeborg in an alley and declaring he does not need their eyes anymore."

Otto, a young East Frisian country boy, comes to the big city to make his fortune. Unfortunately, his naivety nearly ruins everything from the start as he falls victim to a loan shark—conveniently going under the name of ""Shark""—from whom he borrows the capital to start his own forwarding business; the resulting debt of 9,876 DM and 50 Pfennig becomes a constant object of worry and temptation for Otto throughout the film. During one of his earlier attempts to make money, Otto inadvertently saves the life of Silvia von Kohlen und Reibach, the young heiress of an enormously wealthy family. Otto is introduced to the Kohlen und Reibachs to receive their gratitude, but Otto is quick to note that he could use their wealth to pay back his debt. But every chance he gets slips through his fingers, either owing to the callings of his conscience  or by dumb luck . Silvia and Otto also find themselves drawn to each other, but their greatest hazard against their getting together is Silvia's stern mother, Konsulin (""[[Consul  von Kohlen und Reibach, who wishes her daughter to marry befitting to her status and who has selected a prospective candidate named Ernesto, a handsome South American millionaire. In the end, Otto realizes his true affections for Silvia only after she and her mother prepare to depart for Rio de Janeiro for Silvia's wedding to Ernesto. On his way to tell Silvia about his feelings, Otto gets mixed up in a bank robbery committed by disputatious Sonnemann and Haenlein. Otto later smuggles himself aboard the plane the Kohlen und Reibachs are in, but among the passengers are also the two bankrobbers. Otto, disguised as the radioman, attempts to inform Interpol but instead hits the pilot's announcement system, prompting Sonnemann and Haenlein to hijack the plane. Unfortunately, the two break out into another argument, in which course they knock out both pilots, so they force Otto to fly. This of course wreaks havoc as Otto sends the plane rolling, subduing the two bankrobbers in the process; Otto reveals his presence and his love to Silvia, who happily joins him in the cockpit, and Konsulin von Kohle und Reichbach has to learn to her shock that ""Ernesto"" is really a fraud named Harald. Otto subsequently attempts to land the passenger jet on an aircraft carrier, but of course fails spectacularly, thus looping back to the situation in which he is first seen at the start of the film. Fortunately, all passengers on the plane, including Silvia and her mother, reach a tropical island, where they receive a warm welcome from the local carnival-obsessed natives and Otto and Silvia finally become an item."

After an hour spent gambling and socializing, the group prepares to leave. Ronnie, however, has lost money playing roulette, and must cash in a check at the cashier's window. He is accompanied there by Roy but, unbeknownst to either of them, the cashier is being threatened by a man with a gun. Using a concealed security alarm, the cashier alerts casino officials who then converge on the window believing that Roy and Ronnie are also involved in the gunman's attempted robbery. All three are apprehended. Outside the casino moments later, Al persuades the police to release Roy and Ronnie, but the inquisitive Ronnie has already become obsessed with the concept of a spectacular casino robbery, and he abruptly begins forming his own plans to rob Harold's Club after he overhears a bystander lament, “There's no way it  can be done.” Once back at college, the incident is seemingly forgotten, though Ronnie immediately begins developing his plans in earnest whilst the others are preoccupied by the beginning of the new term. Al is also preoccupied by his desire to reestablish his relationship with his girlfriend, Kaye , who has recently become a singer at a local nightclub. Determined to see her perform, Al takes Brick, Roy and Ronnie to see one of Kaye's first shows. After the performance, Brick, a Korean War veteran, is provoked into fighting a fellow student over a former girlfriend and, afterward, he suffers from the effects of a dissociative psychotic episode due to an ongoing battle with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder . Later in the night, Al encourages a distraught Brick to return to a veteran’s hospital for treatment, but he refuses. Together, the two agree to move on.  Some time later, Ronnie finalizes an actual plan to rob Harold’s Club. Claiming that the robbery would be an adventurous “first” [experience] in their otherwise ordinary lives, Ronnie reveals the plan to Brick and Roy. Ronnie then maintains that if the robbery were a success, all the stolen money would be returned, thereby ensuring that no one involved would be guilty of a prosecutable crime. Though initially skeptical, Brick and Roy gradually abandon their misgivings. The wealthy Ronnie then uses his personal inheritance funds to purchase an untraceable trailer and car and fabricate a wooden cart that is identical to the cash carts used at Harold's — the most important component of the heist. Though his preparations are complete, Ronnie determines that the robbery can only go ahead if Al is present for it, since he maintains that at least four people will be needed for the dangerously complex operation. But Brick, Roy and Ronnie agree that Al will not go along with the robbery if he is made aware of it beforehand. Coincidentally, the day before the robbery, Al proposes to Kaye, and they decide to go to Reno with the others to celebrate their engagement. On the way to Reno, Al recognizes the cart's design while riding in the trailer and inadvertently triggers play of a sinister audio recording somehow connected to a button on the cart's handle and played through a small reel-to-reel recorder hidden inside the cart itself. The message reveals Ronnie's robbery plans to Kaye and Al. Shocked, they refuse to participate. Brick then intervenes. Pulling a hidden revolver from his baggage, Brick seizes control of the robbery. Fearing a life of destitution and confinement, the increasingly volatile and disturbed Brick explains that the robbery will go ahead as intended, despite Al and Kaye’s objections, but with one significant exception: the money will not be returned to the casino. Additionally, Brick promises to kill Al if anyone attempts to sabotage the plan. Once they arrive at the casino, the robbery is carried out efficiently as Reno’s casino district is filled with costumed partiers celebrating a distracting cowboy-themed fête, and in the chaotic festivities the disguised Brick, Ronnie and Al blend into the crowd, going completely unnoticed by casino security while convincing a cart operator  to retrieve cash from the casino's money room through a clever ploy — using the prerecorded message on the tape recorder inside the counterfeit cart to frighten the man into playing along. After the final moments of the robbery, Brick leaves the others behind and escapes with the money but is pursued, by Al, into a casino parking structure. Kaye, having alerted police, follows them, and a tense standoff takes place. Ultimately, Al convinces Brick to give up peacefully and the gathered police officers escort Brick from the scene while promising to treat him fairly. No one else is arrested and, in the final shot, Al and Kaye embrace on a crowded street.

The interviewers turn him down when they discover his low-caste roots. Deepak relates the incident to his mentor, Dr. Prabhakar Anand . Dr Anand, the legendary principal of renowned STM college, offers Deepak an interim job as a teacher at STM. Deepak is comforted by his friend, Sushant , and his girlfriend Poorbi , who is Dr. Anand's daughter. The state minister, Baburam, wishes to enroll his no-good nephew at STM. Dr. Anand however, turns him down. The minister decides to install his own man, Mithilesh Singh, on the STM college board. Cunning and greedy, Mithilesh seeks only to enrich himself. The minister's grand ambition is to build a multi-billion educational conglomerate, and plans to use Mithilesh's outside business—a coaching class—for it. The Supreme Court grants reservations for Other Backward Classes. A large crowd of STM students, boisterously celebrating the ruling, arrive at the gates of STM and start a ruckus. Sushant gathers a group of upper-caste boys and tries to drive off the revellers. Dr. Anand hauls Deepak and Sushant, but is shocked to find that Deepak has turned on him. Poorbi later confronts Deepak and orders him to apologise to her father, but he refuses, leading to their break-up. The backward classes welcome reservations because it provides additional opportunities for education. The upper classes are against reservations because they believe in a level-playing field. These arguments are played out between Sushant and Deepak. The moderate STM administrators are afraid that college-level reservations may create conflicts between the students. When asked by a reporter, Dr. Anand shares his personal opinion – that some form of reservation, free of politics and economics, is good for society. The next day's headlines scream that Dr. Anand favours reservations. The STM board is outraged; Dr. Anand is warned that Mithilesh will use this to oust him. Dr. Anand resigns from STM, and Mithilesh is appointed as the new principal. Dr Anand resolves to take out Mithilesh with the only weapon left: teaching. He approaches his friend, Shambhu the cowherd, and takes shelter at the tabela . He begins teaching small groups of needy and backward students from the bastee , at the cowshed. His first success is MuniyaShambhu's daughter, who comes in first place at the board exam. Muniya's principal offers to send more students to Dr. Anand's tabela school. Deepak and Sushant return to Dr. Anand and join forces, teaching at the tabela school. The tabela students fare much better at the exams than their classmates. The tabela school's reputation grows and begins to draw away students at Mithilesh's coaching class. Mithilesh responds by obtaining a legal permit to demolish the cowshed. The situation is diffused by the arrival of Shakuntala Tai, the reclusive magnate who started the STM institutions. She calls the chief minister, who promptly averts the destruction of the cowshed. Mithilesh is dismissed, and Dr. Anand is installed as the chief trustee of the STM and lifelong principal of the newly-created STM Remedial Center.

Paul Cutler  is an ex-military L.A.P.D. S.W.A.T. officer and considered to be one of the best, not even holding a record of having civilian casualties for ten years. After successfully rescuing hostages with no casualties, Cutler is requested to train the Detroit S.W.A.T. with an updated training curriculum from the F.B.I.'s Hostage Rescue Team training program. Shortly after arriving in Detroit, Cutler immediately imposes his authority and has a rough time with the Captain  of the department as well as one of the senior S.W.A.T. leaders Justin Kellogg . During the middle of a training exercise, the team responds to an emergency call when ex-government agent Walter Hatch  is holding his girlfriend  hostage. The girl is rescued but takes Officer Kellogg's handgun and asks Cutler to move so she can shoot Hatch. When Cutler tries to calm her down, she puts the gun to her head and commits suicide. Cutler's 10 year record with no hostages lost is broken and it takes its toll on him. The rift between Cutler and Kellogg escalates at a local bar, where Cutler makes a bet for Kellogg to beat him in a higher score with an arcade machine in exchange for Cutler leaving the city. Kellogg loses the bet, and is instead re-assigned to ""Charlie Company"". Due to low manpower, Cutler enlists military squadmate Lori Barton  to assist his training. As the training goes on, Hatch steals a binder which contains details of tactics and information on the members. Meanwhile, Cutler starts a passionate relationship with Kim Byers , the Detroit PD's Psychiatrist. The phone calls from Hatch now increase and he kidnaps Kim after planting a bomb under Cutler's car and shooting a member of the S.W.A.T. team. The Captain orders Cutler to return to Los Angeles, where Hatch wouldn't be able to target him. The S.W.A.T. team is then called to a derelict warehouse where things do not appear to be right as no officers are on the scene. In the van, communication from the station shows that the call was a hoax. One S.W.A.T. officer is killed by a bomb while Barton and Watters are kidnapped. Aware of the full situation, Kellogg gives Cutler access to the armory and a squad car to save the hostages at one of the training grounds. Cutler briefly rescues Watters, but Watters perishes due to gunshot wounds to the chest from one of Hatch's henchmen. Cutler manages to save Barton and pursues Hatch. Cutler engages Hatch in a hand-to-hand fight while Kim tries to cut free from a bomb vest. She manages to escape it after Lori breaks the chain holding her with a shot from her sniper rifle, and throws it towards Hatch just as Cutler kicks him back into the wall. Cutler fires a shot, hitting the vest and detonating it, killing Hatch. Support arrives, with Cutler graduating the surviving members. Cutler asks Kim if she wants to go back to Los Angeles with him."

Anderson is deeply affected by the incident and upon his return to teaching, he is an alcoholic, emotionally disturbed and separated from his wife, Helen . Their daughter, Kate , lives with her mother Helen and has classes with her father, but does not respect him. The headmistress, Sarah Balham , loathes Anderson and clearly wants to get rid of him, but the National Union of Teachers does not allow her to fire him. She indirectly accuses him of bad teaching and bringing alcohol into school. When Anderson reads about violence in another school, he sends a memo advising all employees at the school about the high number of attacks on teachers and auxiliary staff annually. As a result, he is considered paranoid and delusional by everybody at the school. One day, after hours, Anderson is overseeing detention, in which he has placed his daughter. They argue over her use of a mobile telephone during the detention session - he slaps her in the face and immediately regrets it. Soon after, the protagonist notes some strange movements outside the school and discovers that the telephone lines are down. Standing by a closed window, a milkshake is thrown at him from outside and the words 'U R Dead' appear written in the milkshake. He advises security guard James , who seems uninterested. Meanwhile, another security guard  has been murdered by hoodies who locked him in a wheelie bin and set fire to it. Looking for his daughter, Anderson visits the school library, but after he leaves the librarian is confronted by two hooded characters, who murder her. Anderson finds his daughter smoking in the toilets with a boy  and headmistress Balham instructs them all to go home. Kate tells Balham that her father slapped her and Balham asks her to make a statement. Meanwhile, PE teacher Nicky  passes through the gymnasium and into the changing rooms, where she is attacked by four children wearing hoodies and carrying crowbars. Having left the building, Anderson goes to his car, but finds the dead security guard's torch on the ground in the car park. Meanwhile, Kate is writing her statement in the staff room. Balham realises she can finally sack Anderson and, unable to use the telephone, calls security guard James to ensure that the teacher does not re-enter the school, and Helen, to inform her of the assault. Balham subsequently finds a body and escapes two attackers herself, only for them to kill her before she can call the police. Anderson then discovers her corpse, her face badly disfigured. He tries to call the police, but when an attacker enters the room, he hides, abandoning the phone, which the attacker crushes. Leaving the building, Kate is immediately chased back in by one of the attackers. Her boyfriend Eaves, who was waiting outside, enters the building to look for her. She comes across a member of auxiliary staff , who is unaware of the situation in the school and goes after the attackers, but is electrocuted immediately after discovering Eaves, who is wrapped in barbed wire. Anderson and James team-up to find Kate, who has left a 'Help' note in view of a CCTV camera. They discover Nicky struggling along a corridor, but she has been badly mutilated. Finding the room in which Kate is hiding, they are confronted by a hoodie and in a moment of cowardice, James locks the door with Anderson inside. Meanwhile, the police arrive and enter the school. A female police officer is pushed down a flight of concrete stairs by one of the hoodies and the other policeman is hit with a crowbar in the face. The attackers then find James, who tries to escape but is cornered by the youths. Anderson finds Kate, but one of the hooded attackers catches Anderson and Kate off guard, and an attack towards Anderson is deflected and Kate ends up getting stabbed and wounded. Anderson manages to overpower the attacker and grabs the knife and stabs him multiple times, then picks up his daughter and rushes out of the building. However, when they reach his car, they spot Helen's car in the carpark and realise that she has arrived at the school. Anderson has to decide in an instant whether to save his daughter's life by driving her to hospital, or to save Helen by re-entering the school. Logically, saving Kate by driving her to the hopital is more feasible rather than leaving her in the car where she could be attacked again or end up dying from her wound. And there would be no guarantee that he would be able to find Helen alive. So he puts Kate in the back seat of the car and drives her to the hospital.

After slaying a Chimera that attacks his village, Perseus takes Helius to the Mount of Idols, so they can speak to Zeus, but the dying Poseidon arrives instead. He informs Perseus that Hades and Ares are holding Zeus prisoner in Tartarus, and tells him to meet with his demigod son Agenor  to find the fallen god Hephaestus, who knows the way into Tartarus. Poseidon then gives Perseus his Trident before succumbing to his injuries, passing away, and crumbling into dust. Perseus flies on Pegasus to the campsite of Queen Andromeda's army. The queen is the princess Perseus saved a decade ago; Andromeda  has imprisoned Agenor for stealing crown jewels, but Perseus negotiates his release by asking the reluctant Agenor to come along in their plan. Perseus, Andromeda, Agenor, and a group of soldiers set out at sea to find Hephaestus, with Agenor explaining that Hephaestus created the three great weapons that Zeus, Hades, and Poseidon wield: Zeus’ Thunderbolt, Hades' Pitchfork, and Poseidon's Trident, and that together they form the Spear of Triam, the only weapon that can defeat Kronos. Agenor uses Poseidon's trident to direct the boat to Hephaestus's island, where they encounter three Cyclopes: Brontes, Steropes, and Arges, who attack them. When Perseus shows them the trident, they lead the group to Hephaestus , the smith god. He explains that he has a map to navigate the path though a deathly long labyrinth leading deep into Tartarus. He leads them to the door to the Labyrinth, where they are attacked by Ares, who found them after one of the soldiers, Korrina , prayed to him. Ares is jealous of Perseus' honor from his own father Zeus and kills all of the soldiers while Hephaestus opens the door and then sacrifices himself so that Perseus, Andromeda, and Agenor can enter the door before it closes. Agenor tries to use the map to direct them, but the Labyrinth continually shifts and at one point nearly crushes them. Perseus gets cut off from the group and encounters and kills the Minotaur before finding that he is in the exit of the labyrinth to Tartarus. Eventually, the group manages to reunite and find Kronos becoming powerful. Meanwhile, Zeus has been almost entirely drained of power as Kronos starts to awaken. Zeus apologizes to Hades for banishing him to the Underworld and asks his forgiveness, as he has forgiven Hades for his actions. Though initially surprised, Hades has a change of heart and decides to help Zeus and stop Kronos, but Ares is still angry with his father and Perseus intervenes. Perseus arrives and uses the Trident to free Zeus. As they are escaping, Ares throws the Pitchfork into Zeus's back, thus mortally wounding Zeus. To escape the charging Kronos, Perseus and Zeus use their powers to teleport them back to the Tiryns pass, where battle plans are made. Perseus, Andromeda and Agenor carry a weakened Zeus down to the base of the mountain where Andromeda's army is gathered.

Inside, a woman is seen viciously murdered and partially dissected in the bath tub. As the killer, Keech , washes his hands, a baby starts to cry. Keech approaches the baby. Despite the savagery of his attack on the woman he is surprisingly gentle with the baby, comforting him and saying, “she can't hurt you anymore”. The movie jumps forward 11 years to April 17, 2011. Investigative reporter Lewis Hicks  is struggling with a failing marriage with his wife Gina ; a dubious relationship with short time girlfriend, District Attorney Felecia Carson  and a slumping career. When Hicks pays a surprise visit to Felecia she becomes upset when she sees he is still wearing his wedding band. She tells him she is ending the relationship due to his unwillingness to make a commitment. Later that day Keech attacks Felecia in her home, expressing anger over a case she was involved in concerning a child being abused and murders her. Lewis arrives at Felecia's home but she is already dead and partially dissected similar to the woman in the opening scene. Lewis spots the killer and chases him into an alley where they fight. Lewis is knocked down but the killer drops a book. The killer is seen checking a pocket watch then disappears. Lewis finds the book, which he discovers to be the killer's journal. Lewis takes the journal home and reads about Felecia's killing, as well as 2 more murders that the killer plans within the next 72 hours. He writes the other two names down, but the killer arrives inexplicably at his home and takes the journal back as well as the sheet of paper with the other two names. Lewis tries to explain to the police investigating Felecia's murder but the lead detective  doesn't believe him and actually suspects Lewis of the killing. Lewis discovers that he can read the names of the other two women due to the impression left by the pen on the second sheet. He tracks down the second woman: a school teacher named Vicki Ihrling . He wants to keep an eye on her and pretends to ask her for a date, but she changes her mind instead going to a local bar. At the bar she is approached by Keech. As they make small talk she tells him she is a teacher, he states he knows one of her former students, an orphan boy that was returned to a boys' home after a teacher at the school reported him for abusing a stray cat. Vicki becomes nervous when she realizes she is the teacher that made the report and excuses herself to the restroom. In the restroom she is attacked by Keech. Lewis is able to trace Vicki to the bar but again arrives too late, finding her murdered also. When Lewis tries to catch Keech, Keech disappears out a window. The police still doubt his story about the killer, Lewis' only evidence is a small piece of the killer's coat torn off during the earlier fight and a bloody fingerprint on a newspaper clipping. He sends both to a friend at a local crime lab. When he follows up she tell him the preliminary results from the DNA test on the blood only show one result. An 11-year old orphan living in a local boys' home. She also shows him that the fabric of the coat reacts to heat, a quality she has never seen before in a fabric. Believing that the killer may be a relative of the boy Lewis goes to the home and introduces himself to the director Polly  as a mentor for big brother program; asking to meet the boy. Polly seems hesitant as the boy has had behavioral problem and been returned by several foster families, but agrees to let Lewis meet him. She introduces Lewis to the orphan, James Keech . James seems to distrust all adults and especially dislikes the nuns at the home  and is at first unreceptive to Lewis but agrees to go to the zoo. At the zoo Lewis asks James what he would like to be when he grows up, James seems unsure, but says he is good with math and would like to be an inventor, maybe even making a time machine so he could go back and fix his life. Back at the home James tells Lewis he wants to show him something, promising him to secrecy. Lewis promises and James shows him his 'private zoo'; a box with several small animals, including a mouse, a frog and a dragonfly that are all dead and partially dissected similar to the murder victims. Lewis is shocked and James becomes very upset, yelling at him to leave. Polly hears the yelling and comes into the dorm where James angrily accuses Lewis of trying to molest him. Polly does not believe the accusation as James has a history of making similar claims. Lewis starts to tells Polly about the dead animals but James angrily shouts that he promised not to tell. Lewis decides not to say anything and leaves. Lewis deduces that the killer is not a relative of James but rather James himself, having traveled back from the future to 'fix his life'. As Lewis continues to try to stop the killer he tries to find the third woman from the journal. The evidence leads him back to the boys' home. While talking to Polly he sees her college degree on the wall and realizes she is the third woman on the killer's list, with Polly being a nickname. Lewis is arrested at the boy's home and taken to the police station. At the police station he tries to explain but the police still do not believe him. Keech arrives pretending to be Lewis' lawyer. During a private conference he reveals to Lewis that his theory is correct, showing Lewis the pocket watch from the alley revealing it to actually be a time machine, and that he is James from the year 2032 coming back to fix his life. James uses the time machine to transport Lewis and himself to the boys' home, where he has Polly tied up on the roof. Keech demands that Lewis get the younger James from his room, threatening to kill Polly if he doesn't. Lewis quietly enters the dorm and prepares to kill the younger James hoping to set the time-line right, but can't bring himself to kill the sleeping child. Instead, he hides James inside a restroom, and goes to the roof. Keech explains that the woman from the opening scene was his mother who was abusive so he killed her, and he has been traveling through time, killing other people in an effort to set his life right. Meanwhile James leaves the bathroom and follows Lewis to the roof. James sees his older self and asks Keech if he is his father, but Keech tells him the truth about being his future self. James gets upset that Keech plans to hurt Polly, stating she has been nice to him, but Keech tells James that Polly is about to find his “private zoo” and will send him to a mental hospital where his abuse continues. While on the roof Keech reveals two more inventions: the small tazer like device from the opening scene is revealed to actually be a cutting torch, and the knife is shown to be an advanced motorized weapon with the serrated edge cycling like a chainsaw. During the struggle Keech drops the knife which James picks up and uses to slash Keech's leg. Keech then pushes James away but accidentally knocks him off of the roof. Keech turns to kill Lewis but as James dies from the fall Keech disappears. During the closing scenes Lewis is seen driving. Using a voice over he explains that since James died at age 11 the time line was 'made right' and he never became the serial killer. Each of the killer's victims is shown to still be alive including James himself. We see Lewis driving past the rundown house from the beginning of the movie which we now know to be James's mother's house. James comes out the front door to take out the trash. The movie closes with Lewis going home to his wife and son.

He gets hold of the pen-drive that contains several photos, where ingredients used as cattle feed at their farm are declared as no feed. The beginning of the scheme is traced back to Ukraine. Accompanied by Anjali, Akhilan sets out to solve the mystery. They get her friend, Ashok’s help but he is subsequently killed. The photos are revealed to be athletes who were competing for the Unified Nations in the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. The athletes are declared dead in a plane crash. The investigation leads them to the army medical research centre. The truth is then revealed that Energion was originally an undetectable steroid invented by Ramachandran to improve the performance of the athletes at the world games. Though the country performed well, some of the athletes began suffering from similar health problems leading to their deaths and that their death from a plane crash was faked to avoid national shame. They also learn that the adulterant in Energion could be detected only with the addition of ionization enhancer. After being assaulted by a local mafia led by Dinesh, Akhilan takes the remedial ingredients back to India. Once they are in India, Ramachandran is exposed and is about to be arrested. Akhilan requests his father to surrender but however, he discovers his father’s ugly side and finds out that he and his brother are just a result their father’s failed experiment.

At the beginning of their trek, they are given shelter by a Korean couple, who have a young son Han . While Han is hiding in nearby hills, the North Korean captors who are pursuing the three escapees kill the couple. The three Americans elude the North Korean pursuers and encounter Han with his companion dog Lobo , an abandoned K-9 corps police dog.American Movie Classics  http://movies.amctv.com/person/23769/Flame-the-Dog/overview While eating some of their few K-rations, which the three shared with Han and the dog, the three Americans discuss whether they should bring Han and the dog with them on their trek to the American lines. Brent, is in favor of bringing them along and, as ranking officer, orders the other two to do so. Kane, opposes bringing the boy and the dog because of the drain they posed on their few rations. Kane appeals to Wilson to out-vote Brent, based on the assertion that after being held captive rank no longer mattered. Wilson, showing no conviction either way, sides with Kane. However, they eventually agree with Brent and the five proceed on the trek. Along the way. Han confides with Kane that he doesn’t like him because Kane didn’t help save his parents against the North Koreans. Kane convinces Han that there wasn’t anything they could do as escaped prisoners with no weapons. Kane befriends Han and leads him to believe that he could be adopted and go to America. Cpl John Estway , a fourth escaped prisoner who was brainwashed, is encountered on their trek. He is carrying a two-way radio recovered from a broken-down Jeep, but the batteries that powered it have been depleted. They agree the radio would be useful in summoning help, if they could find replacement batteries. While traveling through brush, Wilson, who is in the lead, steps on a land mine and is killed. Han, starts to return to the three remaining men, but is prevented from stepping on a second land mine by the dog Lobo, who is able to sense it through smell. They decided Lobo would be a valuable resource and used him to sniff out more land mines along their path. After running out of K-rations, they decided to split up in search of food. Han discovers a wild pig in a thicket, which Kane captures and kills. While discussing how to cook it, someone suggested that they first skin it. Han asks if they have pigs in America and says you don’t skin a pig but rather roast it whole over an open fire. After doing so and enjoying a wonderful meal, they muse about how bright Han is for a child that they figure to be 9 or 10 years old. They come upon a grass-thatched farmhouse and wonder whether it is occupied. Upon seeing a radio antenna on the roof they surmise that they might find batteries for their radio inside. They hesitated to approach the house because enemy North Koreans might occupy it. Han suggests that he should go and ask for food under the assumption that the enemy, if there, would take him as an innocent child. The men were amazed about how clever and brave the boy was and agreed to his plan. There were enemy soldiers inside, but they reacted violently to the presence of the boy. They came out, shot the boy in a leg and searched for the suspected escapees. Two of the enemies approached the three hidden Americans, who ambushed them. Kane and Estway, donned the fallen enemy’s uniforms and pretended to hold Brent under arrest. The three approached the other North Korean soldiers and when they got close, they opened fire and killed them all. The wounded boy meanwhile fled to escape the North Koreans. After finding batteries in the farmhouse, they made radio contact with a nearby American base, who sent a helicopter to pick them up. They searched for Han, but couldn't find him immediately. The helicopter arrived but the three prisoners of war wouldn't leave without the boy. The helicopter pilot informed them they he could only carry two of them at a time and insisted that two of them get aboard. Eventually Estway got aboard alone and the helicopter flew away. The other two continued to search for Han. The helicopter pilot returned shortly under gunpoint of Estway and dropped a note saying that Han was spotted in the next canyon, which was infiltrated by many enemy soldiers and would soon be under barrage by American forces. Brent and Kane hiked to that canyon and spotted Han, but were caught under fire by both sides. In the process, the dog Lobo was fatally shot and Brent was wounded in the knee. They reached Han and shortly later were rescued by American infantrymen. After being transported to the American base camp, they were charged with disobeying orders to board the helicopter and Estway was charged in holding the pilot at gunpoint. Kane, however insisted on explaining the entire situation to the commanding colonial who finally agreed they were really heroes. The commander discovers that Han is only seven years old and marvels about how young and brave he is. Kane tells Han that he still has two years left to his hitch and won’t be able to adopt Han and take him to America. However, Kane convinces both the boy and Brent, that Brent should adopt the boy since Brent would be returning to America, because of his wound. Han leaves with Brent to the hospital and Kane is left displaying a feeling of accomplishment at the end.

The three approached the other North Korean soldiers and when they got close, they opened fire and killed them all. The wounded boy meanwhile fled to escape the North Koreans. After finding batteries in the farmhouse, they made radio contact with a nearby American base, who sent a helicopter to pick them up. They searched for Han, but couldn't find him immediately. The helicopter arrived but the three prisoners of war wouldn't leave without the boy. The helicopter pilot informed them they he could only carry two of them at a time and insisted that two of them get aboard. Eventually Estway got aboard alone and the helicopter flew away. The other two continued to search for Han. The helicopter pilot returned shortly under gunpoint of Estway and dropped a note saying that Han was spotted in the next canyon, which was infiltrated by many enemy soldiers and would soon be under barrage by American forces. Brent and Kane hiked to that canyon and spotted Han, but were caught under fire by both sides. In the process, the dog Lobo was fatally shot and Brent was wounded in the knee. They reached Han and shortly later were rescued by American infantrymen. After being transported to the American base camp, they were charged with disobeying orders to board the helicopter and Estway was charged in holding the pilot at gunpoint. Kane, however insisted on explaining the entire situation to the commanding colonial who finally agreed they were really heroes. The commander discovers that Han is only seven years old and marvels about how young and brave he is. Kane tells Han that he still has two years left to his hitch and won’t be able to adopt Han and take him to America. However, Kane convinces both the boy and Brent, that Brent should adopt the boy since Brent would be returning to America, because of his wound. Han leaves with Brent to the hospital and Kane is left displaying a feeling of accomplishment at the end.

He tries to kill them and eventually they escape in the car opening the title. Then it turns to be that Ram enjoys a successful career in information technology. He is hit by Radhi  as office romance. He turns down her interest and reveals he is in love with a girl who resides in Bangalore and he is going to visit her. Ram drives to Bangalore and meets Charu  in her apartment. While sleeping, Ram wakes up goes to the streets, search and kills a person . Eventually its revealed that Charu is in some danger and Ram is safeguarding her by not letting her out of that apartment until he cleans up the city for her safety. Ram's CEO Latha  comes to India from the USA and is also engaged to a guy names Vicky. Latha begins to ask her PA Chandru ([[Santhanam  to find out more about Ram. Charu then asks Chandru to convince Ram to give her lift home, which then ram agrees to. As Ram and Latha are driving home, they are followed by a red lorry, which attempts to kill both Ram and Latha. Ram manages to push Latha off the car as well as saving himself. Ram is seriously hurt and is taken to the hospital by Latha. Latha then speaks to the doctor, her uncle . Latha explains the doctor that she knows Ram personally and doesn't understand why Ram doesn't recognize her. Ram being unconscious, begins to mutter Charu's name. While Ram and Charu's uncle are having a brief conversation, Latha listens in. It is revealed that Ram and Charu used to work together for a competition and Ram fell in love with Charu from the moment that he met her. It came to a situation where Charu goes to a club to meet a work friend after having found out that her laptop data had been corrupted and she is unable to reach her work. She goes to the club to get a USB backup of her laptop data, before having been teased by drunk guys. These two guys happen to be the two guys Ram tries to kill at the beginning of the film. Charu goes to the police station to report the two guys who teased her, however, the guys did not take this well and threaten Charu. Ram witnesses this and assumes that there is a problem, however, Charu ensures Ram that he has nothing to worry about and that everything has been sorted. On the day of the competition, Ram and Charu go through their presentation, to make sure that they have got everything that they need. Ram looks behind him and notices that he has forgotten something. He explains to Charu that he needs to go back, but will be back in time for the competition. Charu being hesitant at first eventually agrees. Ram went back to get the gift that he has bought Charu, so that he can give to her when he proposes his love for her, after the competition. Ram then manages to go the competition venue on time, however, sees the two guys who teased Charu inside the venue. Ram jumps to the conclusion that the guys have come after Charu and are here to kill her. Ram tries to find them however fails. Ram then reaches the balcony where he witnesses Charu being taken into a car by two guys, which he assumes are the two teasers. Ram then runs after the car but then loses the car and is pushed on the side of the road, where he becomes delusional. He then goes home, and waits for Charu without changing his clothes or having a shower. He sits in one position for two days. Charu then comes home safe and sound, and is revealed to the doctor that him and Charu have been together ever since. The doctor comes out of the room to see a shocked Latha. Latha then reveals to her uncle  that her family know her as Latha, but she introduced herself to Ram as Charu, as her name was indeed Charulatha. Latha then reveals what actually happen; Ram went to get the present, while she was left to handle the presentation herself, and ends up winning the whole competition, Her father was a main judge on the competition and was also revealed that this competition was built to see how Charu can handle a whole business and would take over from her father. It was then revealed that Ram would not get a position in this company at all, and with Charu feeling guilty, she calls after Ram, which Ram hears and sees. She was taken into the car by her father which made it look like she was being kidnapped to Ram. The doctor then persuades Latha to act like the Charu that she was while living with him. At first she disagrees, however, after Ram gains his consciousness, Ram receives a call from a so called 'Charu'. Latha goes back to Bangalore, where she visits the woman who is acting as Charu to Ram over the phone. It is revealed that a blind woman acts as Charu, only because Ram keeps calling her and asking about her and refuses to believe that this isn't Charu's number. Latha then breaks into her old Bangalore home, and spies on Ram, with her uncle assisting her. Ram comes home and assumingly hugs a so called Charu. We then realise that it isn't actually Charu he is hugging, but he is hugging nothing but an empty space. Latha then asks her uncle what had happened to Ram. Ram is suffering from severe delusions and is imagining that Charu is still present with him, hence the reason why Ram didn't recognise her in the first place. The only way these delusions would go, is if Latha acts as if she was Charu, back in Banglore. Latha then acts as Charu and begins falling in love with Ram. Ram then explains to her that they are going to get married soon. They then reach a temple, where Charu and Ram are meant to be getting married. Latha had planned with her uncle and Chandru a fake killing so that Ram's delusions can leave him, which fails. Latha is then genuinely kidnapped by two guys, who are her so known fiance's friends. It is revealed that her fiance Vicky, is in fact gay and his friends can not accept Vicky getting married to any girl who gets in his way which includes Latha. The two guys attempt on killing Latha but is defeated by Ram. Ram then attempts to save Latha by taking her to the hospital but is then hit on the head. Ram gains his consciousness and goes home and waits for Charu at home, sitting in a position for two days, waiting for Charu. The delusion he sees is Charu coming back to him, in tears and saying that she is alright. Ram bursts into tears and goes to have a shower so that he can relax and start over with Charu. Latha however is still in hospital with her father and uncle by her side. Her uncle reveals that it was him who hit Ram on the head, so that he can take Latha to the hospital to get her checked out, yet he explains to Charu that she better of with Ram as he will keep her happy. Latha's father agrees and Latha insists that she goes to Ram. Latha then goes home to Ram, who still believes that Charu has come home long before. The film ends with Latha raising her arms asking for a hug from Ram, which Ram smiles and gives her.

Separated from his wife, his life revolves around his close friendship with his much younger flatmate Steve  and a passion for climbing. One summer, the pair and their loose gang of workers gain illicit, cash-in-hand employment painting the electricity pylons of the Yorkshire Moors. Their deadline is tight and their terms of employment precarious, but both are grateful for money and the opportunity to climb daily. The pattern of life is interrupted by the arrival of footloose Australian backpacker Gerry . Attractive, and a talented climber, she and Ray fall in love and become a couple despite Steve's apparent interest. Ray harbours some reluctance at Gerry's wild ways, but manages to overcome these to propose marriage. Gerry too is doubtful that her wandering days are over, and wonders if she can live the staid existence on offer, despite her love for Ray. Things come to a head when she and Steve, both clearly affected by the backpacking bug, are caught drinking vodka atop a tall pylon. Abseiling recklessly to face an angry Ray, she and Steve are fired on the spot. In a confronation, Gerry tells Ray that she cannot commit to the relationship, nor be tied down. Meanwhile, Ray's friendship with an increasingly jealous Steve is also in trouble, and the younger man moves out of the flat, planning his own travels to India. He and Gerry have a brief sexual encounter, but back out when they recognise the wrongs of their actions. Gerry waits on Ray's doorstep, hoping for some form of reconciliation, but is rejected. Upset, and undertaking a solo rock climb, she falls and is hospitalised with serious injuries. As Ray is being told this by an emotional Steve, the pylons are electrified as Ray's gang are still at work, and the crew are lucky to escape without electrocution. This heralds the end of the summer's work, and their elusive paymaster Derek, the electricity company official, arrives on the scene. He is apologetic at the mistake, but cannot say when the workers will receive their pay. The film ends on an uncertain note, with Steve departing for India, a recovered Gerry deciding to return to Australia, and Ray left standing on the Moors contemplating his scant options.

The family belongs to the urban upper middle-class and the couple is on the verge of separation. Simin wants to leave the country with her husband and daughter, as she does not want Termeh to grow up under the prevailing conditions. This desire is not shared by Nader. He is concerned for his elderly father, who lives with the family and suffers from Alzheimer's disease. When Nader decides to stay in Iran, Simin files for divorce. The family court judges the couple's problems insufficient to warrant divorce and rejects Simin's application. Simin leaves her husband and daughter and moves back in with her parents. On the recommendation of his wife, Nader hires Razieh, a young, deeply religious woman from a poor suburb, to take care of his father while he works at a bank. Razieh has applied for the job without consulting her hot-tempered husband Hodjat, whose approval, according to tradition, would have been required. Her family is financially dependent on the work, and she takes her daughter to the house with her. Razieh soon becomes overwhelmed by taking care of Nader's father, which is physically and emotionally demanding. On the first day of work, when she finds that the old man is incontinent, she phones a religious hotline to ask if it would be a sin for her to clean him. Assured that it would be acceptable, she continues in the job, but later hopes to get her husband into the position, without revealing that she had first worked there. She finds the work very heavy, especially as she is pregnant. Nader interviews Hodjat and hires him, but Hodjat, who is heavily in debt, is jailed by his creditors on the day he is due to start, and so Razieh returns to work for Nader. Whilst Razieh is cleaning, Nader's father wanders out of the apartment. Razieh runs to find him, and sees him at a newsstand from across a busy road. The next day, Nader and Termeh return to an empty house. Termeh discovers her grandfather lying unconscious on the floor in his bedroom, with one of his arms tied to the bed. When Razieh returns, an argument ensues between her and Nader. He tells her to leave after accusing her of having stolen money from his room . Razieh returns to protest her innocence, and to request her payment for the day's work. Outraged, Nader shoves Razieh out of the apartment. She falls in the stairwell and hurries out of the building. Hodjat's sister later calls Simin to inform her that Razieh is in the hospital, and they discover that she has suffered a miscarriage. A court is assigned to determine the cause of the miscarriage and Nader's potential responsibility for it. If it is proved that Nader knew of Razieh's pregnancy and caused the miscarriage, he could be sentenced to one to three years imprisonment for murder. Much of the film revolves around this issue. Nader accuses Razieh of neglecting his father. The hot-headed and aggressive Hodjat physically confronts Nader on several occasions, and threatens him, his family, and Termeh's teacher, who testifies on Nader's behalf. When Hodjat is sent out of a court hearing for an outburst, Razieh reveals that he is deeply depressed, and that he is taking antidepressants for these issues. Nader learns from Razieh's young daughter that the reason she was absent the day Nader came home early was because she had gone with Razieh to see a doctor, which Razieh had avoided revealing earlier. This news, combined with Hodjat's explosive temper, causes Nader to wonder if Hodjat is physically abusive to Razieh and had caused her miscarriage. Termeh protects her father with a false statement and Simin, fearing for her daughter's safety, attempts to arrange a financial deal with Razieh and Hodjat, to compensate them for the loss of their unborn child. Nader is initially outraged by Simin's suggestion that they pay Razieh and Hodjat, as he feels that it would be an admission of guilt. The morality of all of the characters is called into question as it is revealed that Nader lied about his knowledge of Razieh's pregnancy, and that Razieh has serious doubts as to whether Nader's actions caused the miscarriage. After Razieh had seen Nader's father at the newsstand, she was hit by a car in an attempt to protect him from being hit . Later that same night, she began to experience great pain, likely the beginning of her miscarriage. At one point, Simin plans to come back and live with Nader, knowing that she cannot go anywhere as long as her daughter still stays here. However, after another full-blown argument, Simin changes her mind and forces Termeh to leave with her. Nader tells Termeh that if she does think that he is guilty, she can leave and he will agree to paying Razieh and Hodjat. Termeh slightly hesitates but leaves anyway. Eventually, everyone, including Hodjat's creditors, meets at the home of Razieh and Hodjat to consummate the payment. Nader, still wary about the true cause of Razieh's miscarriage  writes the check and, knowing that Razieh is deeply religious, slyly says he will give it to Hodjat, on the condition that Razieh swears on the Qur'an that his actions were the cause of her miscarriage. Despite Hodjat's urgings, Razieh cannot bring herself to swear, as she believes it will be a sin that could endanger their daughter. Totally dejected, Hodjat breaks down, hits himself violently and storms out of his home—Nader withholds the money. Nader, Simin, and Termeh leave the house and find their car's windshield broken by an unknown culprit . The last scene is at the family court, and the three: Nader, Simin, and Termeh, are wearing black, indicative in Persian culture of a death in the family, implying that Nader's father has died. The couple file for a divorce once again, despite Nader no longer having to take care of his father. The judge makes their separation permanent, and asks Termeh about which parent she chooses to live with. She tearfully says that she has made a decision, but asks that the judge tell her parents to wait outside in the hallway before she tells him. Nader and Simin are shown waiting silently and separately in the hallway, on opposite sides of a glass partition, and the credits roll.

Over the course of three days we see her struggle with dementia and with the lack of power that comes with old age, while looking back on defining moments of her personal and professional life, on which she reminisces with her  husband, Denis Thatcher. She is shown as having difficulty distinguishing between the past and present. A theme throughout the film is the personal price which Thatcher has paid for power. Denis is portrayed as somewhat ambivalent about his wife's rise to power, her son Mark lives in South Africa and is shown as having little contact with his mother, and it is implied that Thatcher's relationship with her daughter Carol is at times strained. In flashback we are shown Thatcher's youth, working in the family grocery store in Grantham, listening to the political speeches of her father, whom she idolized - it is also hinted that she had a poor relationship with her mother, a housewife - and announcing that she has won a place at the University of Oxford. She remembers her struggle, as a young lower-middle class woman, to break into a snobbish male-dominated Tory party and find a seat in the House of Commons, along with businessman Denis Thatcher's marriage proposal to her. Her struggles to fit in as a ""Lady Member"" of the House, and as Education Secretary in Edward Heath's cabinet are also shown, as are her friendship with Airey Neave , her decision to stand for Leader of the Conservative Party, and her voice coaching and image change. Further flashbacks examine historical events during her time as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom including the rising unemployment related to her monetarist policies and the tight 1981 budget , the Brixton Riots of 1981, the miners' strike of 1984–5, and the bombing of the Grand Hotel during the 1984 Conservative Party Conference, when she and Denis were almost killed. We also see  her decision to retake the Falkland Islands following the islands' invasion by Argentina in 1982, the sinking of the ARA General Belgrano and Britain's subsequent victory in the Falklands War, her friendship with Ronald Reagan and emergence as a world figure, and the economic boom of the late 1980s. By 1990 Thatcher is shown as an imperious but aging figure, ranting aggressively at her Cabinet, refusing to accept that the Community Charge  is regarded as unjust, and fiercely opposed to European Integration. Her deputy Geoffrey Howe resigns after being humiliated by her in a Cabinet meeting, Michael Heseltine challenges her for the party leadership and her loss of support from her Cabinet colleagues leaves her little choice but to resign as Prime Minister, about which she is shown as still angry and bitter twenty years later.

After the United Nations Security Council resolves to intervene militarily, Aladeen travels to the UN Headquarters in New York City to address the council. Shortly after arriving, he is kidnapped by Clayton, a hitman hired by his treacherous uncle Tamir. Tamir then replaces Aladeen with a mentally-challenged political decoy named Efawadh, whom he intends to manipulate into signing a document democratizing Wadiya and opening the country's oil fields for business. Aladeen escapes after Clayton accidentally burns himself to death, but his huge beard has been shaved off by Clayton, making him practically unrecognizable. He encounters activist Zoey , who offers him a job at her alternative lifestyle co-op. Aladeen refuses the offer and travels to New York's ""Little Wadiya"", located near the Marcy Avenue station, which is populated by refugees from his country. There, he encounters ""Nuclear"" Nadal, the former chief of Wadiya's nuclear weapons program and head procurer of women, whom Aladeen thought he had previously executed. Nadal explains that Wadiyan rebels infiltrated his intelligence unit, sending into exile all the people he had ordered to be executed. Wanting his old job back, Nadal promises to help Aladeen thwart Tamir's plot and regain his position as 'rightful' dictator, on condition that Aladeen makes him head of Wadiya's WMD program again. Aladeen agrees and accepts Zoey's job offer, as she is catering at the hotel where the signing is to occur. Aladeen grows closer to Zoey after she refuses his sexual advances and teaches him how to masturbate, and then falls in love with her while watching her boldly and passionately tell off a police officer. Turning around Zoey's struggling business, Aladeen begins imposing strict schedules on everyone, forming a personality cult around Zoey and intimidating an inspector into giving the store a good review. However, Aladeen's relationship with Zoey becomes strained after he reveals his true identity. After acquiring a new beard taken from a corpse, Aladeen infiltrates the hotel and tells Efawadh to leave. At the signing ceremony, he tears up Tamir's document in front of the UN delegation, and holds an impassioned speech praising the virtues of dictatorship, drawing unintended parallels to current issues within the United States. However, upon seeing Zoey in the room, he declares his love for her and, knowing Zoey's strongly-held views, vows to democratize his country and open up Wadiya's oil fields for business, but in a way where the general populace will benefit. Angry with Aladeen staying in power, Tamir attempts to assassinate him but Efawadh jumps in front of the bullet and survives as it is his job ""to be shot in the head"". A year later, Wadiya holds its first democratic elections, although they are rigged in favor of Aladeen . Afterwards, he marries Zoey, but is shocked when she crushes a glass and reveals herself to be Jewish. Scenes during the credits show Aladeen's convoy, now consisting of eco-friendly cars, visiting a reinstated Nadal, and later Zoey revealing in a television interview that she is pregnant with the couple's first child. Aladeen responds to the news by asking if Zoey is having ""a boy or an abortion""."

Soon, Xu Xian wakes up and tells his friends about being kissed by a beautiful girl, which only makes them laugh. After finding a victim of a bat demon, Fahai and Neng Ren leave the temple immediately to subdue the bat demon to avoid more casualties. Xu Xian came across them and offers a boat ride to the city. Susu starts thinking about the day she kissed Xu Xian and decides to head to the city to find Xu Xian. Meanwhile, while Qingqing is exploring the city, she came across Neng Ren and decided to help him subdue the bat demon by revealing its location. Neng Ren defeats the bat demon's cohorts, but is unable to subdue the bat demon king who bites him. Though he is subsequently saved by Fahai, Neng Ren starts turning into a bat demon himself the next day and decides to run away. In the meanwhile, after a series of pranks, Xu Xian recognizes Susu and they spend the night together, which is rather unfortunate for Xu Xian because he does not know that he was making love to a snake in a human form. Neng Ren is found by Quinqing and the two befriend each other. They realize that Neng Ren, despite becoming a bat demon, still has all his human taste for human food, and most of his human qualities. Meanwhile Xu Xian and Susu wed. Shortly thereafter Fahai finds Xu Xian and after seeing a mysterious substance in his medicines he gives Xu Xian a spirit blade. Susu is pursued by Fahai, who tells her to leave Xu Xian. She doesn't, which causes Fahai and his disciples to invade her and Xu Xian's cottage. Susu fights the battle in her snake form, but is stabbed by Xu Xian unaware of her true identity. Susu escapes...while Xu Xian decides that he must save her. Helped by Susu's friend, a mouse, Xu Xian manages to retrieve a root kept inside the Lei Feng Pagoda that could save Susu, but is possessed by demons as a result of this. Fahai and the other monks capture Xu Xian and prepare to cast spells to banish the demons from his body. Susu recovers and she goes to find Xu Xian along with Quinqing. They are confronted by Fahai, who tries to explain to them that the spell should not be broken before it is complete. But Susu misunderstands his intentions and the two sisters start battling Fahai. After countless wounds Fahai lies back exhausted. As he looks around he sees Neng Ren helping to save his former colleagues, the monks of the temple who were trying to complete the spell to release Xu Xian from the demons. He looks up at the sky and questions whether he was right to have been a demon hunter all his life. Susu releases Xu Xian from the spell after which Xu Xian does not have any memory of Susu. Susu blames this on Fahai, after which they have one last battle. Fahai manages to trap Susu in the temple of Lei Feng Pagoda. At this point, Susu repents and asks to see Xu Xian just one last time. Simultaneously, Fahai gets the answer to his question and understands what he must do. Filled with the divine spirit, he lifts up the pagoda to allow Susu's last wish to come true. After a brief reunion with Xu Xian, she tells him of her story of having meditated for a thousand years before she met him. She tells him that it was all worth less than a moment with him. She kisses him, causing him to remember everything. As the pair go to kiss one last time Susu is sucked back into the temple, leaving Xu Xian chasing her as both cry and reach out for each other. Qingqing, watching all this from a distance with Neng Ren, tells him that she doesn't want to love anyone as her sister loved Xu Xian, and leaves saying that he will never be a true bat demon anyway. After this, we see Xu Xian picking herbs around the temple and inside Susu has returned to her true form as a white snake trapped inside the temple. Fahai is seen walking the mountainside when suddenly Neng Ren  appears alongside him. Throwing him an apple to eat Fahai tells him that his new look suits him, and they continue on the journey together again.

Oskar Schell  is introduced as the son of German American Thomas Schell  who died during the attack. In a flashback Thomas and Oskar play a scavenger hunt to find objects throughout New York City. The game requires communication with other people and is not easy: ""if things were easy to find, they wouldn't be worth finding"". On September 11, Oskar is let out of school early while his mother Linda  is at work. When Oskar gets home, he finds five messages from his father on the answering machine saying he is in the World Trade Center. When Thomas calls for the sixth time, Oskar hears the phone ringing but is too scared to answer. The machine records a sixth message, which stops when the building collapses, and Oskar knows his father has been killed. He replaces the answering machine so his mother will never find out. A few weeks after what Oskar calls ""the worst day"", he confides in his German grandmother and they become closer. Oskar's relationship with his mother worsens since she cannot explain why the World Trade Center was attacked and why his father died. Oskar tells his mother he wishes it had been her in the building, not his father, and she responds, ""So do I"", after which Oskar says he did not mean it, but his mother tells him he did. A year later, Oskar finds a vase in his father's closet with a key in an envelope with the word ""Black"" on it. He vows to find what the key fits. He finds 472 Blacks in the New York phone book and plans to meet each of them to see if they knew his father. He first meets Abby Black , who has recently divorced her husband. She tells Oskar she did not know his father. One day, Oskar realizes that a strange man  moved in with his grandmother. Oskar stumbles upon the stranger who does not talk because of his childhood trauma of his parents' death in World War II. He communicates with written notes and his hands with ""yes"" and ""no"" written on them. As they become friends and go together on the hunt to find what the key fits, Oskar learns to face his fears, such as those of public transport and bridges. Oskar concludes that the stranger is his grandfather. Oskar plays the answering machine messages for the stranger. Before playing the last message, the stranger cannot bear listening any longer, and stops Oskar. Later on, the stranger moves out and tells Oskar not to search anymore. When Oskar looks at a newspaper clipping his father gave him, he finds a circled phone number. He dials the number and reaches Abby, who wants to take Oskar to her ex-husband, William, who may know about the key. William ([[Jeffrey Wright  tells Oskar he has been looking for the key. William had sold the vase to Oskar's father who never knew the key was in the vase. The key fits a safe deposit box where William's father left something for him. Disappointed that the key does not belong to him, Oskar goes home. Oskar's mother tells Oskar she knew he was contacting the Blacks. She then informs him that she visited each Black in advance and informed them that Oskar was going to visit and why. Oskar makes a scrapbook of his scavenger hunt and all the people he met and titles it ""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close."" At the end of the scrapbook there is an animation where the body is falling up instead of down. Oskar's grandfather returns to live with Oskar's grandmother."

Ned tells that five years ago, the Russian mobster Skinny Faddeev gave 30 million dollars in blood diamond in advance to Anton to lose a fight against his nephew. However, Anton killed the nephew with a punch and when Skinny was found dead, he was sentenced to life. While in prison, a girl name Lexie Persimmon wrote him over 200 letters. Later, however, Anton was released when another prisoner confessed to killing Skinny. Ned finds this suspicious. Now, Anton gives Ned the job of finding Lexie, whom he has taken a liking to. Ned is sceptical about his job, since he doesn't even have a photo of Lexie. As he starts investigating and finding various clues, people start dying mysteriously. Meanwhile, Ned also notices that a black Lincoln is following him and assumes that it is Russian mafia. Ned finds a lead that Lexie might be in San Celeritas, New Mexico. He meets a waitress named Fay Neman, a particle physics buff, who helps him. Ned meets Simon, his wife Julie and the geek physicist Niels Geck, who is conducting the experiment for Simon. Simon only has interest in finding the god particle and doesn't feel anything when Julie tries to warm up to Ned. Ned realizes that Julie may be Lexie and decides to tell her what is happening. Meanwhile, Anton tracks Ned down to Simon's bungalow. Ned confronts Julie, but Julie has no idea what he is talking about. Here, Ned and Julie hear gunshots, making Ned realize that Anton is there. Realizing that he and Anton both have mistaken Julie for Lexie, Ned tries to save her. When the duo head towards basement, Ned is astonished to find Niels dressed like a girl with a blonde wig. A box containing some cosmetics has the phrase ""Lex Parsimoniae"" printed on it. Ned realizes that Niels wrote the letters to Anton. Anton is angered, while Niels tries to convince Anton to accept him. Niels is armed to placate Anton. In a shootout that happens, Ned gets hurt and passes out. The story cuts back to present, where it is revealed that Niels and Anton killed each other, while the detectives have held Ned and Julie hostage. Ned accuses the trio of following him and killing the people he met. He also accuses that Skinny was killed for diamonds, which his killer never recovered. Ned proves that Frizer, who has a short temper, killed all the people who could have known about diamonds. Frizer admits his crimes, upon which the other villains scold him. Ned takes a look at a glass tank containing a gecko and realizes something. He tells the villains that he knows where Niels stored the diamonds. The villains take Ned and Julie to the spot where he had confronted Julie after she showed him a hidden shoebox. While Julie and Ned are in the car, Skeres and Frizer go to get the shoe box. Meanwhile, Poley spots Julie and Ned signalling each other and realizes that they are just playing around. He attacks them, but they overpower him and manage to drive the car towards Skeres and Frizer. Here, Skeres and Frizer are disappointed to not to find the diamonds in the box. When they see the car coming towards them, they realize what is happening and start shooting. Ned kills all the three villains. Meanwhile, Simon finds that Julie and Niels are both missing, but decides to start his final experiment. The experiment creates a rift on the ground. Simon dies, while Ned and Julie drive to safety, barely escaping certain death. In the end, Ned is shown driving the same car with Julie & Fay, whereupon it is revealed that the diamonds were in the glass box containing the gecko.

The Undefeated is the true story of General Roman Shukhevych  a genteel family man forced by brutal circumstances and his own sense of honor and duty to lead the fight to deliver his people from the savageries of both the Nazis and Soviets. Producer and director Oles Yanchuk, hailed by both the New York Times and Time Magazine for his heart-wrenching film, Famine-33, delivers an internationally renowned team of filmmakers and artists to bring to the screen the epic story of Roman Shukhevych. Set against the backdrop of an underground war, Yanchuk explores the complex character of Shukhevych, his revulsion at ethnic discrimination, his love of music, his genius in combat. The film smolders with the passion of the man and ignites the viewer with the same fire that Shukhevych fueled in his countrymen - the unquenchable flame of freedom. Filmed on location in the exotic and mysterious Carpathian Mountains, the tarnished but still opulent cities of Odessa and Kyiv, and the architecturally stunning city of Lviv, The Undefeated is a movie filled with explosive action and suspense. It is a personal story of faith and commitment and ultimately, the victory of freedom over tyranny.

The film smolders with the passion of the man and ignites the viewer with the same fire that Shukhevych fueled in his countrymen - the unquenchable flame of freedom. Filmed on location in the exotic and mysterious Carpathian Mountains, the tarnished but still opulent cities of Odessa and Kyiv, and the architecturally stunning city of Lviv, The Undefeated is a movie filled with explosive action and suspense. It is a personal story of faith and commitment and ultimately, the victory of freedom over tyranny.

30599547	/m/0gfg4bb	Frederick Douglass and the White Negro			52	{}	"{""/m/03rt9"": ""Ireland""}"	"{""/m/0jtdp"": ""Documentary""}"	 Frederick Douglass and the White Negro is a documentary telling the story of ex-slave, abolitionist, writer and politician Frederick Douglass and his escape to Ireland from America in the 1840s. The film follows Douglass' life from slavery as a young man through to his time in Ireland where he befriended Daniel O'Connell, toured the country spreading the message of abolition and was treated as a human being for the first time by white people. His arrival in Ireland coincided with the Great Famine and he witnessed white people in what he considered to be a worse state than his fellow African Americans back in the US. The film follows Douglass back to America where he buys his freedom with funds raised in Ireland and Britain. Fellow passengers on his return journey include the Irish escaping the famine who arrive in their millions and would go on to play a major role in the New York Draft Riot of 1863 which Douglass could only despair over. The film examines  the turbulent relationship between African Americans and Irish Americans during the American Civil War, what drew them together and what drove them apart and how this would shape the America of the twentieth century and beyond.

Michael Ransom  and his team of ""Strike Commandos"" are sneaking into a Vietnamese base, who are planning to lay explosives. Colonel Radek and Ransom's majors watch from a nearby vintage point. All prove to be successful, until one of the commandos are caught and killed by a sentry, rising the alarm. The commandos have no choice but to retreat, but Colonel Radek who is in charged of the mission demands the explosives be set off as the commandos are still retreating. One of the explosives kill one of Ransom's soldiers as he retreats, and Ransom is blown into a river. Ransom drifts unconscious in the river until he is found by a village boy, who treat and nurse him back to health. He speaks with Le Due  a retired French soldier who says the village used to be a church until the Viet Cong kept attacking. Ransom also learns that there is a Russian presence in Vietnam. Ransom agrees to take the Vietnamese village people to safety in a unknown location. As they come across a decomposed died soldier who has a radio, Ransom calls his home base and tells his commander that hes alive and where he could be picked up. However, he also says that the Strike team demands justice and that he will strike vengeance. Radek sends a helicopter to retrieve Ransom at a specific spot. Ransom and the village people make camp, as Ransom talks to the village boy who saved him about the wonders of America and Disneyland. The next day, the group run into resistance while trying to cross a river, and are shot down by a nearby patrol boat. Ransom decides to go into the river and take down the boat. However, the group is flanked by a group of VC's who are taken down by Le Due with a grenade. Ransom dumps a huge amount of grenades into the boat and kills everyone in the patrol boat. Later, the village people still make their retreat out of the jungle. While Le Due stops to catch his breath he is caught and choked to death by a Russian soldier. Ransom finds the corpse of Le Due and finds a Russian patch symbol torn from the soldiers uniform. The Russian soldiers are in search of the village people as Ransom kills them off one by one. Ransom soon discovers, however, that there are too many and that he must retreat. Radek commands the helicopter to retreat to base, but Ransom's major is able to talk the soldier into picking him up anyway. Ransoms major is able to calm Ransom so much so that Ransom volunteers to go back to take pictures of the base so that there will be proof of Russian presence in Vietnam. Ransom goes back to Vietnam but finds the village people have been slaughtered. Ransom finds the village boy that helped him in the beginning as he is dying. Ransom tells him more things about the amazing Disneyland, just as he dies. Ransom finds the name of the Russian soldier, Jakoda, and seeks revenge. Ransom mugs a VC and he tells him where to find Jakoda. Ransom, enraged, fires at the village with his stolen M60 machine gun. Jakoda finds Ransom reloading the weapon, but he is able to talk Ransom into surrendering by holding a civilian hostage. Ransom's superiors find out that there are Russians in there and that now he is going to be tortured. They brutally torture Ransom by having him do yard work, beating him, electrifying him, and buring his back with a blow torch. After spending months in a cell with a corpse, Ransom breaks and agrees to make a demoralizing radio broadcast. However, he is able to get the best of the Russian soldiers and kills them. Ransom takes Jakoda's girlfriend Olga  hostage, he is able to kill some of the soldiers using Olga as bait. He then radios Radek to bring another chopper to pick him up, and he kills more of the soldiers. When Ransom and Olga reach the pick up point, Olga says that they will not pick up Ransom but attempt to kill him. The helicopter flies by but kills Olga and almost kills Ransom. Ransom is able to gun down one of the gunmen and the helicopter retreats. Ransom then comes across an army boat and dives in to go kill some more soldiers. A VC sneaks up on him and strangles him, but Ransom is able to stab him and dives out when the ship explodes.

However, one of the generals finds out where Radek is hiding. Ransom finds out that Radek has actually become a importer/exporter in Manila. Ransom arrives at the building where Radek is at, and goes to the front desk lady. He then lays a 2-minute gernade on the ash tray on the desk. The lady then alerts all the people. Ransom roams the halls of the building using his M60 and mows down all the men. He then loads a grenade on his gun and fires at Radek, blowing him up.

He is first seen attacking protestors who are disrupting the work of a construction company with the other members of the organisation. Sang-hoon has a nephew, Hyung-in, whom he adores. His sister cares about him also, even inviting him to dinner. Hyung-in is on less friendly terms and avoids her. It is revealed that when he was a kid, his abusive father once had a quarrel with his mother and stabbed his sister by accident. His mother was then hit by a car. It is implied that his father has remarried. One day, after visiting his nephew, he accidentally spits on a high school student, Han Yeon-hee. She demands that he do something to make up for it. They get into a fight and he hits her, knocking her unconscious. When she wakes up, she realises that Sang-hoon was waiting for her to awake and has wiped her clothes clean. Undaunted by his ferocity, she demands compensation from him. He is intrigued by her spunk and they form a tenuous friendship. While Sang-hoon believes that Yeon-hee comes from a rich family, they have trouble paying the rent. Her father is a war veteran who has delusions that Yeon-hee's mother is still alive. Both her father and brother, Han Young-jae, frequently threaten and abuse her. Young-jae is recruited by his friend, a junior colleague of Sang-hoon's, to work as a debt collector for Man-shik. On his first day, he accompanies Sang-hoon and his friend on their rounds. He is hesitant and Sang-hoon berates him. One day, as Sang-hoon visits his father - recently released from prison for killing Sang-hoon's sister with a knife - his father has already cut his own wrists. It is then that he realises how much he still loves his father. That same day, Yeon-hee's father is even more paranoid and threatens her with a knife. Sang-hoon and Yeon-hee meet up for a drink and both weep, overcome with emotion. Sang-hoon tells Man-shik that it will be his last day as a gangster and invites him to meet Yeon-hee, his sister and Hyun-in. Man-shik also decides that he has had enough and wants to open a gogi gui restaurant. On his last day as a debt collector, he is doing the rounds with Young-jae. Young-jae beats a debtor against Sang-hoon's wishes, and the debtor responds by hitting Sang-hoon with a hammer. As Sang-hoon walks away with Young-jae, blood starts to flow out of his nose. He asks Young-jae for a handkerchief, but Young-jae attacks him with a hammer, and leaves him dying by the road. In the epilogue, it is strongly suggested that Sang-hoon died. Yeon-hee, Hyung-in, Sang-hoon's sister and father enjoy dinner together at Man-shik's newly-opened restaurant. On leaving, Yeon-hee sees her brother destroying a street-side food stall like her late mother's.

They are joined by rival reporters Eight O'Clock Faraday  and Billy Tuesday  along with cab driver Happy Codburn , to whom Faraday owes ""toity-five cents"" . The party grows by two when psychic Mrs. Cupcupboard  and ""stranded motorist"" Ray Vestinhaus  arrive unexpectedly. The large group gathers in the home's parlor so that lawyer Farper Twyly  can read the will. Before Twyly begins, the guests note the unusual threats surrounding the estate: Sabasha has been the subject of mysterious death threats; a serial killer known as the ""Cavinder Strangler"" is still at large and in the area; and it happens to be the same night on which the 300-year-old ghost of Sarah Cavinder is supposed to return. Twyly reads the will, revealing that some characters receive trivial gifts and other substantial ones. The bulk of the estate is given to Sabasha, but with the clause that upon her death the estate would then be given to Burling. Twyly then reveals the existence of an additional letter that amends the will; he discovers that it has been stolen, but assures the group that he and only he knows the contents. Before he can recite the letter, the lights are turned off. When they are turned back on, the group discovers that Twyly has been stabbed to death. When Ray tells the group that the only bridge back to town collapsed behind him, Faraday and Tuesday suggest that they all wait until morning for the police to arrive. However, at the stroke of midnight, Pristy is strangled by a masked killer. Dr. Van Von Vandervon  arrives and announces that he's tracked an escaped lunatic to the house, but because of the nature of his work , he is not sure what the patient looks like, or even if it's a man or woman. Over the course of the evening, the group attempts to find both the letter and clues leading to the killer. A seance is held by Mrs. Cupcupboard, but the spirit  is of no help. Mrs. Hausenstout occasionally pops up with a gorilla  in tow, and a police inspector  arrives--and is promptly killed. As the night progresses, Jack, Teak, Seyton and Dr. Von Vandervon are murdered, as is Archie the cook . Happy discovers a woman  locked in an attic room. Although the group assumes she is the ghost of Sarah Cavinder, the housemaid Jane  tells them that she is Thessaly, the confrontational and slightly insane daughter of Sinas Cavinder. Jane also knows the contents of the letter and tells Faraday and Tuesday that the letter makes Thessaly, not Sabasha, the inheritor of the estate. Faraday and Tuesday track down and confront the guilty parties--Burling and Sabasha, who began the night working independently but who later ""joined forces"" to knock off their rivals to the inheritance. Faraday and Tuesday also deduce that the real Sabasha is dead and that the woman pretending to be her is actually Dr. Von Vandervon's escaped lunatic. Burling threatens to blow up the house unless Faraday and Tuesday turn over the letter, but he is accidentally electrocuted after being confronted by Thessaly. Ray appears and admits that he is actually Bax Tremblay, a police investigator working undercover. He, Faraday, and Tuesday attempt to apprehend the false Sabasha, but she strangles herself to death to avoid capture. The next morning, Thessaly takes possession of the estate. Faraday proposes marriage to Tuesday and she accepts; the two of them agree to share their newspaper ""scoop."" They are driven away by Happy, who belatedly realizes that because he left the cab's meter running all night, Faraday owes him $87.42."

While he keeps on telling himself ""in the beginning was the word"" he gets to know the racketeer Mauricius (Anton Adassinsky, playing a wordly version of Mephistopheles, who eventually contradicts him: ""In the beginning was the deed"".

During a subsequent brawl Faust accidentally kills Gretchen's brother. Faust becomes obsessed with Gretchen who appears to embody the beauty of blooming life. He indulges himself in thinking that studying her would be reasonable as a part of his research about what makes all the difference between life and death. When the aging Faust has become irreversibly infatuated with Gretchen, Mephistopheles offers him to let him have her. Faust cannot resist the idea of spending a night with Gretchen. Yet Mauricius demands nothing less than Faust's soul in return. Faust even has to sign the contract with his own blood. Now living on borrowed time, Faust can hit on Gretchen but he is haunted by penitence and fear. Finally Faust cannot bear Mauricius' nihilistic comments anymore. Overwhelmed with wrath he puts Mauricius down and finds himself lost in the middle of nowhere."

30635557	/m/0g9_28j	Egaro				{}	{}	"{""/m/01z02hx"": ""Sports""}"	{{Plot}} Egaro celebrates the centenary of the historical football match between Mohun Bagan and East Yorkshire Regiment for the IFA Shield where Mohun Bagan snatched the shield on 29 July 1911 during a time when India was under British rule. Egaro is also the first celluloid tribute to the 11 Mohun Bagan players who won the shield, ten of them playing barefoot clad in folded dhotis with just one of them, Sudhir Chatterjee, wearing boots against a team with the right kit, boots, dress, infrastructural support and the typical bias of the White rulers against the coloured Ruled. But Egaro is not just about football. It is about the patriotic passion that drove these eleven players to unite thousands of Indians from the entire eastern regions who flocked in from Dhaka, Burdwan, Midnapore crossing barriers of caste, class, community and language to watch the players kick and beat up the British teams on the playing field without being punished by the rulers because it was all in the game. It is about the killer spirit where the killer took prominence not because it was a fight to finish, but because the final match was a battlefield where the winning could speed the movement against Imperial rule and towards freedom. It did, in a manner of speaking. After the historic win on July 29, 1911, the British felt pressurized enough to shift its capital from Calcutta to Delhi on December 12 the same year. The film explores a parallel theme of an underground revolution brimming underneath following the Partition of Bengal in 1905 and the hanging of Khudiram Bose for attempting to kill Kingsford in 1908. Nagendra  leads a group of young freedom fighters in a the fight to eliminate high-ranking British officers with indigenous bombs and fire-arms without harming the old, the women and the children. He castigates one of his revolutionaries, also a Mohun Bagan player, for paying more attention to football than to the revolution. But over time, he is convinced that this final match is no less than the revolution he is leading. He comes to the finals and motivates the same member he threw out to rise and play when he faints during the match felled by one of the many false kicks of the British team. Mohun Bagan had entered the finals after having vanquished strong teams of the British side such as Rangers, St. Xaviers and Middlesex which consolidated the team’s confidence that the British teams were not as unconquerable as they thought. East Yorkshire Regiment scored one goal before half-time sending the entire audience into a tizzy and depressing the home team. But after half-time, the team scored two goals one by Captain Sibdas Bhaduri and the other by Abhilash Ghosh, a striker. The preparation towards the final match spans a major slice of the film including family and personal hurdles the team members face. Abhilash is a student at Scottish Church College, along with teammate Rajen Sengupta. Abhilash’s father does not care about his brilliant son’s involvement in a game that might anger the British rulers. Abhilash himself begins to rethink his stance because football, he feels, has reduced his duties towards those he loves. Sudhir Chatterjee, professor in the London Missionary Society College is insulted in the staff room by his British colleagues for daring to participate in a match against a British team. The Principal suspends him indefinitely. But Shibdas is determined to win even if one or two of the team drop out at the last minute. They don't. Two British citizens prove that they too, are human. One of them is the match referee Puller who refuses to bend under pressure by the powers-that-be to treat the match as a ‘must-win-or-else’ ego trip against native Indians. The other is Piggot, a player of the Middlesex team who was badly injured in one eye by an inadvertent kick delivered by Abhilash. He gives Abhilash a clean chit though the officers who visit him at the hospital urge him to pronounce the Indian team player’s kick as intentional. Egaro is a sports film where reality has been cocktailed with elements of fiction. This makes the film more entertaining and exciting, filled with moments of suspense, hilarity, drama and a bit of romance thrown in delicately between Abhilash and Bina and the one-sided attraction his British colleague, the beautiful Elina feels towards her colleague Sudhir. Her reactions on the field where she sits on the British side and when Mohun Bagan scores each goal, she begins to fan herself rapidly to express her joy. The reactions of the audience provide a wonderful sense of relief and bonhomie and solidarity and patriotism bonded as one. Though three of the eight players are professional football players, their acting is beyond par and one cannot make the difference between the actors and the players. The cameos are wonderfully portrayed by renowned actors of Bengali cinema, theatre and television. The revolutionary segment is a bit overdrawn and dramatic at times. The tremendous violence by the police who kill revolutionary Satyen’s grandfather in prison could have been cut out. The flames of his pyre arousing flames of anger within his granddaughter Bina is a powerful touch. Gopi Bhagat’s cinematography in one word is brilliant. Indraneel Ghosh’s art direction reproduces the period with old mansions and homes with brick walls with the plaster peeling off, the roadside shop selling hot fritters, the college staff room, the prison cell with amazing accuracy. Mayukh-Moinak’s music is very good but the background score by Arijit Singh is a bit too loud drowning the ambient sounds and the dialogue at some places. The cheering audience in the theatre clapped each time a line was quoted from Swami Vivekananda, or, when the home team strikes a goal, or, at when Mohun Bagan’s name is mentioned as one with India and identified with the struggle for freedom. Sadly, this history does not find mention in the history of India’s struggle for independence sums up the voice-over aptly. The sub-titling in English widens the horizons of the audience for the film. One prays that this goes out to all the festivals and gets an organized premiere all over India in recognition of a brave band of eleven players who contributed to our freedom.

As they carry out a rudimentary and hurried burial, all the while they are unknowingly being watched by Cassie's 8 year old daughter, Amy . The story then jumps to eight months later. Cassie is struggling; her relationship with her two daughters, Amy and Hannah  is fractious. She is struggling to run her farm and her financial situation is so bad that she can no longer afford to pay Cooper. She is visited by a sinister neighbouring farmer, Karsten  who is eager to buy Cassie's farm and marry her, both of which Cassie declines. Enter Aden , an old friend of Dean's who was passing. Quick to cover up her secret, Cassie tells Aden that Dean left. Aden asks if he can stay the night and after some convincing from Amy, Cassie reluctantly concedes. The next day Aden persuades Cassie that he can be of use to her on the farm and Cassie allows him to stay on, much to the displeasure of Cassie's 16 year old daughter Hannah who immediately dislikes Aden, sussing out his intentions of getting ""into my mum's knickers"". Karsten's interest in Cassie escalates as his jealousy of Aden mounts. He throws around irrational threats, gloatingly kills one of Cassie's calves and builds a roadblock denying Cassie access to the outside world. This is the last straw and Aden tells Cassie that he will ""talk to Karsten"". But instead Aden kills Karsten and his brother, Noah  in cold blood. Life on Cassie's farm settles down as she believes that Aden had a strong word with Karsten and she quickly falls for him. Aden helps Cassie out with her finances, making a good deal on cattle feed and suggesting that she get rid of Cooper as he is costing too much. It's after the firing of Cooper that Hannah confronts Aden, knowing that what he really wants is to control the family. Aden enjoys her teenage bravado, and quickly retorts with his knowledge of Hannah's deepest secret: Dean's abuse of her. Stunned and hurt, Hannah flees the farm.

He is clearly deranged and Cassie walks him off her property at gunpoint making it clear that if he ever came back she would kill him. She tracks down Hannah and for the first time in a long time, mother and daughter connect. Hannah promises to return in the morning. That night, Cassie finds Dean's wedding ring amongst Aden's things. Spooked, she traipses back to Dean's unmarked grave with shovel in hand and digs up the grave only to find it empty. She contacts Cooper stating that ""there's no body"". The next morning Cooper and Cassie find her prized bull dead, throat slit. This is the last straw for Cassie and she marches up to Karsten's place determined to sell her holding to him, but what she finds is the rotting, fly-ridden bodies of Karsten and Noah, and Aden living in the house. Cassie tries to escape with Amy but Aden knocks her out and takes her and Amy back to the farm. As Cassie comes round, Aden confesses all: Dean was not dead, but escaped from the grave and fled back to the oil rigs - the only other place he knew. There he told Aden everything; the abuse of Hannah and his ""murder"". Aden tells Cassie of his disdain of the man who ""had everything and pissed it away"". Realising that she is now in the hands of a psychopath, Cassie tries to talk Aden round but all he wants is for them to be a family. The moment Hannah returns home, Aden locks Cassie and her daughters in Hannah's room. It is here where the truth comes out and for the first time, as mother and daughter talk about Dean's abuse. Cassie confesses that she tried to kill Dean when she found out about him abusing Hannah, but he escaped and went back to the rigs. Amy admits to seeing her mother bury her father's body. Now with all the secrets out in the open, the three of them bond and unite. What follows is Aden's attempt at playing ""happy families"", and the girls attempt at ridding themselves of Aden. Together they manage to lure him to the slurry pit. Little Amy surprises Aden and pushes him into the cavernous pit of cow excrement. In the final moments, Cassie spots Aden's lighter in the mud, she strikes it and lets it fall into the methane-filled cavity. The pit and the surrounding methane erupt in a massive explosion, leaving Cassie, Hannah and Amy clinging to each other, as a family."

Cassie is struggling; her relationship with her two daughters, Amy and Hannah  is fractious. She is struggling to run her farm and her financial situation is so bad that she can no longer afford to pay Cooper.

Quick to cover up her secret, Cassie tells Aden that Dean left. Aden asks if he can stay the night and after some convincing from Amy, Cassie reluctantly concedes. The next day Aden persuades Cassie that he can be of use to her on the farm and Cassie allows him to stay on, much to the displeasure of Cassie's 16 year old daughter Hannah who immediately dislikes Aden, sussing out his intentions of getting ""into my mum's knickers"".

The movie version of the story is this: Kambar, the kavichakravarthi whose name in enshrined forever as the author of Ramavatharam, the Tamil version of Ramayana, is a poet in Kulothunga’s court in Urayur. Despite his erudite scholarship, deep learning of Sanskrit and Tamil and extraordinary poetic skills, Kamban remains a humble, unassuming, deeply pious man, and a loyal subject of the King. All this earns Kamban a special place in the heart of Kulothunga who treats him with utmost deference and affection. Ottakoothar is another great poet in the King’s court, and Kamban’s ascent in the firmament and the King’s unabashed admiration for Kamban’s poetry has Ottakoothar simmering in jealousy. It is in this backdrop that the love story blossoms. Amaravathi, the beautiful princess and Ambikapathy, the handsome and talented son of Kambar, fall in love. Ambikapathy is a bold, assertive and supremely self-confident youth, who even at that age, exhibits poetic skills equal to that of his illustrious father. Ottakoothar is doubly dismayed when he hears of this affair, for he had planned to bring about the marriage of Amaravathi with his stooge, Prince Kulasekharan of Vengi. With a brilliant, cunning mind at work, Ottakoothar sets about poisoning the King’s mind against Ambikapathi and contrives to bring about various situations wherein Ambikapathi might fall to disgrace. Luck seems to be on Ambikapathi’s side as he comes unscathed through these traps. However, when Kamban discovers his son’s love for the princess and realizes the gruesome retribution that would undoubtedly follow, he pleads with Ambikapathi to give up his love. Meanwhile, Ottakoothar gets possession of a verse that Ambikapathi had penned as an ode to Amaravathi’s beauty and loses no time to showing the parchment to the King. The King is shaken by this clinching evidence of the love affair, and is determined to put it to an end. However, wishing to avoid any unwanted publicity and not willing to take any drastic measures, at the suggestion of Kamban, the King orders Ambikapathi to go to the distant Pushpaga Theevu, apparently to propagate the greatness of Tamil. A storm leads to the ship in which Ambikapathy is traveling being wrecked; and hanging on to a log, Ambikapathi is washed ashore in Shenbaga Theevu. Coming to know of the developments in Uraiyur, Ambikapathy hastens in disguise thereto. With the help of Kannamma, the daughter of Pugazhendhi Pulavar, he succeeds in meeting Amaravathi, and they plan to flee to Shenbaga Theevu that night. But their plans go awry and both are caught trying to leave the palace. The King sentences Ambikapathy to death. But Amaravathi intervenes, claiming equal responsibility for whatever may have been the crime that Ambikapathi is said to have committed. In the ensuing argument, the King condemns Ambikapathi as sham poet who could write only verses that cater to man’s baser instincts. Ambikapathy is outraged at this slur on his poetic capabilities. The upshot is that if Ambikapathi could sing 100 devotional songs in succession, the King promises him Amaravathi’s hand in marriage. If he failed in this challenge, he would be executed forthwith. Amaravathi visits Ambikapathi in prison that night and urges caution. Ambikapathi laughs away her fears, assuring her that he is wholly confident of his own capabilities. A relieved Amaravathi says that she would be counting the songs, and would appear before him at the end of the ordeal. The court assembles next day at the vasantha madapam, and in the august presence of the King, ministers and scholars, Ambikapathy commences his soiree with a short invocation to Saraswathi, the Goddess of learning. Amaravathi mistakenly counts this as one of the hundred songs, and so at the end of the 99th song, she appears happily in front of Ambikapathi to signal his victory. Overjoyed at sighting his beloved, and thinking that he has completed the hundred songs, Ambikapathy bursts into a verse in praise of Amaravathi’s appearance. Rising with grim satisfaction, Ottakoothar points out that only 99 devotional songs had been sung, and hence Ambikapathy has lost the challenge. Kamban’s anguish-filled plea for clemency falls on deaf ears, as the King orders the death sentence to be carried out. Ambikapathi is put to death, and the grief-stricken Amaravathi too falls dead… their souls unite in heaven.

With the help of Kannamma, the daughter of Pugazhendhi Pulavar, he succeeds in meeting Amaravathi, and they plan to flee to Shenbaga Theevu that night. But their plans go awry and both are caught trying to leave the palace. The King sentences Ambikapathy to death. But Amaravathi intervenes, claiming equal responsibility for whatever may have been the crime that Ambikapathi is said to have committed. In the ensuing argument, the King condemns Ambikapathi as sham poet who could write only verses that cater to man’s baser instincts. Ambikapathy is outraged at this slur on his poetic capabilities. The upshot is that if Ambikapathi could sing 100 devotional songs in succession, the King promises him Amaravathi’s hand in marriage. If he failed in this challenge, he would be executed forthwith. Amaravathi visits Ambikapathi in prison that night and urges caution. Ambikapathi laughs away her fears, assuring her that he is wholly confident of his own capabilities. A relieved Amaravathi says that she would be counting the songs, and would appear before him at the end of the ordeal. The court assembles next day at the vasantha madapam, and in the august presence of the King, ministers and scholars, Ambikapathy commences his soiree with a short invocation to Saraswathi, the Goddess of learning. Amaravathi mistakenly counts this as one of the hundred songs, and so at the end of the 99th song, she appears happily in front of Ambikapathi to signal his victory. Overjoyed at sighting his beloved, and thinking that he has completed the hundred songs, Ambikapathy bursts into a verse in praise of Amaravathi’s appearance. Rising with grim satisfaction, Ottakoothar points out that only 99 devotional songs had been sung, and hence Ambikapathy has lost the challenge. Kamban’s anguish-filled plea for clemency falls on deaf ears, as the King orders the death sentence to be carried out. Ambikapathi is put to death, and the grief-stricken Amaravathi too falls dead… their souls unite in heaven.

Meanwhile, Lucky has been drafted. His lawyer, Ernest Higgins , tries to get him off by giving the orphaned Lucky a ""mother"" in alcoholic panhandler Annie , but the draft board is unconvinced, and he ends up in the army. To avoid work, Lucky lounges in the canteen, where he meets Jill Evans . He gets found out and is thrown in the stockade, but escapes. To get out of camp, he steals the car and papers of an army engineer. To his puzzlement, two thugs catch up to him on the road and try to rough him up. They leave when Jill drives up. Lucky takes Jill along with him against her will, and they become acquainted. She threatens to throw out Lucky's papers if he does not let her go. Since they are not his, he is unconcerned when she dumps them by the roadside. When Lucky sneaks back into the city, he finds Slip occupying his office. Slip tells him about some foreigners who are paying him plenty of money to sabotage the American war effort. He even takes credit  for the burning of the SS Normandie, even though he had nothing to do with it. It turns that the two goons Lucky encountered were after papers dealing with secret new tank armor. The trio head back to look for the papers. When Lucky finds them, Slip pulls a gun on him. Fortunately, Lucky is able to knock Slip out; Jill persuades him not to kill the helpless Slip. Still, for $50,000, Lucky is willing to pass along the papers. He phones Slip to arrange an exchange. Annie warns him that Slip has set up a trap, and offers to hide him at her place. Lucky is willing to try selling out his country again, but he is spotted by Slip's men. They follow him back to his hideout. While he is out, they beat Annie up, but she tells them nothing. When Lucky gets back, he checks out where he hid the papers; the thugs  knock him out and take them. From a slim clue, Lucky tracks the spy ring to Kilpatrick Gardens on Long Island. He sneaks around and finds Slip and Kilpatrick  with the papers. He manages to grab them and race away. All the exits are locked and watched, but when a man who had been taking a public tour of the place demands from a guard the return of an umbrella he left behind, Lucky hides the papers and an explanatory note inside the rolled up umbrella. Jill, having spotted Lucky, trails him to the gardens, and asks a guard for the use of the telephone to notify the authorities. Instead, he puts her through to Kilpatrick, who masquerades as an FBI agent. Totally deceived, she helps capture Lucky. Herr Kesselman , the leader of the spies, is disappointed when Lucky, under the mere threat of torture, quickly discloses where he supposedly hid the papers; Kesselman had thought that there were many similarities between Nazis and American gangsters. After most of the spies head off to search, Lucky manages to wrestle away the lone guard's gun. He tells Kesselman he is going to turn over the papers to the government out of new-found patriotism when real FBI agents arrive.

At night he dons the costume of a superhero and fights criminals. At times his brother Tim, visits him. One day Tim tells Griff about his girlfriend 'Melody' and brings her with him the next time he visits. Melody is shown to be a girl who lives in a world of absurd thoughts, who also isn't comfortable with other people. One day Griff gets an idea about becoming invisible and after some research, finds himself doing experiments by purchasing things from Melody's father's store. He makes himself a suit and wearing it, goes to his office but is caught on camera, not yet revealing his face. Griff again makes an invisibility cloak but this time his boss sees his face on camera he gets fired from his job. That night, Tony calls a local goon and beats Griff in an alley. He returns home to retrieve his suit and police catch a bloodied Griff and later release him with a warning. Slowly Griff and Melody fall in love, and Melody tries to encourage Griff in his works by presenting him with a 'Universal SUIT' sent anonymously. It becomes apparent that the superhero, the goons he beats and his invisibility are just his imagination. Tim gets hold of this and asks Melody why she is encouraging him, to which Melody replies Griff is a freak like her and they love living like that. Griff hears this and realizes the fact that everything is his imagination. He destroys the costume and all computers he was using in his imaginary world. He goes to Melody's house for dinner where she realizes Griff no more believes in his imaginary world. Soon afterwards she comes to Griff's home and tells him he was the only one who went into her world and that was the reason she loved him, but now, he also is behaving like normal people, so she can't love him anymore. With saying that, she leaves his house and cries leaning on his door. Suddenly, she falls through the door  and lands in Griff's room. Griff takes her into his arms and she utters, ""You can believe it."" They share a passionate kiss. Soon after, a package falls through the mail slot of Griff's door with Melody's name written on it. Tim is then shown walking away with his new girlfriend. Griff runs into his room to put on his invisible suit, and Melody opens the box. Inside is a note from Tim that says, ""Use these to be the only one who can see Griff when he's invisible. So he doesn't have to wear the hat."" The device resembles a View-Master stereoscopic toy. Griff enters unseen into the room, and when Melody holds up the device to her eyes, she can see him standing there again. They smile at each other as the film ends."

This made Tomura very angry, and he returned to his home without saying anything. In his house, a flashback ensues, showing Tomura's daughter being knocked down by a car in front of his patisserie. He blames himself for the accident because he was supposed to pick his daughter up from her nursery that day, but he forgot because he was busy preparing pastries for a feast. He stopped making pastries because he did not want to be reminded of the accident again. Suddenly, just as ""Patisserie Coin de Rue"" received a huge order to supply patisseries for a party at a French family's party, Yuriko fell down the stairs and broke her arm. As she could not make pastries for three months, she decided to close down the Patisserie Coin de Rue and have to pay a penalty for not honouring her contract. However, Natsume lobbied hard to let her have a chance. She also went to persuade Tomura to take over Yuriko's place, and also convince Mariko to come back to the shop. Together, they managed to produced pastries in time for the party, and their pastries were praised by the people at the party. Later, Natsume received a scholarship to study patisserie-making at a prestigious American university, the place where Yuriko and Tomura studied. Tomura was also reunited with his wife, whom he was separated from after his daughter's accident."

Liu Jinxi  and his wife Yu  are an ordinary couple with two sons, Fangzheng  and Xiaotian  , living together in Liu Village. One day two bandits enter the village and attempt to rob the general store. Liu Jinxi happens to be in the shop and he fights with the robbers when they turn violent towards the shopkeeper and his family. He kills them during the fight. During an autopsy, detective Xu Baijiu  , who is sent to investigate the case, discovers that one of the dead bandits was Yan Dongsheng  , who is among the government's ten most wanted fugitives. The local magistrate is pleased, and Liu Jinxi is regarded as a hero by his fellow villagers. However Xu becomes suspicious because he does not believe that Yan Dongsheng, a fighter, could be easily killed by Liu, who appears to be a mere paper worker. Based on traces of evidence in the shop and Liu and other witnesses' recollections of the fight, in addition to his extensive knowledge on physiology, Xu is able to deduce that Liu is in fact a highly skilled martial artist, as well as the actual events during the fight after noting signs of brain hemorrhaging due to an injury on Yan Dongsheng's Vagus nerve. From subsequent observation, investigation and tests, and information gathered by his partner, Xu learns of Liu's true identity - Tang Long, the second-in-command of the 72 Demons, a group of vicious and bloodthirsty warriors of Tangut descent, who brutally murdered a butcher's family in Jingzhou ten years ago. Xu immediately returns to the county office to obtain an arrest warrant for Tang Long. The magistrate delays issuing the warrant, citing lack of evidence while actually soliciting for a bribe from Xu. Xu eventually obtains the bribe money from his estranged wife, who blames him for causing her father's suicide. After issuing the warrant, the magistrate informs the Master  of the 72 Demons on Tang Long's whereabouts, hoping to receive a reward. The Master is offended and reveals that Tang is actually his son, and he kills the magistrate by severing his Vagus nerve. The Master sends his henchmen to Liu Village to capture Tang and burn down the place. While Xu and the constables are on their way there, two henchmen reach the village and kill a villager to force Tang to acknowledge his identity. Tang can no longer control himself and he fights and kills one of the two assailants and runs away, the other assailant who is the Master's wife  chases Tang and fights with him in the buffalo shed and she gets crushed by the buffaloes in the stampede and falls down in the river. Tangs tries to save her by holding her hand but she falls down to her death. The remaining villagers retreat to a fortress to hide from the 72 Demons while Tang and Xu stay behind. In the meantime Xu devises a plan, utilising his knowledge of physiology, for Tang to fake his death so the 72 Demons will no longer harass him. When the Demons arrive they lament over Tang's death but Xu knows that Tang cannot remain in his ""death"" state for too long so when time is up he revives Tang. Tang severs his left arm in front of the Demons, announcing that he has formally broken ties with them, but they also tell him that the Master is waiting for him at his house. When Tang reaches home he sees that the Master has taken his family hostage. After a tense encounter, the Master declares that he will let Tang go but he must take Xiaotian's blood as a trade. Tang is enraged and he attacks the Master with a broadsword but to no avail, since the Master uses qigong to protect himself from the blade. Xu infiltrates the house through a hatch and he weakens the Master's defense during the fight by piercing his heel with an acupuncture needle from underneath the floor.

He is picked up by his father, Martin, who works in various different countries for the government. In the evening, phone calls put Will in a bad mood and he decides to go fishing the next day. Will is still preoccupied with the phone calls, resulting in an accident which causes his brother's girlfriend to be hit on the side of the head by the sail. Will decides to swim into town to fetch medicine. When he swims back, the boat is gone, and he finds it abandoned. He runs to a local police station where the officer in charge finds out his name and makes a phone call, before asking Will to take him to the boat. They are met there by Zahir, who knows where Will's family is and invites him to show him the way, but Will decides to escape in the police car but doesn't get far. He crashes into a tree and is almost killed until Martin shows up and escapes with him. He reveals he is a CIA agent and that the people who have taken their family are after a briefcase he took. He calls his partner who agrees to meet him in Madrid. They go to the meeting and Will stays in the car while Martin talks to his partner, Jean, who says that she doesn't have the briefcase anymore. He doesn't believe her and thinks something isn't right. As he returns to the car, a sniper murders Martin, and Will is attacked by a man. Will barely escapes but the man follows him through the streets of Madrid. After escaping, he has no money and decides to hide his dad's gun in the trash. Going to the U.S Embassy, Will discovers that he is wanted for killing a police officer which he denies, but they are not interested in finding his family. The Embassy then tells him someone wants to meet him. Jean and Diego wait for him, and Jean says she wants to help. He doesn't trust her and fakes illness to escape. Looking through his father's phone, he sees that Diego's name comes up several times and calls it. He also gets a call from the kidnappers who want to speak to ""Tom"" and say they want the briefcase in exchange for his family. The kidnappers give Will a deadline and meeting point. During this call Will speaks to his mother and tells her Martin was killed. He arrives at Diego's office and speaks to Lucia, the girl who he spoke to on the phone. Suddenly, Diego appears and fights with Will, who kills him. Lucia and Will go to her uncle's apartment but find out that Jean and her hitman Gorman have killed her uncle. Will finds and confronts Jean and Gorman in the kitchen. She wants him to follow her but is interrupted by Lucia coming in. They escape through the rooftops and Will is shot. Instead of a hospital, she takes Will to a nightclub where her friend has medical experience. Will also finds out that Tom is Martin's alias in Spain, and that Lucia is his half sister. Will recovers and goes to a meeting with the kidnapper on the phone. The man on the phone is Zahir who initially beats up Will for information. Once he realizes Will really is ignorant of what is happening, Zahir tells him the truth. The briefcase was stolen from a Mossad agent by Martin. Zahir is an Israeli agent determined to recover the case. He realises that Jean is the corrupt agent, not Martin and she wants to sell the contents of the case. He decides to use Will to lure out Jean and the buyers of the briefcase. Zahir shows Will's family saying he must do as he says, and this must succeed or the family will be released and Jean will kill them. Will has a plan to lure out Jean by using Lucia's credit card at the club. This lures out Gorman who is subdued by the bouncers at the club and tortured for information. Gorman gives nothing away and Will's next plan is to make him think he has escaped so they can follow him. This works and they follow him to Jean, who then lead them to an underground car park. The Israeli agents follow but a noise spooks Jean who kills the buyers and tries to escape. Gorman is killed trying to escape in his car, and Will and Lucia then pursue Jean. After a pursuit through Madrid, the roles are reversed and Jean chases them due to her frustration with their interference. The cars then collide, and Will's car is worse off. Just as Jean is about to deliver the final blow, she is taken out by Zahir, who retrieves the briefcase. As Lucia recovers in hospital, she also meets her new half family, and Will is offered a job in the CIA."

She starts spreading false rumours about Rajat and her having an affair. Mukta is disturbed by the rumours. Rajat tries to assuage her and assures that there is no such thing going on. However, with each day, Mukta's suspicion and bitterness towards Rajat grow stronger. Finally, Rajat too is unable to take this and calls it quits. The duo go through a divorce and get separated. After that Rajat goes downhill. He starts drinking excessively and causes headlines for all the wrong reasons. Rajat terminates Sheetal's contract with his firm. This causes huge financial losses to Rajat's firm, as Sheetal has become famous and almost no model is ready to step into her shoes. Meanwhile, Mukta discovers that she is pregnant with Rajat's child and starts to repent of what she did. She tries to reconcile, but Sheetal coldly informs her that she has lost Rajat to Sheetal for good, no matter what the case appears to be.

Will Mukta ever come to know that Rajat was innocent? Will Sheetal play spoilsport to Mukta's life even more? Will Mukta and Rajat ever be able to reconcile? What landed all of them in court?

30723003	/m/0gfdgyn	The Confession			26	{}	{}	"{""/m/02hmvc"": ""Short Film""}"	Sam, an eight-year-old attending a Catholic school, and his trouble making friend Jacob prepare for their first confession. Their class is given a list of sins that children can confess. These include “bullying” and “swearing” among others. Sam pores over the list but is unable to come up with a sin he has done. Sam asks Jacob what he will confess. Jacob states that he would mention not listening to his mom and locking his sister in the closet. Sam feels like he will not be a true Catholic if he cannot be absolved, so he turns to Jacob to suggest a sin Sam could commit and then confess to. Jacob and Sam decide to steal Farmer Collins’ Scarecrow and leave in middle of the road for him to find while he is driving his tractor to town, committing the sin of “stealing.” The plan backfires when Famer Collins pulls off the main road before he sees the stolen scarecrow. At the moment the tractor pulls off the road, another car speeds down the twisted and deserted street and, believing the scarecrow to be a dead body, swerves to avoid it and crashes into a tree. Sam walks up to the car and sees a woman and a little girl alive, but severely dazed and bleeding from the head. The car bursts into flames. Sam and Jacob flee the scene with the scarecrow. As they are running through the woods they hear the car explode. Sam and Jacob push the scarecrow off a cliff by the tree they play by every day. Jacob makes Sam swear never to tell anyone because “it was an accident.” Sam is full of guilt. That night he dreams the dead woman, the farmer and his father all know. He is haunted by what he has done. In school the next day Sam runs out of his class into the bathroom, unable to deal with what he has done. Jacob runs after him and tells him that no one knows that he has to keep it together. Jacob tells Sam to meet him at the tree where they hid the scarecrow after dinner. During dinner that night Sam’s father mentions that Collins’ scarecrow was missing, leading guilt striven Sam to believe that his father knows what he has done. After dinner he meets Jacob by the tree. Sam wants to tell someone what has happened. Jacob states that if he does Jacob will deny everything because it was Sam’s fault. The two boys start pushing each other, while Sam yells over and over again “it’s not my fault, it’s not my fault.” During the fight Sam accidentally pushes Jacob into the same cliff they dumped the scarecrow the day before. Jacob dies instantly. The next day Sam goes to church early in the morning in his robes to have his first confession. While the Priest states that confession does start until later, Sam insists that he confess his sins now. The Priest, seeing that something is clearly troubling Sam, agrees. Sam states “Bless me father for I have sinned, this is my first confession.” The Priest gently asks Sam to name his sins. With tears streaming down his face Sam, unable to say all he has done, confesses not listening to his mum and locking his sister in the closet, the same sins his now deceased friend Jacob was going to confess. The Priest declares Sam’s sins to be absolved. The scene changes to the empty cross in the field and then fades to black.

Cal  is an 18-year-old closeted gay gang member who has nothing in his life except drugs, sex, random acts of violence and a secret that he keeps hidden from his mates. An online hookup for sex with a stranger, Scott , ends in him assaulting and abandoning Scott out in the countryside. This temporarily satisfies but fails to dampen his unspoken desires for his best mate, Jonno . Nessa , their twisted, foul-mouthed and controlling, de facto gang leader who harbours much hatred towards everyone for losing a child at the age of 14, suspects that there is something going on between them but she can't put her finger on it. Jonno, putty in Nessa's hands, can't express his own deep rooted and unrequited attachment to Cal. Manipulating situations that bring her closer to having her suspicions confirmed, Nessa sets out about dividing loyalties and encouraging conflict. For no good reason an innocent student, Olivier , falls victim to one of her plans and is mugged on her orders by the gang. Cal steps in to restrain them and creates a distraction allowing Olivier to run free. Ignoring Nessa's screams of contempt, he chases after him and offers him a lift by way of an apology. Fearing that the fall-out from Nessa for his actions will be harsh, Cal persuades Olivier to help him out. Seizing the moral high ground and sensing that there was something more to Cal's Good Samaritan act, Olivier allows Cal to stay with him for a few days. Acting on his own attraction to Cal, Olivier seduces him and in doing so, exposes Cal to new emotions and a tenderness that he has never experienced before. Soon, the boys are overtaken by the embrace of the first flush of love. Cal and Olivier's relationship progress, but Olivier is warned by Scott, who happens to be one of his professors, to be wary of Cal. Scott gives Olivier his phone number and tells Olivier to contact him if he is ever in need of help. Nessa can't contain her rage for Cal's disloyalty to the gang and sets about hunting him down, intent on destroying him once and for all. With her gang in tow and Jonno tightly wound up, she kidnaps Olivier, taunting Cal with video messages via her mobile phone, to come and save his boyfriend. Arriving at the abandoned factory where they are all waiting for him, Cal squares up to Nessa and tells her that she needs to let Olivier go. He also says that he is equally hurt by the child she lost, as he was the father. Meanwhile, Jonno and the other gang members begin to destroy Cal's car before they turn toward him. As the showdown unfolds, Nessa loses all control of events and Jonno explodes in act of sexual aggression by raping Cal and leaving everyone traumatised. Shocked by what she has witnessed, Nessa realises she will now never be able to break the bond between Cal and Olivier while she and the other gang members flee. Olivier then contacts Scott for help and he rescues them and tends to Cal's wounds. As the film ends Cal sends Scott a video of the man being beat up in the opening scenes of the movie, with the message ""Sorry"". That man turns out to be Scott's husband  who is still in a coma at the hospital.

30741010	/m/0gd3mmg	Amanda Knox: Murder on Trial in Italy	2011-02-21			{}	"{""/m/09c7w0"": ""United States of America""}"	"{""/m/0lsxr"": ""Crime Fiction"", ""/m/07s9rl0"": ""Drama""}"	"{{Plot}} The film depicts events that occurred after Knox moved to Perugia, Italy, in September 2007, as a foreign exchange student attending language classes at the University for Foreigners. Knox shares an upstairs flat in a cottage with Kercher, a British student, and two Italian women, Filomena and Laura. In October, Knox meets Raffaele Sollecito, an Italian student of computer engineering, at a classical music concert, and she begins to stay at his house each night. On November 1, Kercher dies in her bedroom from stab wounds. Searching for evidence in the days following the murder, police question both Knox and Sollecito about recent events. Knox admits that she and Sollecito had ""smoked weed"" on the night of November&nbsp;1, and states that they had gone to his house, watched a film on his computer, and gone to bed. Meanwhile, the chief prosecutor of Perugia, Giuliano Mignini, discusses the case with the coroner and forensic investigators from Rome. The coroner makes mention of multiple bruises on Kercher's body, stating that she had probably fought back in the struggle, and the prosecutor inquires whether more than one person could have been involved in the fatal attack. In an interrogation at the police station, an officer informs Sollecito about telephone records indicating that he has called the emergency number after, and not before, the Polizia Postale had arrived at the cottage. A policeman warns Sollecito that his rich, influential family will not be able to protect him. Sollecito asserts that Knox had told him to make certain claims, that she had not really been with him at the time of the murder, and that he had not ""thought about the contradictions"" in his alibi. Police subsequently approach Knox, who has been performing cartwheels while waiting alone in the hall, and ask her to explain a text message that has been found on her cell phone. The officers claim that Knox had left the message for her employer, pub owner Patrick Lumumba, on the night of the murder to tell him she would meet him later. Knox replies that, in English, the words amounted more to ""I'll see you around"" than ""meet me later"". Surrounding her, the police order Knox to tell them about meeting Lumumba that night, or suffer the consequences. Several hours later, Knox states that she had met Lumumba in a local square, that they had gone to the cottage with Kercher, and that Lumumba had entered Kercher's room before her death. Knox, Sollecito and Lumumba are arrested. Under police interrogation, his face swollen with bruises, Lumumba insists that he hardly knew Kercher and that he has never visited the cottage. Some days later, he is released when a university professor reveals that he had been with him at the pub Le Chic, and could not have been at the cottage at the time of the murder. The parents of Knox travel to Italy to help their daughter, and hire lawyers for her defense in court. The forensics team finds a bloody fingerprint in the murder room that does not match the prints of either Knox or Sollecito. The resulting manhunt leads to the arrest of Rudy Guede, originally from the Côte d'Ivoire, whom Knox and Kercher had met weeks earlier when he was playing the guitar in the downstairs flat at the cottage with the Italian men who lived there. Guede later goes to trial and is found guilty of murder and sexual assault. Knox and Sollecito are indicted in the same court judgment. Knox and Sollecito are tried jointly in 2009 on the charges of murder, sexual assault, staging a crime scene, and transporting a lethal knife. Luminol tests in the cottage hallway revealed small footprints, which were too small for the men to have made, but approximated the size of Knox's feet. DNA experts testify that Knox's blood was found on a bathroom tap, mixed with Kercher's. In Sollecito's apartment, police found a large kitchen knife, with Knox's DNA on the handle and four cells of Kercher's on the blade. A defense expert testifies that 10 cells would be required for the purpose of evidence, since four DNA cells indicated ""contamination"" rather than evidence that the knife had been used as a murder weapon. The prosecution insists that Knox had argued with Kercher and stabbed her, as presented in an hypothetical flashback set in Kercher's room. The chief forensics investigator testifies that Sollecito's DNA was found on a metal clasp severed from the back strap of Kercher's bra . Sollecito's attorney asks when the bra clasp was discovered. The investigator replies that it was photographed on the first day after the murder, but only collected 47 days later, during which time it had been moved from its original position and passed between the various members of the forensics team. Although the attorney claims that this small amount of DNA is possibly the result of contamination, the investigator replies that, with the exception of the clasp, only a cigarette butt in the kitchen held Sollecito's DNA, stating, ""DNA does not fly around"". Eventually, in December 2009, the jury delivers a verdict of guilty: Knox is sentenced to 26 years in prison, Sollecito to 25 years. Knox's father reassures his daughter that he and her mother will appeal the verdict in a new trial. The film closes with a caption stating that the parents of the real-life Knox have both been charged with criminal slander for claiming that police had abused their daughter, and that they face three years' imprisonment if found guilty. Note: The film is now shown with an amendment noting the subsequent acquittal of Knox and Sollecito on appeal."

Attla, known as ""the Huslia Hustler,"" took his nickname from one of his mentors, Jimmy Huntington, who first began winning races during Attla's childhood. In recent generations, this nickname has become associated with Attla far more than with Huntington. Attla was a leading star of the 1960s and 1970s in the sport of sprint dog sled racing. He won the Fur Rendezvous World Championship race, held in Anchorage, Alaska, 10 times between 1958 and 1982. He also won 8 championships in the Open North American Championship race, held in Fairbanks, Alaska. In addition, despite his mushing experience being geared more towards sprint than distance racing, Attla competed in the inaugural Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race in 1973, placing fifth. In a 2011 interview, Attla spoke of the popularity of the Iditarod, and how sprint racing ""is now a second-class sport"" as a result. The general theme of the story centered around Attla's rivalry with the other leading sprint competitors of the day, fellow Alaska Native Gareth Wright (the brother of political gadfly [[Don Wright  and Massachusetts musher Roland ""Doc"" Lombard, the preparations for an upcoming big race, and his first major race victory. Most of the movie was set and filmed in Fairbanks. A number of local actors, including local Alaska Natives, University of Alaska Fairbanks professor Lee Salisbury, and KFAR disc jockey/newscaster Bill Walley, appear in minor roles."

He is scathing of her claims in the newspaper that she is tired of publicity and of men pursuing her, believing it to be an attempt to get more attention. He predicts that if she were really left alone she would throw herself at the first man that she met. After being challenged by a man at his club, Datchett decides to invite her to stay at his house aiming to stage a ""scientific experiment"" and prove his theory right. In real life Marly is genuinely weary of her publicity agent|publicity-seeking agent and is besieged by autograph hunters and journalists. When she receives Datchett's invitation to stay at his house she accepts in the hope of some solitude. After travelling down to his country house with her maid Clair, she is greeted by the butler Jameson and Lord Datchett, now pretending to be Henry Dodds, the estate manager. The other staff have all been roped in to help maintain the deception. Datchett tries to discover more about Marly, but she is at first unforthcoming. Slowly they begin to bond, after they go out riding together and when they are locked in a cellar for several hours and get drunk on brandy. Clair meanwhile flirts with both Jameson and Patrick, the Irish gardener provoking them into jealousy and rivalry. When the Reverend Meadows turns up at the house with a Christening party for whom Datchett has agreed to be a Godfather, Marly discovers who Datchett really is in spite of his efforts to deceive her.

While asleep he travels into his past where his dreams of old come back to him mixed with the young boy's world of fantasy and music. The old man has to find the memories most important to him. On September 7, the director of Imaginaerum, Stobe Harju, gave a word on the film, revealing more about the story. ""Imaginaerum tells the story of an elderly composer, Tom, who suffers from severe dementia. As he has had the disease for years and has regressed into childhood, he remembers practically nothing from his adult life. His music, friends, all his past including the memory of his daughter are a blur in his fragile mind. All he has left is the imagination of a ten-year-old boy. As he drifts away into coma, it seems impossible to get back what he has lost. Tom travels through his imaginary world seeking answers and finding memories, while his daughter, Gem, tries to recover the bond she had once shared with her father in the real world. As they have become more and more distant from each other over the years, and as there's even greater obstacles separating them now — Tom's coma and his imminent death — Gem's project feels doomed to failure. However, through Tom's darkest secrets, Gem discovers the path she must follow in order to find her father again.""Nightwish official website - Imaginarium"

The only dwelling on the island, Fairweather Cottage, is seasonally operated by the owner Doug from the mainland and only reachable by ferry. After previously suffering a miscarriage, Kate's relationship with Martin has become tense, and in an effort to rekindle their marriage they decide on a return visit to the island. A few nights into their stay, the generator in the cottage explodes, injuring Martin's arm and leaving them without electricity. They use the CB radio, their only source of communication to the mainland, to call Doug who agrees to ferry out to help them. Kate spends the next day waiting at the jetty for Doug to arrive, but to no avail. Later a mysterious man in green combat fatigues washes up on the island, bloodied and half-conscious. When he comes round, he identifies himself as a soldier, Private Jack Coleman . He tells Martin and Kate that there has been an outbreak of an airborne disease, Argromoto Flu, codenamed R1N16, which started in South America and has spread over the entire world in the timespan of a few weeks. The virus is incurable and highly contagious, attacking the respiratory system and causing the victims to choke on blood with a 100% fatality rate. Jack says that the military has lost control, and is now advising civilians to seal themselves up in their homes and not allow anybody access. With only static now coming from the CB radio, Martin decides to play it safe and help Jack, who aggressively takes command, board up the door and the windows. Over the next few days, Jack becomes increasingly strange and erratic, and his intimidating behaviour begins to disturb the couple even further. They even suspect that the virus may not be real and Jack may be insane. When Kate asks him if he is married, he tells her his wife died of R1N16 and he becomes aggressive and threatening. Martin and Kate decide to leave the cottage and take their chances outside, but Jack refuses to let them, forcing them into the bedroom at gunpoint and locking them in. Martin sneaks outside through a skylight, finding the bodies of Doug and his wife at the pier, killed by gunshot wounds. Using Doug's hunting shotgun, Martin returns to the cottage and gets the upper hand on Jack. However, just as Kate begins to tie Jack's hands behind his back, Martin suddenly begins coughing up blood; it appears the Argromoto Flu is very real and he is infected. Kate is forced to shoot her husband dead with the shotgun, to spare him a slow and agonising death. Jack reveals to Kate that he was experimented upon at a secure military compound, from where he was released without realizing he was a carrier of R1N16. Jack infected his wife, killing her, and he fled to Blackholme Island to quarantine himself. Jack reveals the CB radio worked all along, and he just changed the settings so Kate and Martin would not be able to reach anyone. Jack fixes the CB radio and the military broadcast on it claims the soldiers have a vaccine to the virus. He tells her that the military are lying, there is no vaccine, and that the military will not allow them to leave the island alive. Kate does not believe him, and angered by the possibility that Martin could have been saved she shoots Jack dead. As she attempts to leave the island in the boat with Martin's body, a military helicopter flies over and she is killed by a sniper who shoots her in the head.

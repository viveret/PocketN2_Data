An unseen figure saws a tree limb acting as a counterweight with a pole saw, and cuts it off, sending the family up, strangling them. Months later, true-crime novelist Ellison Oswalt  moves into the same house as the murdered family with his wife, Tracy , and their two children Ashley  and Trevor . Ellison uses the murders as the basis for his new book. Supposedly, there were five members in the family, and one of the children went missing after the murders. Ellison finds a box in the attic, which contains a projector and several reels of Super 8 footage that are each labeled as if innocent home movies. He watches the films, all depicting families murdered in various ways, including having their throats slit in bed , an arson , being drowned in their pool , being run over by a lawn mower  and the hanging that opened the movie . The drowning one proves especially disturbing for him, as he sees a dark figure with a demonic face in the pool. Upon seeing figure, strange things begin happening around the house. Ellison continues to observe the films, and discovers strange things in them, such as symbols painted near the murder scenes, and the demonic figure, which he eventually notices in every film. He calls a deputy  to help him find the location of these murders. After going through the images, the deputy refers him to a local professor, Jonas , whose expertise lies within the occult and demonic phenomena, to decipher the symbol in the films. Jonas tells Ellison that the symbols are that of a Pagan deity named Bughuul, who was known as an eater of children's souls, killing the families of the child and then taking the child to his own netherworld. One night, Ellison hears the film projector running and goes up to the attic. He finds five children  watching one of the films. Bughuul suddenly appears on camera, up-close, unlike in any of the other films. When Bughuul suddenly appears in front of him, Ellison falls from the attic. Having had enough, he burns the projector and the film and moves out with his family. Upon returning to their old house, he goes into the attic and finds the box containing the projector and film, completely unharmed. However, there is a new item inside: an envelope with ""extended endings."" Within that, Ellison finds that after each murder took place, the missing child would come onscreen, revealing them to be the murderers, and then disappear. Ellison again chats with Professor Jonas, who sends him scans of rare historical drawings of the mysterious symbol and explains that Bughuul supposedly lived in the images, which acted as portals between his realm and the mortal realm. Shortly after, the deputy, whose repeated calls Ellison had been ignoring all day, calls again and this time Ellison picks up. The deputy informs him that he has discovered the link between the murders: each family had last lived in the house where the previous murder had taken place. By moving out of the house, the deputy continues, Ellison has put himself and his family in place to continue the pattern. Ellison begins feeling light-headed. He looks in his empty coffee cup and finds a mysterious liquid left behind, then notices the note that was under his cup from his daughter reading ""Good Night Daddy"", and loses consciousness. Upon waking, he finds himself, his wife and son bound and gagged in the same manner as the families in the Super 8 films. Ashley walks in, carrying an axe and a Super 8 camera. She then, using the axe, murders her family, and paints the walls in their blood, with several childish images such as unicorns, cats and dogs . She then goes to the projector and plays the film she just took, revealing the children in the hallway. Upon Bughuul's appearance, the children run away. Bughuul's hands are covered in the mysterious green liquid from Ellison's coffee cup, implying it was his blood. Bughuul picks up Ashley and walks into the film with her. The final shot shows the box of film in the attic of the Oswalt house, this time with a new canister that reads ""House Painting '12"". Suddenly, Bughuul appears , implying that the viewers are his next victims."

Excusing himself, Top Cat quickly runs after the female cat, interrupted by Griswald, but soon gets him out of the way and meets up with the female cat, who introduces herself as Trixie. While she finds him amusing, an alley cat isn't her type. At the alley, Top Cat catches news of the Maharaja of Pikachu, known for his generosity and his rubies are just what Top Cat needs to impress Trixie. Top Cat and his gang head to the Connity Hall to meet the Maharaja, running into an obnoxious man named Strickland. The gang steal his tickets and get him sent away. While the gang distract Officer Dibble who is the Maharaja's escort, Top Cat makes a bet with the Maharaja and gets out of him a Maharaja Talk 5000 device with many functions, as the Maharaja hasn't any rubies. Next morning Officer Dibble is summoned to the Police station to work for the Chief’s son-in-law Strickland, who is taking over for the retired Chief. Strickland has replaced the staff with robots which he believes are more competent. Top Cat thwarts Strickland's attempt to evict him, preventing Strickland from getting the Mayor's funding for a robot police army. Strickland uses Trixie to keep Top Cat away from the alley while he carries his out his plan. Top Cat returns to the alley getting shunned by his gang, arrested by police and after an unfair trial, convicted to the Dog Jail on charge of stealing money from an orphanage. With the arrest of Top Cat, Strickland is granted the Mayor's funding and establishes a robot police army and a major scale surveillance camera system which restricts privacy for the city. Meanwhile Top Cat tries to keep a low profile in dog jail but later becomes popular having turned the jail into a paradise for the convicts. As for Top Cat's gang they are struggling and begin to express their disbelief in him, which Top Cat notices from the one of the security cameras. Strickland abuses his authority and starts coming up with ridiculous laws to take absurd amounts of money off people, intending to spend it on making himself even more 'handsome'. Tired of Strickland's tyranny, Trixie quits her job and turns to Officer Dibble and shows him evidence that a robot Top Cat sent by Strickland robbed the orphanage proving Top Cat's innocence. Dibble escapes to pass this to Top Cat's gang, but Trixie is captured by the police robots. After Dibble tells the gang what really happened, they all head for Big Gus to help them break Top Cat out of prison, as he owes Top Cat. Big Gus leads them through an underground passage to the dog jail and leaves. The gang apologises for their doubts about Top Cat. With their cover blown by the dogs knowing they've got cats with them, the gang and Dibble escape through a sewer hole arriving at Strickland's HQ. The gang infiltrate the building in robot guises finding Strickland his imprisoned everyone in the city and hoarded the city's cash. While Dibble distracts Strickland, the gang under the guise of robots make their way to Strickland's control centre, but Top Cat's gang are locked in Strickland's vault having tripped a silent alarm, Top Cat remaining outside. When Strickland arrives, he orders Top Cat to be annihilated by the robots. As a single robot enters, Top Cat realises the whole security system was manufactured by the Maharaja of Pikachu. Top Cat takes out the Maharaja Talk 5000 which presumably controls all robots to get Stickland. In panic, Strickland self-destructs the robot army except the single one, revealed to be Fancy Pancy still in his robot guise. Everyone imprisoned and Top Cat's gang is released in the self-destruction process. Strickland is rendered helpless and Dibble arrests him and  sentences him to the Dog Jail. Top Cat and Trixie renew their relationship, Officer Dibble is promoted as the new Chief of Police, the gang enjoy themselves and finally Griswald asks for a place in Top Cat's gang, which Top Cat accepts.

As for Top Cat's gang they are struggling and begin to express their disbelief in him, which Top Cat notices from the one of the security cameras. Strickland abuses his authority and starts coming up with ridiculous laws to take absurd amounts of money off people, intending to spend it on making himself even more 'handsome'. Tired of Strickland's tyranny, Trixie quits her job and turns to Officer Dibble and shows him evidence that a robot Top Cat sent by Strickland robbed the orphanage proving Top Cat's innocence. Dibble escapes to pass this to Top Cat's gang, but Trixie is captured by the police robots. After Dibble tells the gang what really happened, they all head for Big Gus to help them break Top Cat out of prison, as he owes Top Cat. Big Gus leads them through an underground passage to the dog jail and leaves. The gang apologises for their doubts about Top Cat. With their cover blown by the dogs knowing they've got cats with them, the gang and Dibble escape through a sewer hole arriving at Strickland's HQ.

While Dibble distracts Strickland, the gang under the guise of robots make their way to Strickland's control centre, but Top Cat's gang are locked in Strickland's vault having tripped a silent alarm, Top Cat remaining outside. When Strickland arrives, he orders Top Cat to be annihilated by the robots. As a single robot enters, Top Cat realises the whole security system was manufactured by the Maharaja of Pikachu. Top Cat takes out the Maharaja Talk 5000 which presumably controls all robots to get Stickland. In panic, Strickland self-destructs the robot army except the single one, revealed to be Fancy Pancy still in his robot guise. Everyone imprisoned and Top Cat's gang is released in the self-destruction process. Strickland is rendered helpless and Dibble arrests him and  sentences him to the Dog Jail. Top Cat and Trixie renew their relationship, Officer Dibble is promoted as the new Chief of Police, the gang enjoy themselves and finally Griswald asks for a place in Top Cat's gang, which Top Cat accepts.

Barney scares them off, puts on his PJs and throws his boot at a noisy wolf, only to have it thrown back at him. Unbeknownst to him, an echidna had snuck under Barney's covers. He finally goes to bed and runs up a tree when the echidna spikes Barney's bottom. Barney gets back down and sets up bear traps and mouse traps around his camp, only to fall for them himself when a squirrel wakes him up with the radio. Barney falls asleep after hearing a lullaby, but accidentally pumps a lot more air into his sleeping bag, blowing it up. Rain then begins to pour and cause a flood, to which Barney decides to sleep under."

The Stranger  becomes violent towards The Teacher  and chases him away. He then runs towards the camera and grabs it, screaming, 'Forty days!' into it. A young girl watches a news broadcast where a woman  is showing photographs of her missing son, The Teacher. On the beach at dawn, people gather at the water's edge. The Stranger walks into the water and waits there. From the sand dunes The Teacher, dressed in bedraggled clothing, appears and walks the to water. He removes his clothes and walks into the sea towards The Stranger, who pushes him under the water. When The Teacher emerges, he cries and is carried to shore where he is wrapped in a cloth and carried away while the people sing, 'He is come.' Later that day there is a gathering at the beach, where the council await a visit from ICU, a company who has worked closely with the town for years. Entertainers perform for the crowds but are interrupted by The Stranger, who digs a door out of the sand. He stands the door up and from behind it appears a young boy with the likeness of The Teacher. As soon as it begins, the event is over and the celebrations continue until the Company Man  arrives by boat, accompanied by his Security Chief  and full security team. The Company Man begins addressing the people of the town but is interrupted when a woman  strapped with explosives emerges from the crowd. A masked man who has hijacked the tannoy system  threatens to detonate the bomb if the company do not leave the town. Before anything happens, The Teacher appears at the waves and walks to the woman, talking to her. He discovers that her name is Joanna and asks her to tell him her story. He removes the bomb and the two embrace, but before any of the security or police can speak with them, they are gone. The bomber is arrested and taken away. Later that day ICU holds a conference at the town hall to discuss their plans for the town. The Company man speaks to the mayor about why he can't tell the people of the town that they will all be moved on, and that he must lie to them. The Company Man takes to the mic and explains to the people of the town that in addition to the M4 motorway that runs through the town, the company will be adding a new road, entitled the Passover Project. He explains that families who's houses stand in the way will be rehomed. The people of the town start to revolt, until one woman is shot by the Security Chief. The Teacher appears and cradles her. When questioned by the Company Man about what he wants, he replies, 'I came here to listen!' The teacher gathers more followers; a fisherman, Peter , Alfie , a man who is haunted by the ghosts of people who used to live in his street, homeless twins with no name who he calls Legion , his brother whom he doesn't recognise, Kyle  and a musician, Simon . At the shopping centre, his mother finds him, but he doesn't recognise her. Later that night, The Teacher and his friends celebrate at Peter's local club. The Teacher is volunteered to draw the raffle, and his mother approaches him again. She gives him a photograph of him and his daughter, who he doesn't remember. The encounter visibly moves him, and he calls Joanne into a back room. There he asks her to give him up to ICU's security, and she reluctantly agrees. The friends stumble outside drunkenly, and there The Teacher sees visions of three women, his daughter, his wife and his mother-in-law. He then sees a vision of the Security Chief, covered in blood and adorned with antlers. He asks him to tell him his story, but the vision replies, 'I have no story. I am.' The visions disappear and The Teacher notices a roofer at work on a nearby house. The roofer is his father, and for a brief moment, he recognises him. His father explain that he has lost a piece of slate from the roof and asks his son to find it. When he does, it's broken, and his father explains that sometimes you have to sacrifice one piece of slate to realise that the roof needs to be fixed. The Teacher reluctantly agrees and is arrested by a local police office, Sgt. Phillips . He is taken to the back of a flat-bed truck where the Security Chief tells him he knows everything about him, about his failed marriage and how he never gets to see his daughter any more. He accuses The Teacher of leading an uprising against ICU and tells him that the people of the town look to him as their king. At that moment, Peter is being quizzed by a local news team about whether he is affiliated with The Teacher, but he denies ever knowing him. The Teacher reluctantly admits his is the king of the town, knowing that he is the piece of slate that is sacrificed to save the whole roof. The following day The Teacher and the bomber from the beach, Barry Absalum are tried. Barry is set free and The Teacher is found guilty by the Company Man. Peter tries to stop the events happening by declaring that he does know The Teacher, but it is too late. He is dragged into the town centre and is beaten by the security team. They dress him in a nighty and place a crown of barbed wire upon his head to humiliate him. Sgt Phillips and the rest of the local police refuse to participate. The Teacher is bundled into a van and driven to a local stonemasons, where he is handed a cross. He then follows Simon's drum, and a procession of all the people in the town begin to walk. The Teacher collapses and is carried into the town centre, where his mother bathes his wounds and replaces his crown with one of roses. The procession continues until they reach the beach, where a podium built of all of the doors of the people of the town stands. The Teacher is stripped and nailed to the cross and raised above the town. As he hangs, picture of his daughter comes alive in his mind and suddenly he remembers. We cut to The Teacher's video diary of his forty missing days, where he flees to the hills surrounding the town due to pressure in his life. He lives happily in the hills, free from his troubles, remarking about the M4 motorway that scars the town. He states that 'Nobody stops in Port Talbot'. On the fortieth day, when journeying into the town for food, he gets lost and begins to forget who he is. It is at this moment that he stubles down to the beach where he is held under the water by The Stranger. With his memory restored, The Teacher begins to cry out about all of the memories of the town until the skyline is lit with a burst of light and all of the town is brought back to life with old memories. After he dies, his followers wrap him in cloth and lower him gently, where his mother cradles his body and sings to him. Joanne approaches to remove the cloth to show the town their hero one last time, but when she does, his body is gone and in his place are hundreds of flowers. The Stranger appears on the podium, exclaiming, 'It is finished, it has begun!' and pulls back his hood to reveal himself as The Teacher.

The Stranger  becomes violent towards The Teacher  and chases him away. He then runs towards the camera and grabs it, screaming, 'Forty days!' into it. A young girl watches a news broadcast where a woman  is showing photographs of her missing son, The Teacher. On the beach at dawn, people gather at the water's edge. The Stranger walks into the water and waits there. From the sand dunes The Teacher, dressed in bedraggled clothing, appears and walks the to water. He removes his clothes and walks into the sea towards The Stranger, who pushes him under the water. When The Teacher emerges, he cries and is carried to shore where he is wrapped in a cloth and carried away while the people sing, 'He is come.' Later that day there is a gathering at the beach, where the council await a visit from ICU, a company who has worked closely with the town for years. Entertainers perform for the crowds but are interrupted by The Stranger, who digs a door out of the sand. He stands the door up and from behind it appears a young boy with the likeness of The Teacher. As soon as it begins, the event is over and the celebrations continue until the Company Man  arrives by boat, accompanied by his Security Chief  and full security team. The Company Man begins addressing the people of the town but is interrupted when a woman  strapped with explosives emerges from the crowd. A masked man who has hijacked the tannoy system  threatens to detonate the bomb if the company do not leave the town. Before anything happens, The Teacher appears at the waves and walks to the woman, talking to her. He discovers that her name is Joanna and asks her to tell him her story. He removes the bomb and the two embrace, but before any of the security or police can speak with them, they are gone. The bomber is arrested and taken away. Later that day ICU holds a conference at the town hall to discuss their plans for the town. The Company man speaks to the mayor about why he can't tell the people of the town that they will all be moved on, and that he must lie to them. The Company Man takes to the mic and explains to the people of the town that in addition to the M4 motorway that runs through the town, the company will be adding a new road, entitled the Passover Project. He explains that families who's houses stand in the way will be rehomed. The people of the town start to revolt, until one woman is shot by the Security Chief. The Teacher appears and cradles her. When questioned by the Company Man about what he wants, he replies, 'I came here to listen!' The teacher gathers more followers; a fisherman, Peter , Alfie , a man who is haunted by the ghosts of people who used to live in his street, homeless twins with no name who he calls Legion , his brother whom he doesn't recognise, Kyle  and a musician, Simon . At the shopping centre, his mother finds him, but he doesn't recognise her. Later that night, The Teacher and his friends celebrate at Peter's local club. The Teacher is volunteered to draw the raffle, and his mother approaches him again. She gives him a photograph of him and his daughter, who he doesn't remember. The encounter visibly moves him, and he calls Joanne into a back room. There he asks her to give him up to ICU's security, and she reluctantly agrees. The friends stumble outside drunkenly, and there The Teacher sees visions of three women, his daughter, his wife and his mother-in-law. He then sees a vision of the Security Chief, covered in blood and adorned with antlers. He asks him to tell him his story, but the vision replies, 'I have no story. I am.' The visions disappear and The Teacher notices a roofer at work on a nearby house. The roofer is his father, and for a brief moment, he recognises him. His father explain that he has lost a piece of slate from the roof and asks his son to find it. When he does, it's broken, and his father explains that sometimes you have to sacrifice one piece of slate to realise that the roof needs to be fixed. The Teacher reluctantly agrees and is arrested by a local police office, Sgt. Phillips . He is taken to the back of a flat-bed truck where the Security Chief tells him he knows everything about him, about his failed marriage and how he never gets to see his daughter any more. He accuses The Teacher of leading an uprising against ICU and tells him that the people of the town look to him as their king. At that moment, Peter is being quizzed by a local news team about whether he is affiliated with The Teacher, but he denies ever knowing him. The Teacher reluctantly admits his is the king of the town, knowing that he is the piece of slate that is sacrificed to save the whole roof. The following day The Teacher and the bomber from the beach, Barry Absalum are tried. Barry is set free and The Teacher is found guilty by the Company Man. Peter tries to stop the events happening by declaring that he does know The Teacher, but it is too late. He is dragged into the town centre and is beaten by the security team. They dress him in a nighty and place a crown of barbed wire upon his head to humiliate him. Sgt Phillips and the rest of the local police refuse to participate. The Teacher is bundled into a van and driven to a local stonemasons, where he is handed a cross. He then follows Simon's drum, and a procession of all the people in the town begin to walk. The Teacher collapses and is carried into the town centre, where his mother bathes his wounds and replaces his crown with one of roses. The procession continues until they reach the beach, where a podium built of all of the doors of the people of the town stands. The Teacher is stripped and nailed to the cross and raised above the town. As he hangs, picture of his daughter comes alive in his mind and suddenly he remembers. We cut to The Teacher's video diary of his forty missing days, where he flees to the hills surrounding the town due to pressure in his life. He lives happily in the hills, free from his troubles, remarking about the M4 motorway that scars the town. He states that 'Nobody stops in Port Talbot'. On the fortieth day, when journeying into the town for food, he gets lost and begins to forget who he is. It is at this moment that he stubles down to the beach where he is held under the water by The Stranger. With his memory restored, The Teacher begins to cry out about all of the memories of the town until the skyline is lit with a burst of light and all of the town is brought back to life with old memories. After he dies, his followers wrap him in cloth and lower him gently, where his mother cradles his body and sings to him. Joanne approaches to remove the cloth to show the town their hero one last time, but when she does, his body is gone and in his place are hundreds of flowers. The Stranger appears on the podium, exclaiming, 'It is finished, it has begun!' and pulls back his hood to reveal himself as The Teacher.

Peter tries to stop the events happening by declaring that he does know The Teacher, but it is too late. He is dragged into the town centre and is beaten by the security team. They dress him in a nighty and place a crown of barbed wire upon his head to humiliate him. Sgt Phillips and the rest of the local police refuse to participate. The Teacher is bundled into a van and driven to a local stonemasons, where he is handed a cross. He then follows Simon's drum, and a procession of all the people in the town begin to walk. The Teacher collapses and is carried into the town centre, where his mother bathes his wounds and replaces his crown with one of roses. The procession continues until they reach the beach, where a podium built of all of the doors of the people of the town stands. The Teacher is stripped and nailed to the cross and raised above the town. As he hangs, picture of his daughter comes alive in his mind and suddenly he remembers. We cut to The Teacher's video diary of his forty missing days, where he flees to the hills surrounding the town due to pressure in his life. He lives happily in the hills, free from his troubles, remarking about the M4 motorway that scars the town. He states that 'Nobody stops in Port Talbot'. On the fortieth day, when journeying into the town for food, he gets lost and begins to forget who he is. It is at this moment that he stubles down to the beach where he is held under the water by The Stranger. With his memory restored, The Teacher begins to cry out about all of the memories of the town until the skyline is lit with a burst of light and all of the town is brought back to life with old memories. After he dies, his followers wrap him in cloth and lower him gently, where his mother cradles his body and sings to him. Joanne approaches to remove the cloth to show the town their hero one last time, but when she does, his body is gone and in his place are hundreds of flowers. The Stranger appears on the podium, exclaiming, 'It is finished, it has begun!' and pulls back his hood to reveal himself as The Teacher.

The Stranger  becomes violent towards The Teacher  and chases him away. He then runs towards the camera and grabs it, screaming, 'Forty days!' into it. A young girl watches a news broadcast where a woman  is showing photographs of her missing son, The Teacher. On the beach at dawn, people gather at the water's edge. The Stranger walks into the water and waits there. From the sand dunes The Teacher, dressed in bedraggled clothing, appears and walks the to water. He removes his clothes and walks into the sea towards The Stranger, who pushes him under the water. When The Teacher emerges, he cries and is carried to shore where he is wrapped in a cloth and carried away while the people sing, 'He is come.' Later that day there is a gathering at the beach, where the council await a visit from ICU, a company who has worked closely with the town for years. Entertainers perform for the crowds but are interrupted by The Stranger, who digs a door out of the sand. He stands the door up and from behind it appears a young boy with the likeness of The Teacher. As soon as it begins, the event is over and the celebrations continue until the Company Man  arrives by boat, accompanied by his Security Chief  and full security team. The Company Man begins addressing the people of the town but is interrupted when a woman  strapped with explosives emerges from the crowd. A masked man who has hijacked the tannoy system  threatens to detonate the bomb if the company do not leave the town. Before anything happens, The Teacher appears at the waves and walks to the woman, talking to her. He discovers that her name is Joanna and asks her to tell him her story. He removes the bomb and the two embrace, but before any of the security or police can speak with them, they are gone. The bomber is arrested and taken away. Later that day ICU holds a conference at the town hall to discuss their plans for the town. The Company man speaks to the mayor about why he can't tell the people of the town that they will all be moved on, and that he must lie to them. The Company Man takes to the mic and explains to the people of the town that in addition to the M4 motorway that runs through the town, the company will be adding a new road, entitled the Passover Project. He explains that families who's houses stand in the way will be rehomed. The people of the town start to revolt, until one woman is shot by the Security Chief. The Teacher appears and cradles her. When questioned by the Company Man about what he wants, he replies, 'I came here to listen!' The teacher gathers more followers; a fisherman, Peter , Alfie , a man who is haunted by the ghosts of people who used to live in his street, homeless twins with no name who he calls Legion , his brother whom he doesn't recognise, Kyle  and a musician, Simon . At the shopping centre, his mother finds him, but he doesn't recognise her. Later that night, The Teacher and his friends celebrate at Peter's local club. The Teacher is volunteered to draw the raffle, and his mother approaches him again. She gives him a photograph of him and his daughter, who he doesn't remember. The encounter visibly moves him, and he calls Joanne into a back room. There he asks her to give him up to ICU's security, and she reluctantly agrees. The friends stumble outside drunkenly, and there The Teacher sees visions of three women, his daughter, his wife and his mother-in-law. He then sees a vision of the Security Chief, covered in blood and adorned with antlers. He asks him to tell him his story, but the vision replies, 'I have no story. I am.' The visions disappear and The Teacher notices a roofer at work on a nearby house. The roofer is his father, and for a brief moment, he recognises him. His father explain that he has lost a piece of slate from the roof and asks his son to find it. When he does, it's broken, and his father explains that sometimes you have to sacrifice one piece of slate to realise that the roof needs to be fixed. The Teacher reluctantly agrees and is arrested by a local police office, Sgt. Phillips . He is taken to the back of a flat-bed truck where the Security Chief tells him he knows everything about him, about his failed marriage and how he never gets to see his daughter any more. He accuses The Teacher of leading an uprising against ICU and tells him that the people of the town look to him as their king. At that moment, Peter is being quizzed by a local news team about whether he is affiliated with The Teacher, but he denies ever knowing him. The Teacher reluctantly admits his is the king of the town, knowing that he is the piece of slate that is sacrificed to save the whole roof. The following day The Teacher and the bomber from the beach, Barry Absalum are tried. Barry is set free and The Teacher is found guilty by the Company Man.

A police officer escorts Missy home, where she is confronted by ""the April Fools Killer"" - Marlin, who has killed the officer and the one stationed at his house. Marlin claims that he was only one affected by Melvin's death, his life falling to shambles after it while everyone else easily moved on, enraging him. Marlin attacks Missy, but she manages to briefly incapacitate him and get outside, a recovered Marlin eventually giving chase. Marlin soon catches up with Missy, only to be die when she hits him with a rock, and turns his own blade on him.

Thirteen days into the journey, Porky is writing in the Ship's Log that he is nearing land, ""...I hope, I hope, I hope"". A fish spots the Petunia coming his way and swims to the bottom of the ocean to tell his friends and says, ""Hey guys, a ship is coming through!""  and they all swim to near the surface, just under the boat. A swordfish comes along and cuts a hole in the bottom of the boat and all of Porky's goods fall to the bottom of the ocean! As Porky falls out too, the swordfish pushes him back into the boat and closes up the hole. The swordfish unscrews his ""sword"" from his face, and gives it to a nearby fish to stand guard . Out of the sinking goods falls a lunchbox and when it hits bottom, opens up to form a canteen where a fish inside wearing a chef's hat is flipping burgers. A group of seahorses see a record player and as it starts playing, they swim onto the rotating record and form a merry-go-round. Smaller fish jump on their backs, imitating children on a ride. A fish swallows a teapot which whistles a tune while emitting steam and the opening and closing of the lid. Another fish swallows a clock with a moving pendulum and as he walks away, the pendulum keeps swinging. As Porky lifts the hole cover to see what happening , he gets water squirted in his face by the sentry fish. Another fish swallows a radio and as the radio announcer  is speaking, the fish looks around for someone speaking and does not realize the sound is coming from the radio. The announcer describes how two giant bombers dropped a bomb on a small village, and the fish goes through all the motions of the bombing and gunfire sounds . As the shelling comes to a stop, the fish wipes sweat from his brow, only to have a program called ""Gangsta Busters"" begin playing including the sounds of bombing and gunfire, and goes through all the motions again until he is bounced off the ocean floor which causes the radio to be up-chucked. Bowls and boxes are the next to follow, forming a hotel with a ballroom inside. Two electric eels swim by and form the marquee ""Holly"" and ""wood"" above the entrance and begin blinking on and off. Two other fish enter with flashlights on forming spotlights, as seen in front of hotels and theaters with big events and movie premiers in Hollywood that were common at the time. Two other fish have bowler hats drop on them, and as they turn toward the camera, acquire a likeness of Laurel and Hardy, and they swim into the Hotel. Another fish steps into some large shoes, and impersonates a Greta Garbo character and she says, ""I want to be alone"", a line in the 1932 classic Garbo movie ""Grand Hotel"". Another fish swallows an hourglass lamp and takes on the likeness of Mae West, complete with jewels and parasol, utters, ""Come up and see me sometime"" as she steps into the Hollywood Legion Stadium to watch a boxing match. There are two boxing fish fighting on the keys of a typewriter in the stadium, and as the carriage comes to the end of the line, the typewriter's ding is heard, and each fish backs into his own corner, and another fish pushes the carriage back to the beginning of a new line. The keys spell out what is happening in the fight. Back to Porky, he's now frowning because all of his goods have been lost, and puts a worm on a hook and lowers it into the water. The sentry fish sees this and pulls out his own fishing pole with baited hook and the worm jumps onto the hook and the sentry fish reels him in and eats him! Later, the ballroom guests are partying and waving their drinking glasses around when a spotlight appears on the curtain. As the curtain rises, we see some pretty dancing legs and as the curtain rises further, it turns out to be a 10-legged octopus! The Mae West fish dances with something resembling a walrus or seal; her bustline and his waistline fit together perfectly as they dance. The fish that swallowed the clock stands still as his hips move to the beat of the music. A whale appears under Porky's boat and the sentry fish knocks on the hole cover. As Porky opens the cover and says, ""Who's there?"" the whale spouts water from his blowhole, which forces Porky back onto the boat. A waterspout appears in the moonlit evening sky and as we see the dancing fish again, the announcer comes on and says there's a waterspout approaching the Boola-Boola islands. The fish casually go back to their dancing until he says, ""Well, come on you guys, SCRAM!"" and all of the fish panic and run for their lives. The force of the waterspout picks up all of the goods and drops them back into the Petunia, and Porky sails off into the distance. The sentry fish spits water, and Porky comes back and sprays him with a spritzer-bottle, and the fish starts crying and the cartoon comes to a close."

A wolf rising it's stem and stern. It sailed drip blood, red. These things served but one purpose, to strike fear and terror into the hearts of any who came across them. A group of Vikings on a ship were headed for the ends of the Earth, which turns out to be a mysterious island. The narrator continues Each stroke, each painful breathe, they believed it brought them ever closer to the ends of the Earth. But onward they pushed, for the ends of the Earth they sought. Glory, Honor. These things awaited them there. But so did something else. Freyja, says it is Lingfei . Thor believes it to be a place to build a new kingdom for themselves. But he corrects himself, saying that it would be the kingdom of his brother, Baldur. But Baldur suggests to give it to their elder brother, Ulfrich, he joked about the island's weather suiting his temper. Upon arriving, Thor has deja vu-ing, as he had been there before. Freyja suggests that he has memories of his past life. Thor then said to her that if he lived before, then he had died as well. He said that was a mistake he would not make twise. Thor and Aegir go out scouting, but soon a werewolf grabs Aegir and runs off with him. Thor makes it back after two other werewolves run him up a tree, and soon the Vikings rally and go looking for Aegir. Instead, they find a village. Inside, were some starving people who have been walled into a house for months eating grubs in the dirt. They explain that they came here like the Vikings and then were attacked and trapped by the werewolves. Baldur decides to leave some men to guard the village as they continue looking for Aegir. Thor has a vision of a great warrior fighting a giant sea serpent, with a mighty hammer. Freyja says that Thor saw the Hammer of the Gods. Back at the village, the guards are attacked and killed by werewolves. As the group was crossing a wooden bridge, Freyja sees a vision of Baldur sacrificing his life. Then the group hears screaming, Baldur tells everyone to go back to the village. But when they got there, their men were gone. Baldur decides they go back to the ship to get the rest of the crew. Thor has another vision of the warrior holding the hammer to the heavens, the lightning struck the hammer, filling it with power. When Thor saw this, he felt the lightning itself! Freyja tells him that his visions are clues to finding the hammer and it is at the top of the mountain on the island. When they reach the shore, their guards are gone, and the ship disappeared, so the vikings are trapped. They go back to the village for the night, but the people there are also missing. The vikings set up the fort and then wait for night. The werewolves run in and soon everyone is fighting. The Vikings make a good stand, they kill several of the werewolves to only one Viking loss. Thor cut off a werewolf's head. The werewolves retreat and drag off their dead, except the head of one werewolf, which Thor stuck on a pick. The werewolf head is soon a human head, and the Vikings figure out what their enemies are. Freyja also finds a bowl that had the inscription “Beware the sons of Loki” who are Jörmungandr the Midgard Serpent, and Fenris the wolf. To give weight to the Fenris name, inside a cave, a werewolf reverts to human form, Hel, and report in to Fenris. He tells Hel to get Thor and kill everyone else. So she interrogates some prisoners, and uses a werewolf named Skull to torture them. Back at the village, Ulfrich is angered over an imagined Thor and Sif affair. Ulfrich challenges Thor to a duel. After a minute or two Baldur stops it, then Ulfrich just leaves. Seconds later, Hel comes to see Ulfrich and asks him to join them, and also kisses him. The Vikings head to the mountain, to search for the hammer, but run into Ulfrich and two werewolves. After words are exchanged, Ulfrich fights Baldur as the rest are told to run. Ulfrich slices Baldur in the back, but Baldur then runs, and he gets on the bridge they were at before. As the werewolves also get on the bridge, Baldur stops in the middle and destroys the bridge! The bridge falls and Baldur and the werewolves die. The Vikings set traps for the werewolves which basically means waiting at the bottom of a hill, and tossing spears up at them. This strategy proves deadly for the werewolves. Ulfrich sneers and then heads back to the werewolf base. That night, an old man falls out of a tree, the Vikings run to the man named, Vali, who tells the same story the villagers did, so they cut off a finger to see if it grows back. It doesn’t, and Vali tells them the story of the Hammer of the Gods. He told them the hammer fell from the heavens, a mighty gift from Odin himself. It's power was so great, that only one mortal man could wield it. He tells them that on that very island they were standing on, the chapion killed Jörmungandr at the same time it killed him, so the hero was victorious, but at a cost, his life. Vali then said that Odin was pleased though, so it was written that the champion would one return, and reclaim his place as the god of thunder. Thor sees another vision, seeing that he was the chosen one to wield the Hammer of the Gods. So Thor plans to get the hammer, kill Fenris, and find their ship to leave. At the werewolf base, they see their ship near the hideout, Thor sends the Viking Brothers to secure it for departure, while the rest sneak in the back door. Ulfrich is at the back waiting for them, so he and Thor fight as the girls and Vali sneak inside. Thor stabs Ulfrich in the chest, but Ulfrich just laughs, and partially morphs into a werewolf. Ulfrich throws Thor's sword up a tree, Thor jumps, grabs his sword, and slices Ulfrich in two at the same time. Inside, Sif, Freyja, and Vali kill the captured and mortally wounded Viking Aegir, to free him from his own pain, and then confronted by Hel. She says Vali is also after the Hammer, but he disappeares. Now it is a lady fight! Thor almost comes in, but they tell him to go after the hammer, so he goes and finds it. Thor also finds Fenris, who tells him he had waited a long time for Thor's return. He even calls Thor, Son of Odin, meaning Odin is Thor's father. Thor asks Fenris why he keeps the hammer close. Fenris replies that it is because Thor is drawn to the hammer, his lust for it. Thor says he'll need it back now, then Fenris tells him to come and try to take it. Then the two fight. At the women fight, Freyja is killed, but then Sif kills Hel. Sif tells the dead Freyja that she will see her again, on the plains of Asgard. Then Sif goes and distracts Fenris, while Thor grabs the Hammer and smashes Fenris' head. Fenris is dead, Thor and Sif hug each other and leave. Then they go out the front way, and find the werewolves waiting for them. Thor goes over to them, and slams the hammer down onto the ground, and a thunderous shockwave kills all the werewolves. Thor and Sif hug, while Vali appears, and asks if he could touch the hammer. Thor asks him how he would know Vali wouldn't use it against him. Vali said that only Thor could wield it. But Thor says, I'll think about it. They all laughed. Then they went down to the ship. The Viking Brothers lived, Thor shows them the hammer, and yell with joy. The narrator tells us, So, they sailed away from Midgard's edge, each lost in their own silent contemplation. Though they dwarn the day, they left more on that Isle, than they'd taken. So that's what they did, and sailed back home.

A call is placed about a road traffic accident on Shoreditch Road. An ambulance is dispatched to the scene of the incident. A series of scenes illustrate careless behaviour that could lead to road accidents. This includes a boy running out into the road in front of a car, a drunk man behind the wheel who nearly knocks over a pedestrian, and a cyclist with faulty brakes who runs into the back of a lorry. Two further stories are shown. Mr Smith is driving to work along a familiar route, cutting corners to save time. On one morning, he almost has a collision with a lorry when going around a bend. Miss Jones is a pedestrian who pays little attention to oncoming traffic, assuming that vehicles will always stop to allow her to cross. One day, she is fatally hit by a driver whose brakes are faulty. A man is shown leaving a cinema in which he has been watching the road safety film. He has paid little attention to the film, assuming that ""accidents only happen to other people"". As the walks out into the road, the screen cuts to a view of a ""Get Home Safe and Sound"" poster, accompanied by the sound of screeching brakes."

Jacques Renard  is struggling with depression following the untimely death of his beloved wife, Chloé. After six months in a mental hospital following a suicide attempt, the disheveled and lonely Le Havre police lieutenant is still haunted by visions of his wife. One day, Renard finds a mysterious woman  waiting for him in his car. She implores him to visit the manager of the Hotel Normandy, Antoine Bérangère , in nearby Deauville in Room 401. She insists that only Renard can help her, and then leaves. Renard drives to Deauville to the luxury hotel where he meets Bérangère's thirty-nine year old son, Camille , and learns that Bérangère, who worked as manager of the Hotel Normandy for nearly four decades, vanished forty-eight hours earlier under suspicious circumstances. Without identification or money, he took his Mercedes, which he hadn't driven in years, and simply vanished, leaving everything behind except his hunting rifle. When Renard asks about Room 401, Camille insists there is no such room at the hotel. While searching Bérangère's room, Renard discovers a key to Room 401. After a quick search, he finds the room which is decorated with old framed photographs, portraits, and momentos of Bérangère's deceased first wife—a film actress who looks like the mysterious woman he met in his car. Old newspaper clippings reveal that the actress, Victoria Benutti , died in a car accident in 1970, exactly 36 years ago to the day of Bérangère's disappearance. Camille is annoyed by Renard's presence and inquiry, and Renard's partner Pierre  is convinced that this is a simple suicide case. Renard, however, believes that something far more sinister is happening, and the suspicious actions of Antoine's wheelchair-bound second wife, Mélanie , convinces Renard that foul play has occurred. At the hotel, Renard meets a Duchess  who tells him how the ""ghost of Victoria"" still haunts the hotel after all these years. Soonafter, he sees the mysterious woman and chases her through the hotel and onto the roof, but she eludes him. Shortly after the police discover Bérangère's car abandoned on the cliffs at Deauville, a body presumed to be that of Antoine Bérangère turns up in the city morgue, the skull and face obliterated by a gunshot blast from Bérangère's rifle. While investigating the crime scene at the foot of the cliffs, Renard spots the mysterious woman watching from a distance, and chases after her following her Volvo. After losing her trail, he stops at a gas station inquiring about her car, and by chance learns that shortly after Victoria's car accident in 1970, a man in a Mercedes stopped at the station and called for an ambulance. Renard suspects it was Bérangère. Renard drives to the cemetery where Victoria  are buried and finds the mysterious woman's Volvo with a DVD inside labeled ""Lucie 1982"". Later he watches the DVD of home movies of a teenager—scenes of her undressing and being molested—taken by Bérangère. In search of Lucie's identity, Renard goes back to the mental hospital where he is still being treated and the head nurse confirms that Lucie was indeed treated at the hospital while he was there following her own attempted suicide. Initially Renard has no memory of her, but later he remembers her and understands that the mysterious woman he's been pursuing is Lucie, the daughter of Victoria. Looking for Lucie's address, Renard steals the hospital computer containing patient records and goes out searching for her, with his partner Pierre in hot pursuit. Renard is eventually captured and taken to jail. Pierre and his colleagues believe he is mentally unstable. Camille visits Renard in jail and tells him about his nanny, Evelyne , who disappeared after the crash. Camille remembers being in the car with his mother Victoria and her new lover, Albert, when Bérangère ran them off the road in 1970. Later at the hotel, Camille confronts his stepmother, Mélanie, who reveals that Victoria and her new lover were taking Camille away from Bérangère. Camille then remembers that at the crash site, Bérangère left Camille in the car while taking the baby Lucie with him. Bérangère later entrusted the baby's care and upbringing to Camille's former nanny, Evelyne. Camille eventually finds Evelyne's apartment where he discovers a DVD of home movies showing her being molested by Bérangère. Meanwhile, Lucie visits Bérangère who was wounded by the tramp he killed—the same tramp his family was planning to cremate. Obsessed with the memory of Victoria, and after years of molesting Lucie, Bérangère staged his own death so that he and Lucie could run away together. Traumatized by years of abuse, Lucie tried but was unable to kill Bérangère. After Pierre bails him out of jail, Renard goes back to the morgue convinced that the body belongs to some tramp, not Bérangère whom he now knows has been molesting Lucie and controlling her for years. Renard learns from Mélanie that Bérangère might be hiding on the family yacht, Victoria. At the yacht, Renard discovers Bérangère preparing to escape with a bag full of money. As Renard is about to arrest him, Lucie steps forward with a gun and ties up the surprised lieutenant. Once out to sea, Bérangère prepares to kill Renard, but Lucie lets go of the mast which knocks Bérangère into the ocean where he perishes. She unties Renard and they return to Deauville. Sometime later, Lucie meets Renard on the cliffs at Deauville, and they embrace and kiss."

While investigating the crime scene at the foot of the cliffs, Renard spots the mysterious woman watching from a distance, and chases after her following her Volvo. After losing her trail, he stops at a gas station inquiring about her car, and by chance learns that shortly after Victoria's car accident in 1970, a man in a Mercedes stopped at the station and called for an ambulance. Renard suspects it was Bérangère. Renard drives to the cemetery where Victoria  are buried and finds the mysterious woman's Volvo with a DVD inside labeled ""Lucie 1982"". Later he watches the DVD of home movies of a teenager—scenes of her undressing and being molested—taken by Bérangère. In search of Lucie's identity, Renard goes back to the mental hospital where he is still being treated and the head nurse confirms that Lucie was indeed treated at the hospital while he was there following her own attempted suicide. Initially Renard has no memory of her, but later he remembers her and understands that the mysterious woman he's been pursuing is Lucie, the daughter of Victoria. Looking for Lucie's address, Renard steals the hospital computer containing patient records and goes out searching for her, with his partner Pierre in hot pursuit. Renard is eventually captured and taken to jail. Pierre and his colleagues believe he is mentally unstable. Camille visits Renard in jail and tells him about his nanny, Evelyne , who disappeared after the crash. Camille remembers being in the car with his mother Victoria and her new lover, Albert, when Bérangère ran them off the road in 1970. Later at the hotel, Camille confronts his stepmother, Mélanie, who reveals that Victoria and her new lover were taking Camille away from Bérangère. Camille then remembers that at the crash site, Bérangère left Camille in the car while taking the baby Lucie with him. Bérangère later entrusted the baby's care and upbringing to Camille's former nanny, Evelyne. Camille eventually finds Evelyne's apartment where he discovers a DVD of home movies showing her being molested by Bérangère. Meanwhile, Lucie visits Bérangère who was wounded by the tramp he killed—the same tramp his family was planning to cremate. Obsessed with the memory of Victoria, and after years of molesting Lucie, Bérangère staged his own death so that he and Lucie could run away together. Traumatized by years of abuse, Lucie tried but was unable to kill Bérangère. After Pierre bails him out of jail, Renard goes back to the morgue convinced that the body belongs to some tramp, not Bérangère whom he now knows has been molesting Lucie and controlling her for years. Renard learns from Mélanie that Bérangère might be hiding on the family yacht, Victoria. At the yacht, Renard discovers Bérangère preparing to escape with a bag full of money. As Renard is about to arrest him, Lucie steps forward with a gun and ties up the surprised lieutenant. Once out to sea, Bérangère prepares to kill Renard, but Lucie lets go of the mast which knocks Bérangère into the ocean where he perishes. She unties Renard and they return to Deauville. Sometime later, Lucie meets Renard on the cliffs at Deauville, and they embrace and kiss."

Jacques Renard  is struggling with depression following the untimely death of his beloved wife, Chloé. After six months in a mental hospital following a suicide attempt, the disheveled and lonely Le Havre police lieutenant is still haunted by visions of his wife. One day, Renard finds a mysterious woman  waiting for him in his car. She implores him to visit the manager of the Hotel Normandy, Antoine Bérangère , in nearby Deauville in Room 401. She insists that only Renard can help her, and then leaves. Renard drives to Deauville to the luxury hotel where he meets Bérangère's thirty-nine year old son, Camille , and learns that Bérangère, who worked as manager of the Hotel Normandy for nearly four decades, vanished forty-eight hours earlier under suspicious circumstances. Without identification or money, he took his Mercedes, which he hadn't driven in years, and simply vanished, leaving everything behind except his hunting rifle. When Renard asks about Room 401, Camille insists there is no such room at the hotel. While searching Bérangère's room, Renard discovers a key to Room 401. After a quick search, he finds the room which is decorated with old framed photographs, portraits, and momentos of Bérangère's deceased first wife—a film actress who looks like the mysterious woman he met in his car. Old newspaper clippings reveal that the actress, Victoria Benutti , died in a car accident in 1970, exactly 36 years ago to the day of Bérangère's disappearance. Camille is annoyed by Renard's presence and inquiry, and Renard's partner Pierre  is convinced that this is a simple suicide case.

Renard drives to Deauville to the luxury hotel where he meets Bérangère's thirty-nine year old son, Camille , and learns that Bérangère, who worked as manager of the Hotel Normandy for nearly four decades, vanished forty-eight hours earlier under suspicious circumstances. Without identification or money, he took his Mercedes, which he hadn't driven in years, and simply vanished, leaving everything behind except his hunting rifle. When Renard asks about Room 401, Camille insists there is no such room at the hotel. While searching Bérangère's room, Renard discovers a key to Room 401. After a quick search, he finds the room which is decorated with old framed photographs, portraits, and momentos of Bérangère's deceased first wife—a film actress who looks like the mysterious woman he met in his car. Old newspaper clippings reveal that the actress, Victoria Benutti , died in a car accident in 1970, exactly 36 years ago to the day of Bérangère's disappearance. Camille is annoyed by Renard's presence and inquiry, and Renard's partner Pierre  is convinced that this is a simple suicide case. Renard, however, believes that something far more sinister is happening, and the suspicious actions of Antoine's wheelchair-bound second wife, Mélanie , convinces Renard that foul play has occurred. At the hotel, Renard meets a Duchess  who tells him how the ""ghost of Victoria"" still haunts the hotel after all these years. Soonafter, he sees the mysterious woman and chases her through the hotel and onto the roof, but she eludes him. Shortly after the police discover Bérangère's car abandoned on the cliffs at Deauville, a body presumed to be that of Antoine Bérangère turns up in the city morgue, the skull and face obliterated by a gunshot blast from Bérangère's rifle. While investigating the crime scene at the foot of the cliffs, Renard spots the mysterious woman watching from a distance, and chases after her following her Volvo. After losing her trail, he stops at a gas station inquiring about her car, and by chance learns that shortly after Victoria's car accident in 1970, a man in a Mercedes stopped at the station and called for an ambulance. Renard suspects it was Bérangère. Renard drives to the cemetery where Victoria  are buried and finds the mysterious woman's Volvo with a DVD inside labeled ""Lucie 1982"". Later he watches the DVD of home movies of a teenager—scenes of her undressing and being molested—taken by Bérangère. In search of Lucie's identity, Renard goes back to the mental hospital where he is still being treated and the head nurse confirms that Lucie was indeed treated at the hospital while he was there following her own attempted suicide. Initially Renard has no memory of her, but later he remembers her and understands that the mysterious woman he's been pursuing is Lucie, the daughter of Victoria. Looking for Lucie's address, Renard steals the hospital computer containing patient records and goes out searching for her, with his partner Pierre in hot pursuit. Renard is eventually captured and taken to jail. Pierre and his colleagues believe he is mentally unstable. Camille visits Renard in jail and tells him about his nanny, Evelyne , who disappeared after the crash. Camille remembers being in the car with his mother Victoria and her new lover, Albert, when Bérangère ran them off the road in 1970. Later at the hotel, Camille confronts his stepmother, Mélanie, who reveals that Victoria and her new lover were taking Camille away from Bérangère. Camille then remembers that at the crash site, Bérangère left Camille in the car while taking the baby Lucie with him. Bérangère later entrusted the baby's care and upbringing to Camille's former nanny, Evelyne. Camille eventually finds Evelyne's apartment where he discovers a DVD of home movies showing her being molested by Bérangère. Meanwhile, Lucie visits Bérangère who was wounded by the tramp he killed—the same tramp his family was planning to cremate. Obsessed with the memory of Victoria, and after years of molesting Lucie, Bérangère staged his own death so that he and Lucie could run away together. Traumatized by years of abuse, Lucie tried but was unable to kill Bérangère. After Pierre bails him out of jail, Renard goes back to the morgue convinced that the body belongs to some tramp, not Bérangère whom he now knows has been molesting Lucie and controlling her for years. Renard learns from Mélanie that Bérangère might be hiding on the family yacht, Victoria. At the yacht, Renard discovers Bérangère preparing to escape with a bag full of money. As Renard is about to arrest him, Lucie steps forward with a gun and ties up the surprised lieutenant. Once out to sea, Bérangère prepares to kill Renard, but Lucie lets go of the mast which knocks Bérangère into the ocean where he perishes. She unties Renard and they return to Deauville. Sometime later, Lucie meets Renard on the cliffs at Deauville, and they embrace and kiss."

2736433In the beginning of this film, Leo is an adult and has just learned that his mate, Lyra, has just given birth to two cubs: Lune  and Lukio. After a grand celebration, the scene changes drastically to a bustling city where a man named Ham Egg is travelling from jeweler to jeweler to try and sell a special stone he found in the Bajalu Jungle. After being turned down at every pawn shop and jeweler he goes to, the jewelers all inform someone of Ham Egg's whereabouts, and soon he is hauled away in a black car by intimidating men in black suits. As it turns out, the stone that he's been trying to sell is really the ""Moonlight Stone"", a mineral that could be used as a power source and save the world from an impending energy crisis. A scientific organization led by Dr. Plus and Dr. Minus seek the help of Ham Egg to lead them to the source of the Moonlight Stone so it can be salvaged and used to help humanity. Ham Egg, however, is only interested in money, but is soon persuaded by Dr. Plus who is well aware of Ham Egg's illegal poaching activities. Ham Egg agrees to work for them, but demands to be put in charge of the search. Accompanying Ham Egg is Mr. Lemonade of the organization, and Dr. Moustache who is already stationed in the jungle. When they arrive in the jungle, Dr. Moustache and Mr. Lemonade are shocked by Ham Egg and his ""friends"" who want only destroy jungle forest land and shoot any animal they come across. Dr. Moustache constantly argues with them over being respectful to nature, as Mr. Lemonade records everything that happens in his journal. As Leo's son, Lune, becomes more and more curious of the human world, Leo continues to protect the animals of the jungle from whatever may threaten them, including Ham Egg's sinister actions, dissent amongst the animals, and a deadly disease that is affecting the animals. With his domain violated by humans in a relentless search for the Moonlight Stone, their actions bring death to the jungle and break up Leo's family. Leaving Leo with the heavy responsibility of bringing peace to the jungle, his family, and even the humans. Lune leaves the jungle behind, and travels by a log in the water to a nearby city. Lune is found by fishers and taken to a circus. A girl from the circus decides to take care of him, and he befriends a rat named Jack. Eventually a bird from the jungle finds Lune and tells him of how the disease is killing off many animals and she leaves with her flock. Lune is frightened by the idea that his family may be dead. Eventually there is a fire in the circus and Lune gets all the animals to help put it out. Lune, Jack and, the girl who took care of Lune bid their goodbyes and Lune sneaks onto a boat that will help him get back to Africa. In the jungle, Lyra is affected by the deadly disease and shortly dies. Although Lukio comes down with the same ailment, Dr. Moustache is able to cure her. We see near the end of the film that she gets better. However, we do not see her in the rest of the film. Leo, heartbroken by the disintegration of his family, decides to lead the humans to the center of the mountain where there are many moonlight stones. Many hunters are lost on the way, but finally they arrive. As they discover the stones, Ham Egg shoots at the trio. At the last minute, Mr. Lemonade jumps in the way and takes the bullet himself and dies. They soon discover the stones, and Ham Egg, blinded by greed, steals one of the stones and swallows it so no one else can have it, but dies shortly afterwards because the stone poisoned him. Dr. Moustache takes Leo and together they escape back down the mountain. It is then that Moustache suddenly realizes that the lion has gone blind. He rids of the stone they got because he believes it has ruined enough lives. The film ends with Lune returning from the human's world and Dr. Moustache taking the cub to see his father's pelt. Leo died on the journey by stabbing himself with Dr. Moustache's knife. He did this so Dr. Moustache could eat his flesh and clothe himself with Leo's fur so he can tell the humans what they need to know. Lune then begins nuzzling his fur. Dr. Moustache tells Lune about what his father did, ""Your father was as wise as he was brave, and you should know what he did to save the world. He was the most courageous soul I've ever met, a true king who gave his life to save the land."" Then both of them head out into a meadow and see clouds in the shape of Leo.  A major story change made for this movie version is that while all the animals communicate with each other, they do not talk to the humans. This change is in direct opposition to Tezuka's stated premise behind his original Jungle Emperor story: that an inter-species society of animals must include humans as well.{{cite web}}

As Leo's son, Lune, becomes more and more curious of the human world, Leo continues to protect the animals of the jungle from whatever may threaten them, including Ham Egg's sinister actions, dissent amongst the animals, and a deadly disease that is affecting the animals. With his domain violated by humans in a relentless search for the Moonlight Stone, their actions bring death to the jungle and break up Leo's family. Leaving Leo with the heavy responsibility of bringing peace to the jungle, his family, and even the humans. Lune leaves the jungle behind, and travels by a log in the water to a nearby city. Lune is found by fishers and taken to a circus. A girl from the circus decides to take care of him, and he befriends a rat named Jack. Eventually a bird from the jungle finds Lune and tells him of how the disease is killing off many animals and she leaves with her flock. Lune is frightened by the idea that his family may be dead. Eventually there is a fire in the circus and Lune gets all the animals to help put it out. Lune, Jack and, the girl who took care of Lune bid their goodbyes and Lune sneaks onto a boat that will help him get back to Africa.

Dr. Moustache takes Leo and together they escape back down the mountain. It is then that Moustache suddenly realizes that the lion has gone blind.

Leo died on the journey by stabbing himself with Dr. Moustache's knife. He did this so Dr. Moustache could eat his flesh and clothe himself with Leo's fur so he can tell the humans what they need to know. Lune then begins nuzzling his fur. Dr. Moustache tells Lune about what his father did, ""Your father was as wise as he was brave, and you should know what he did to save the world. He was the most courageous soul I've ever met, a true king who gave his life to save the land."" Then both of them head out into a meadow and see clouds in the shape of Leo.  A major story change made for this movie version is that while all the animals communicate with each other, they do not talk to the humans. This change is in direct opposition to Tezuka's stated premise behind his original Jungle Emperor story: that an inter-species society of animals must include humans as well.{{cite web}}

After being turned down at every pawn shop and jeweler he goes to, the jewelers all inform someone of Ham Egg's whereabouts, and soon he is hauled away in a black car by intimidating men in black suits. As it turns out, the stone that he's been trying to sell is really the ""Moonlight Stone"", a mineral that could be used as a power source and save the world from an impending energy crisis. A scientific organization led by Dr. Plus and Dr. Minus seek the help of Ham Egg to lead them to the source of the Moonlight Stone so it can be salvaged and used to help humanity. Ham Egg, however, is only interested in money, but is soon persuaded by Dr. Plus who is well aware of Ham Egg's illegal poaching activities. Ham Egg agrees to work for them, but demands to be put in charge of the search. Accompanying Ham Egg is Mr. Lemonade of the organization, and Dr. Moustache who is already stationed in the jungle. When they arrive in the jungle, Dr. Moustache and Mr. Lemonade are shocked by Ham Egg and his ""friends"" who want only destroy jungle forest land and shoot any animal they come across. Dr. Moustache constantly argues with them over being respectful to nature, as Mr. Lemonade records everything that happens in his journal. As Leo's son, Lune, becomes more and more curious of the human world, Leo continues to protect the animals of the jungle from whatever may threaten them, including Ham Egg's sinister actions, dissent amongst the animals, and a deadly disease that is affecting the animals. With his domain violated by humans in a relentless search for the Moonlight Stone, their actions bring death to the jungle and break up Leo's family. Leaving Leo with the heavy responsibility of bringing peace to the jungle, his family, and even the humans. Lune leaves the jungle behind, and travels by a log in the water to a nearby city. Lune is found by fishers and taken to a circus. A girl from the circus decides to take care of him, and he befriends a rat named Jack. Eventually a bird from the jungle finds Lune and tells him of how the disease is killing off many animals and she leaves with her flock. Lune is frightened by the idea that his family may be dead. Eventually there is a fire in the circus and Lune gets all the animals to help put it out. Lune, Jack and, the girl who took care of Lune bid their goodbyes and Lune sneaks onto a boat that will help him get back to Africa. In the jungle, Lyra is affected by the deadly disease and shortly dies. Although Lukio comes down with the same ailment, Dr. Moustache is able to cure her. We see near the end of the film that she gets better. However, we do not see her in the rest of the film. Leo, heartbroken by the disintegration of his family, decides to lead the humans to the center of the mountain where there are many moonlight stones. Many hunters are lost on the way, but finally they arrive. As they discover the stones, Ham Egg shoots at the trio. At the last minute, Mr. Lemonade jumps in the way and takes the bullet himself and dies. They soon discover the stones, and Ham Egg, blinded by greed, steals one of the stones and swallows it so no one else can have it, but dies shortly afterwards because the stone poisoned him. Dr. Moustache takes Leo and together they escape back down the mountain. It is then that Moustache suddenly realizes that the lion has gone blind. He rids of the stone they got because he believes it has ruined enough lives. The film ends with Lune returning from the human's world and Dr. Moustache taking the cub to see his father's pelt. Leo died on the journey by stabbing himself with Dr. Moustache's knife. He did this so Dr. Moustache could eat his flesh and clothe himself with Leo's fur so he can tell the humans what they need to know. Lune then begins nuzzling his fur. Dr. Moustache tells Lune about what his father did, ""Your father was as wise as he was brave, and you should know what he did to save the world. He was the most courageous soul I've ever met, a true king who gave his life to save the land."" Then both of them head out into a meadow and see clouds in the shape of Leo.  A major story change made for this movie version is that while all the animals communicate with each other, they do not talk to the humans. This change is in direct opposition to Tezuka's stated premise behind his original Jungle Emperor story: that an inter-species society of animals must include humans as well.{{cite web}}

Under the guidance of matron Townsend , an abandoned house is turned into a hospital. Quickly, young pampered 18-year-old Joy socialite Meadows arrives  to assist the other nurses. Initially, she is teased for having no experience, and being of a privileged background. She is welcomed by head nurse Babs Whitney , who becomes the main interest of Lt. Wally O'Brien , whose friend has just recently died in the war. Joy has difficulty adjusting to the violent conditions and starts to miss her easy and innocent life on the Lower East Side in Manhattan after meeting a wounded New York soldier, Robbie Neil . She considers giving up and returning to America, but Mrs. Townsend assures her that life will get easier after she gets used to it. Matters are not improved when a French soldier forces himself up to her. Wally attempts to court Babs, but she is not vulnerable to his advances. They get acquainted, however, after Babs falls of her bicycle and Wally takes care of her minor injuries. Months pass by, and Joy, now a heroic nurse, falls in love with Robbie. She dreams of getting married and having babies, and is certain that Robbie will soon ask her. Babs is more open to letting men in her life as well, and agrees to go out with Wally. The four go to a party, along with Brooklyn-born nurse Rosalie Parker  and Wally's friend Frank Stevens . On their way in Wally's Rolls Royce, Wally and Babs are almost bombed and kiss each other in the heat of the adventure. They quickly leave the party, as it is swamped by drunk men, and return home. Wally attempts to have sex with her, but Babs rejects him and they get into a major fight over their intentions. The next morning, Wally announces to Babs that he will fly to Germany, and they part without romance.

Under the guidance of matron Townsend , an abandoned house is turned into a hospital. Quickly, young pampered 18-year-old Joy socialite Meadows arrives  to assist the other nurses. Initially, she is teased for having no experience, and being of a privileged background. She is welcomed by head nurse Babs Whitney , who becomes the main interest of Lt. Wally O'Brien , whose friend has just recently died in the war. Joy has difficulty adjusting to the violent conditions and starts to miss her easy and innocent life on the Lower East Side in Manhattan after meeting a wounded New York soldier, Robbie Neil . She considers giving up and returning to America, but Mrs. Townsend assures her that life will get easier after she gets used to it. Matters are not improved when a French soldier forces himself up to her. Wally attempts to court Babs, but she is not vulnerable to his advances. They get acquainted, however, after Babs falls of her bicycle and Wally takes care of her minor injuries. Months pass by, and Joy, now a heroic nurse, falls in love with Robbie. She dreams of getting married and having babies, and is certain that Robbie will soon ask her. Babs is more open to letting men in her life as well, and agrees to go out with Wally. The four go to a party, along with Brooklyn-born nurse Rosalie Parker  and Wally's friend Frank Stevens . On their way in Wally's Rolls Royce, Wally and Babs are almost bombed and kiss each other in the heat of the adventure. They quickly leave the party, as it is swamped by drunk men, and return home. Wally attempts to have sex with her, but Babs rejects him and they get into a major fight over their intentions. The next morning, Wally announces to Babs that he will fly to Germany, and they part without romance. Babs, realizing that she loves Wally, is left devastated, unlike Joy, who is enlightened to finally be engaged to Robbie. Shortly after, Joy finds out that Robbie is already married.

Braid developer Jonathan Blow recounts his thought process for the game: how he wished to put his ""deepest flaws and vulnerabilities"" into it and how his initial design experience quickly turned from experimentation to discovery. He also talks about the aftermath of the game: When Braid comes out, it receives widespread critical acclaim, but Blow is disillusioned, when a large portion of players don't ""get"" the underlying message and themes of the game. He makes attempts to influence the audience's impression of the game through forum posts and blog comments, but this eventually turns him into something of a comic figure, something which he feels uncomfortable with. The game, however, remains a commercial and critical success. Super Meat Boy developers Team Meat  set out to do a platform game that harkens back to their own childhood video game experiences. McMillen talks about his lifelong goal of communicating to others through his work. He goes on to talk about his 2008 game Aether that chronicles his childhood feelings of loneliness, nervousness, and fear of abandonment.{{cite web}} He also sheds light on the level design techniques he uses, on how he teaches players to play without extensive tutorials. About a year into development, Microsoft offers Team Meat a chance to take part in an Xbox Live Arcade promotion called ""Game Feast"", under the condition that they finish the game in a month, which they reluctantly accept because of their dire financial situation. The development goes into crunch time, and takes its toll on McMillen's marriage, and on Refenes' health, who bears the brunt of the work. Refenes also laments how he sacrificed his social life to get the game done, but expresses gratitude for his family to be supportive of his goal. The team successfully delivers the game, but come release day, the game is nowhere to be found on Xbox Live, which greatly upsets Refenes, who predicts low sales as a result. The game, however, does eventually appear on the marketplace, and doubles Braid's sales by selling 20000 units on the first 24 hours. McMillen is surprised by both the sales and touched by the fan reaction, and although Refenes, exhausted and cynical, is less enthusiastic, he eventually relents when he first sees videos of people enjoying the game on YouTube. The game eventually goes on to sell a million copies, providing a level of financial security to both developers. FEZ developers Polytron ([[Phil Fish  are in the fourth year of the game's development: the game was first announced at IGF 2008, which thrust Fish into the limelight as an ""indie developer celebrity"", but little was heard of the game since. The development is troubled: The company loses funding, Fish encounters family problems, and his former business partner quits the company, engaging in a legal battle with Fish, which questions the future of the project. Fish himself admits to his perfectionism protracting the development, as well as losing perspective over time about how good the game really is. Similar to Refenes, Fish also notes that he doesn't see himself doing anything else other than indie games, saying that FEZ has become his identity over time. Polytron prepares to present FEZ at Penny Arcade Expo, despite the possibility of the lawsuit lingering. This causes Fish to suffer anxiety attacks over the course of the preparation; without his business partner  signing his side of the final deal, he could potentially block Polytron from presenting at PAX. The FEZ kiosk is set up nevertheless, but the show runs into problems, when last minute changes in the build cause the game to often hang up or crash, forcing Fish to occasionally restart the game. The players, however, are unfazed and continue to enjoy the game nevertheless; Fish gives a number of interviews, and Jerry Holkins expresses his excitement about the product as well. Towards the closing of the show, Fish's new partner Ken Schachter announces that he and the former business partner had a meeting and have come to an agreement, which relieves Fish, who in the end is satisfied with the results of the show, and vows to continue working on the game and releasing it in 2012. The film bookends itself with Jonathan Blow's opening monologue about how indie gaming differs by offering flaws and vulnerabilities, making the games more personal. During the closing credits, videos of other upcoming indie games are interspersed."

Soon after she expresses her wish to marry him, more with the objective of getting rid of Maharshi. When Maharshi comes to know of this, he tries to stop the wedding but is locked up in a police station at the insistence of his own father. However, he assumes that Tilak has used his power as sub-inspector and locked him up. He tries to attack Tilak at their own home but stops when he sees Suchitra open the door. Gradually Maharshi slips into a depression and is hospitalized. Maharshi's pure love for Suchitra is shown when his friend Ramana  drugs Suchitra and brings them to Maharshi's home, assuming that Maharshi wants a physical union with her. Maharshi slaps his friend and explains that he wants her affection and love and not her body, and they carefully take her back.

The idea for the project came from filmmakers Ellen and Jim Hubbard asking themselves ""why can't Congress get a handle on wasteful spending?,"" ""how could we become a part of the process to see how and why Congress makes spending decisions?,"" and “what’s the ultimate ridiculous earmark that we can come up with?’”<ref namePappas|firstTheDC Exclusive: Documentary filmmakers try to get government funding for ‘Museum of Government Waste’|url19 April 2012|newspaper5 March 2012}} Knapp spoke privately with people from members of Congress, to their staff, to lobbyists, in order to get an idea of what goes on outside the public eye.

Unexpectedly stranded on a lonely road to nowhere, it dawns on Klaus that he might be facing his final moments on Earth, and for the first time in his life he starts to question what will be gone – his consciousness. At this, he is mysteriously transformed into a virtual version of himself, a cartoon existing in a virtual version of the world. Things only get stranger for Klaus when he’s rescued by Shahanna, also a cartoon, who is on a similar quest for the deeper knowledge of reality and is guarding a dark secret. Shahanna is accompanied by a guide, Nigel, a large floating brain.

Hushpuppy listens to animal heartbeats and states that all living things have a heartbeat, and they all speak in a language she cannot understand, but she believes they’re just hungry. Hushpuppy rides a makeshift raft with Wink and looks at the factories in the distance that are behind a levee. Hushpuppy, her father, and the inhabitants in the Bathtub, a place beyond the levee, have more holidays where people play various instruments and scream in raucous celebration, although separated from the rest of society. However, a storm is approaching and Hushpuppy thinks that Bathtub will be destroyed but she stays to be joyous as long as she’s with Wink. A local teacher, Miss Bathsheba  lectures several children, including Hushpuppy and points out a tattoo on her thigh that depicts cavemen and beasts called “Aurochs”. The Aurochs are relentless creatures and devour humans but Hushpuppy explains that one day the ice age came and all the Aurochs are frozen now. However, Miss Bathsheba explains that ice caps will melt, and the Bathtub washed away and tells the children they all have to learn how to survive and take care of one another. Hushpuppy returns home and waits for Wink but she arrives late and she makes dinner all by herself. She ponders on the whereabouts of her mother and how she would have a beautiful voice. Wink arrives home dressed in hospital clothing  and yells at her to go home. Angered, Hushpuppy heads home and turns up the stove. As the stove explodes, a fire starts in her home and she hides in a box. Wink comes into Hushpuppy’s home  screaming and trying to find her before their house burns down. Hushpuppy runs out where she is chased by Wink. He catches her and screams at Hushpuppy, but she is defiant and stubborn. Wink slaps her and she falls to the ground. Hushpuppy gets up and curses and punches Wink, to which he falls to the ground. Hushpuppy hears a storm coming. Meanwhile, the scene shifts to that of the Arctic, where a piece of the ice shelf falls into the ocean. Inside the piece that fell off, is an Auroch . Hushpuppy chances upon Miss Bathsheba, who makes some kind of herbal medicine and instructs her to quickly give it to Wink. She returns home and hides the medicine since Wink has left. The next day, many people seem to be preparing to leave, packing their belongings in their trucks, due to the incoming storm. Throughout the film, it is implied that Wink has had alcohol with him and it’s clear that he is an alcoholic. The two head home and divides the house with tape, where Wink tells Hushpuppy not to mind about the storm. Wink, in a effort to make Hushpuppy less worried, attempts to “scare” the storm by shooting at the clouds. The storm has devastated the Bathtub where everywhere is flooded and most of the houses are destroyed. The two sail off in their boat and look for other people. While Wink is searching inside a house, he realizes Hushpuppy is hungry. He then tries to teach her how to catch a fish with her hands, where he tells her to punch the fish’s head really hard, but she looks hesitant. Wink tells Hushpuppy about her mother on how pretty she is and in one incident how she killed an alligator that crept up to him. Luckily, Hushpuppy’s mom came by and shot the alligator. The next day, Wink sails off in search of other children. Hushpuppy states that there are several people that are probably dead and they would hold a Bathtub-style funeral, where no crying is allowed. She also states that the universe is comprised of several tiny pieces and as soon as one of those pieces falls apart, the universe unravels. Hushpuppy is being taught how to crack open a crab with a knife but Wink tells her to stop. Wink then grabs the crab, breaks it with his hands, and eats some of it. He then tells Hushpuppy to “Beast it,""  Eventually the whole group is chanting “Beast it!” where Hushpuppy tears open the crab and gets cheered on by everyone in the bar. The remaining residents form a community by fixing and binding a few houses together. Many wonder if it’s time to leave the area but Miss Bathsheba states that the people on the other side of the levee will just put them in a shelter. They also all realize everything is going to die soon since the area is flooded with salt water. This community continues until one day when Hushpuppy wakes up and sees Wink and two of his friends with a dead alligator and getting ready to sail off. Wink comes over to Hushpuppy and tells her that he’s going to get everything back to normal. Wink and his friends sail off, and we see what their plan is. Wink sticks some dynamite inside the alligator’s mouth and hands the trip wire to one of his friends. They sail up to the levee and plant the alligator bomb at the wall. Unfortunately, Wink’s friend lost the trip wire, and it’s somewhere in the water. While all of this is occurring, Miss Bathsheba wakes up and realizes something is wrong since the three men are gone. She quickly gets in her boat and sails off. Unknown to her though, Hushpuppy snuck into her boat and is hiding under a pile of net. Miss Bathsheba sails up to Wink and his friends and finds the trip wire. She yells at Wink for his plan and throws the trip wire aside. Hushpuppy quickly grabs it and emerges from the net. Everybody freezes as Hushpuppy holds the trip wire. Miss Bathsheba tells her not to do anything but Wink tells her to pull it. Hushpuppy pulls it, and the wall of the levee falls apart. The water drains from the bathtub and everybone goes on with their lives, although the Bathtub is not the same as the way it was before. When Wink is asleep, Hushpuppy notices that he shudders when he is asleep and is obviously sick. She grabs for the medicine she’d hidden and puts it on Wink’s mouth, where he spits the it out. He gets up and breaks the jar containing the medicine. In frustration, Hushpuppy then starts throwing things, as well. In response, Wink begins to throw more things. Then they eventually start to have fun and throw stuff at each other. Later, Wink has to lie down from his sickness where Hushpuppy asks if he is going to die. He states that he isn’t going to die yet, whenever it happens, she would need to fend for herself. She’ll have to be leader and perhaps the last resident of the Bathtub. After letting Hushpuppy win an arm wrestling match, he tells her to be the “man”. The two then fall asleep together as Hushpuppy lays on Wink’s chest, listening to his heartbeat. On the other hand, the Aurochs have started to approach. They are big and strong enough to plow through buildings and Hushpuppy states that they are ruthless enough to eat their own parents when they’re hungry. The next day, however, a number of men have arrived at the Bathtub and tells all the residents that they need to be evacuated in a shelter. While they are being taken care of, a doctor comes up and tells Wink his condition is serious. Wink yells at him and tells the doctor not to say this in front of Hushpuppy. While Wink and the doctor talk farther away, Hushpuppy overheard some of their conversation such as Wink who’s gonna die if he does not get the surgery. After Wink’s surgery, we see him trying to get out of bed, but the doctors won’t let him. They give him some pills and he goes to sleep with Hushpuppy watching. After the doctors leave, Wink spits out the pills and gets out of bed. He tells Hushpuppy that they are leaving. It turns out the residents of the Bathtub have been planning an escape for a while. The residents get out of the shelter and get on a bus while Wink gets left out. Hushpuppy tells then to stop and she runs out to her father where Wink tells her that he is going to die where Hushpuppy cries. Wink admits to her that he’s going to die and that he can’t take care of her anymore. Wink eventually gives in and goes back to the Bathtub with the others while coughing up blood. Meanwhile, Hushpuppy, along with her friends, swim towards the light in the distance where Hushpuppy thinks her mom is but is eventually get picked up by a boat. They eventually arrive on a club and are greeted by several women. Hushpuppy chances upon a woman who thinks is her mom. The woman then leads Hushpuppy to a back room and begins to cook some alligator. Hushpuppy remembers in the past when her mom made her alligator. While the woman is cooking, she tells Hushpuppy that one day she’s going to have to stand up for herself. The woman then hands the alligator dish to Hushpuppy. Hushpuppy tells the woman that she wants to stay with her and bring her, but doesn’t know anything about him, although the woman tells her she is always welcome to stay with. Hushpuppy and the girls arrive back at the Bathtub comes face to face with the Aurochs, who have also arrived, as well. The Aurochs starts chasing them but Hushpuppy remains intact. When one Auroch gets close to her, she turns around and stares at it. Suddenly, all the Aurochs stop. Hushpuppy and the Auroch stare at each other for a while and Hushpuppy remarks that she thinks the Auroch is her “friend”. The Aurochs soon flee making Hushpuppy realize that she has to “take care of her own"". Hushpuppy goes home to see Wink, who is getting worse. She feeds him the alligator dish the woman had given her and remarks that it’s good. The two begin to cry where he tells her not to cry. Hushpuppy cries more as she puts her head on his chest and listen to his last heartbeats as Wink dies. Hushpuppy places Wink’s body in their boat and setting it on fire along with other residents of the Bathtub who are saddened by Wink’s death. Next, Hushpuppy leads a group in the Bathtub, walking down a road. She restates that one day, the future scientists will find evidence of a girl named Hushpuppy that once lived with her father in the Bathtub."

His therapist, Dr. Rosenthal , gives him a writing assignment: to write a page about someone who likes his dog, Scotty. Calvin has a dream in which he meets an attractive young woman, who draws a picture of Scotty and says she likes him. Calvin wakes and is inspired to write about her. In therapy he admits he is falling in love with the character he is writing, and tells the therapist all about Ruby Sparks . Calvin's brother Harry  and sister-in-law Susie  come to visit, and find several articles of women's clothing around the house. The next day, Calvin is stunned to find Ruby in his kitchen, as an actual living person. Thinking he is going crazy, he calls Harry, who does not believe him and advises him to meet with someone else to take his mind off things. Ruby is confused by his behavior and insists on coming along, and leaves her to shop while he meets Mabel , a fan of his book. Ruby finds them, and Calvin discovers that others can actually see Ruby, discovering that she is a real person, not a figment of his imagination. Ruby fights with Calvin, thinking he is cheating on her but he explains how he feels overwhelmed and they make up. Calvin introduces Ruby to Harry, and Harry believes there must a be logical explanation, but Calvin proves that his writing directly affects Ruby. Harry is amazed that Calvin has manifested a woman with his mind, and has the power to change her. Calvin says he loves Ruby and asks Harry not to tell anyone of Ruby's origins. Harry warns him that women are mysterious creatures, and that things may change. Calvin says he wrote her and he knows her, and he will never write about Ruby again. Months later, Calvin reluctantly takes Ruby to meet his free-spirited mother Gertrude  and boyfriend Mort . While Ruby and his family enjoy themselves, Calvin spends the weekend reading by himself, growing jealous of the time Ruby is spending with other people and Ruby's happy spirit begins to dampen at Calvin's increased gloominess. Back at Calvin's house, Calvin complains to that her Ruby singing is disturbing his reading. Upset, she runs upstairs crying. Ruby tells Calvin how lonely she is and suggests they start spending less time together. Calvin is miserable without her and, out of desperation, writes that Ruby is also miserable without him. Ruby returns to Calvin's house full-time, but becomes incredibly clingy toward him, afraid to leave his side for even a second. Calvin tires of this and writes that Ruby is instead ""filled with effervescent joy,"" at which point she becomes constantly happy. After talking with Harry about what he has been doing, Calvin intends to write Ruby back to her normal self but the wording he uses leaves Ruby confused and slightly manic-depressive. Gloomy again, Ruby fights with Calvin once more. He attempts to cheer her up, and takes her along to a party hosted by author Langdon Tharp . At the party, Calvin leaves Ruby and talks with people about his still-unfinished manuscript. He also runs into his ex-girlfriend Lila , and they have a heated argument in which Lila accuses Calvin of only seeing her in an idealized way. Langdon sees Ruby alone and flirts with her, convincing her to strip to her underwear and join him in the pool. Calvin finds Ruby about to join Langdon for a swim and they leave. At home, Calvin and Ruby fight, with Ruby accusing Calvin of controlling of her. As she prepares to leave Calvin, he reveals that she is a product of his imagination, and that he is capable of making her do anything he writes. He demonstrates this to her making her perform various actions. Eventually Calvin stops, his head bent in anguish over his typewriter; while Ruby, exhausted, runs into his bedroom and locks the door. Calvin writes a final page, which states that Ruby is no longer his creation, subject to his will, and she is free. He leaves the manuscript outside, with a note. The next morning, Calvin finds that the note is gone along with Ruby and he breaks down sobbing. Harry, suggests he write a new book about his experiences with Ruby. The novel The Girlfriend  is a success. While walking Scotty in the park Calvin sees Ruby, who has no recollection of him. She is reading his book, which she says her friend described as pretentious. Calvin reveals himself as the book's author, and she asks to start over, and they sit and talk. She asks him not to tell her how the story ends."

Growing up during early 1980s in an upscale part of Belgrade as the only child in a well-off and respected nomenklatura family , he's an exemplary young man in his own right. Studying at the Faculty of Medicine while dating beautiful, smart, and similarly upwardly mobile Maša , the daughter of an influential communist Serbian politician father  and a free-spirited Slovenian mother , Slobodan's an attentive boyfriend and a considerate son. The opening scene has Slobodan listening to Russian bards and chansons on his stereo while respecting his parents' orders as Maša and her parents are coming over for a visit. The two young lovebirds are having a traditional courtship, frequently socializing with the two sets of parents. Even when it comes to the young pair's sexual activity, Slobodan exercises restraint, insisting that the best place for sex is - a married couple's bed; Maša on the other hand is occasionally feeling adventurous, suggesting one night they do it in his yellow Volkswagen, the high school graduation gift from his parents. During the said sexual encounter, which Slobodan agrees to somewhat reluctantly, Maša informs him that on advice from her mother she placed an intrauterine device in her genitalia as a contraceptive. Driving around in his car one morning, Slobodan picks up a female hitchhiker who turns out to be a foreigner. Her name is Clavis and she's a French-speaking Swiss national from Zurich who's visiting Yugoslavia for a tour of Serbian medieval monasteries and frescoes. They hit it off in a playfully flirty conversation and arrange to meet again as he drops her off at Hotel Slavija. Satisfied with the turn of events, Slobodan drives off listening to Paraf's ""Perspektiva"". Another day he takes her to various museums; they discuss art, history, Leni Riefenstahl, Jean-Luc Godard, avant-garde, etc. followed by going up to her hotel room where she fellates him to Azra's ""Iggy Pop"". Out for a day at the Lido beach one afternoon with Maša and both their respective sets of parents, Slobodan has some tough explaining to do because Maša's friend saw him go in the hotel with the Swiss girl. Discovering a hickey on his neck serves as the ultimate proof of his infidelity for Maša and in a fit of anger she hits him on the head with a paddle. He losses consciousness momentarily, but when he comes to, with blood streaming down his face, dazed yet determined, he gets into Danube and swims across. Barefoot and disheveled with wet clothing, he impulsively runs all the way to Hotel Slavija in downtown Belgrade looking for Clavis, but is stopped and thrown out by the hotel security. Slobodan is now determined and ready for a major lifestyle change and marks this by going to the barber to get a haircut and shave off his bushy beard as Pekinška Patka's ""Bolje da nosim kratku kosu"" is playing in the shop. This is just the beginning of Slobodan's extreme behavioural turnaround as the blow to his head seems to have caused a major change inside it. He stops coming home in favour of hanging out and crashing at other people's dorm rooms at Studentski Grad student residence, all of which alarms his parents and Maša who report him missing to the police. Following a fight at the dorm he's reduced to spending the night in sleeping bag on benches at the train station. The police picks him up there, mistaking him for a petty criminal, and the inspector at the station calls his mother who comes to take him home. Once there, more antagonism awaits as his already agitated father completely losses it and gets physical upon seeing aloof Slobodan relieve himself in the bathroom sink with a devil-may-care attitude. Slobodan slaps him back with a stern and sarcastic: ""Don't you ever do that again, daddy"". The father throws him out of the house and on the way out Slobodan takes his own Volkswagen and drives off. His reckless behaviour continues as he shows up to Maša's apartment late one night, but gets informed by her mother that she went to Greece with her father for a holiday. Without missing a beat Slobodan puts the moves on his girlfriend's mother and soon ends up sleeping with her. The mature woman initially somewhat objects, but eventually submits herself gladly to the young man's physical advances. The next morning she makes him breakfast-in-bed, puts on a Bulat Okudzhava record, and initiates the ""this can't continue"" talk in motherly and patronizing tone to which he starts laughing hysterically before calling her a ""menopausal whore whose daughter isn't much better"" and leaving her angry and in tears. As he drives away, he pops in a tape in his car stereo with Šarlo Akrobata's ""Niko kao ja"" and starts masturbating before pulling over as he's about to climax. He soon sells the car in order to buy a motor bike. Slobodan is also getting into the new wave music scene, watching bands at SKC. At the Igra staklenih perli gig, he picks up Ljubica who takes him back to her place where he forces her into giving him fellatio by slapping her face several times as Prljavo kazalište's ""Neka te ništa ne brine"" is blasting on her stereo. After sex she makes a suggestion that he form a band and promises to put him in touch with some people. To that end she takes him to a hipster party - as they enter the private apartment where the party takes place, the live band VIS Idoli are playing ""Schwüle über Europa"" - and introduces him to Pit who likes Slobodan's lyrics."

To win the grand prize of one million German marks, a candidate has to survive seven days on the run while being hunted by the Köhler gang. Of the first 14 candidates, 8 were killed during the course of the game. Bernhard Lotz from Leverkusen is the show's 15th candidate. After almost a week without sleep and little food, he is full of agony and on the verge of physical collapse; Lotz could drop out, but there is the prospect of the grand prize of one million marks, and he knows the fate of one of his predecessors: when he forfeited the game, he was so derided as a coward that he eventually committed suicide. The whole country watches the manhunt on TV, some fascinated, some disgusted. Lotz tries hiding, but he is always recognized. Some want to deliver him to the Köhler gang, but some help him. Throughout the game, the Köhler gang is always hot on his heels. The action is interspersed with scenes from the studio, where the jovial Thilo Uhlenhorst moderates and shows documentation of Lotz's life. Reporters deliver latest developments, interrupted by sexualized commercials by the  ""Stabil-Elite Group"". Behind the scenes, game-makers manipulate the game by helping or harming Lotz. In the grand finale, Lotz has to pass through the ""death spiral"" - a 28.40-meter-long tube of bulletproof glass with three openings through which the Köhler gang can shoot him. Lotz, who is on the verge of collapse and had been treated by doctors shortly before, is slightly wounded but reaches the goal and receives the million. But according to a doctor he is in a serious state of shock, and is taken from the studio to a hospital on a stretcher. Moderator Uhlenhorst declares the 15th edition of the game over and announces the next episode three weeks later."

The house the couple moves into was never finished, so Martin hires a cheap construction crew to complete it. One night, Alice is awakened by hammering in the basement, caused by a carpenter she had not seen with the rest of the crew. Unlike the other workers, this one has a pleasant demeanor and good work ethic, and while Martin is away one night, he stops another carpenter from trying to rape Alice by cutting the man's arms off with a circular saw, sending the dazed Alice back to bed and cleaning up the mess afterward. Alice has a few more run-ins with the carpenter, and comes to the conclusion that he is the spirit of the house's builder, a man named Edward who was executed for killing several repo men when his obsession with perfecting his home caused him to incur massive debt. Despite Ed's murderous past, Alice finds herself falling for his charms, even after witnessing him murder two disgruntled former workers who break into the house to loot it. One day, one of Martin's students, Laura Bell, shows up at the house, to confess to Alice that she and Martin are having an affair, and that she is pregnant with his child. An argument breaks out between Laura and Alice, who kills Laura with a nail gun with help from Ed. When Martin returns home and discovers Laura's mangled body, he attacks Alice, but is subdued and has his head crushed in a vise by Ed. Sometime later, Alice's sister Rachel stops by, and tries to leave with Alice after spotting Martin and Laura's bodies, but she is stopped by Ed, who gets violent with her. Angered by Ed harming her sister, Alice turns against him, and the two fight. During the scuffle, Alice realizes that damaging the house hurts Ed, so she starts a fire with a blow torch. As the flames spread through the house, Alice and a recovered Rachel flee, being briefly chased by Ed before he burns away.

As Jimbo is driving, Cookie gives him a blow job, while Jasmine secretly watches from the backseat. Distracted, Jimbo swerves and hits a utility pole, damaging the car. While looking for help, they find and enter a vacant house, which is actually home to Andre the Butcher, who is not presently there. Jimbo and Kristy decide to go back to the car and wait for help, while Cookie and Jasmine stay behind. Cookie confronts the closeted Jasmine and the two engage in lesbian sex. Meanwhile, escaped convicts Tober and Hoss are seeking refuge. They enter Andre's house and find Cookie and Jasmine having sex. The convicts order them into the living room at gunpoint. While in the living room, Sheriff Cooper comes by and knocks on the door. Hoss orders Jasmine to answer it and get rid of him, threatening to kill Cookie if she doesn't comply. Sheriff Cooper enters the house and informs her of the escaped convicts and asks her if she's seen them. As she tries to quietly tell him that they are in the house, the Sheriff grabs Jasmine and begins to molest her with his baton. Hoss comes out of hiding and kicks the sheriff in the stomach, handcuffs him to the fridge, and leaves him there while they all drive away in his patrol car. Jimbo and Kristy, while waiting by a tree, prepare to make out after Kristy reveals intimate feelings towards him. Andre the Butcher shows up and attacks them. He kills Kristy after luring her away and throws a knife at Jimbo, pinning him to a tree. Jimbo is rescued by Deputy Hollingsworth, who is looking for the escaped convicts, and they both head back to the lodge. As Tober, Hoss, Cookie, and Jasmine are driving away in the Sheriff's car, they encounter Andre on the road, blocking their path. After Tober tries to shoot him, Andre drags him out of the car and kills him. The other three run away and go back to the house. Jimbo also returns with Hollingsworth, who then handcuffs Hoss. Sheriff Cooper, still handcuffed in the kitchen demands she uncuff him, but Jasmine pleas with her not to. Suddenly, the television set turns on, which shows some of their sins: Kristy eats too much and Sheriff Cooper is corrupt. Andre shows up and murders the Sheriff. Hollingsworth shoots at Andre who runs away, but later returns and kills Jimbo and Cookie. While in the basement, Jasmine discovers that Andre is not actually human, but something supernatural. Back in the 1950s, he was an ordinary man, had a wife and daughter and he owned a meat market in town. However, his wife and daughter were both killed in a tragic accident. This enraged Andre and drove him insane. He began to murder his customers and sell their flesh as meat. The townspeople eventually caught on and lynched him. He was buried in a wooden box in a field near his house. His soul was sent to hell, but the devil elected him as his head recruiter on Earth. His duty was to murder sinners, whose souls would be sent to hell. Because he was never given a proper burial, the only way to destroy his demon form on Earth is to bless his grave, which will allow for redemption. Hoss, Jasmine, and Hollingsworth flee the house with two jugs of holy water , to find his grave and bless it. However, Andre pursues them and while running, the jugs break, spilling all the water. He kills Hollingsworth, and stabs both Hoss and Jasmine. Now without any water and seemingly defeated, they both crawl over to his grave, preparing to die together. Having to urinate, Hoss decides to use his own urine in place of water. Too weak to do it himself, he asks Jasmine to pull his penis out and aim for him. He urinates on the grave and blesses the urine, which works as holy water, killing Andre. The movie ends with Hoss and Jasmine apparently surviving, despite still badly wounded.

However, the town had been devastated by the Japanese Recession, and many shops in the town's shopping arcade were forced to close. Over at Tsumishima High School's calligraphy club, a membership crisis ensues after many of its members left the club in quick succession. Satoko refused to be worried, and continues to focus on her work for the upcoming national calligraphy competition. One day, a new relief teacher, Ikezawa, was assigned to the calligraphy club as its adviser. After Satoko and Kana mistook him as a thief, they threw calligraphy ink on him, thus leaving a bad first impression. After hearing that the club only has 7 members left, Ikezawa puts up a performance calligraphy show to attract new members. This enraged Satoko, who strongly believes in the traditional method of calligraphy. However, another member, Kiyomi was deeply impressed by the performance and started practicing it, putting her at odds with Satoko, who later chases her away from the club. Satoko later has a change of heart when she realizes how much calligraphy meant to Kiyomi. She also agreed to put up a performance to commemorate the closure of the shop that Kiyomi's father runs. Ultimately, the performance was a failure, but the club members were surprised at the number of people who came to watch their performance. Just before Kiyomi moved to Hiroshima, she requested Satoko to continue practicing performance calligraphy. At around the same time, Tomoya's grandfather's paper-making workshop burnt down after Tomoya's grandfather started burning the high-quality calligraphy paper he made that no shop wanted to purchase. Satoko got a revelation that all was not lost after she found an unburnt calligraphy paper amidst all the rubble. The calligraphy club then got to work convincing the town's residents to support their idea of starting a performance calligraphy competition and to drum up publicity for the event. The members wanted the competition to revive their dying town. They started practicing very hard, but were frustrated due to the lack of progress. Initially reluctant, Ikezawa finally stepped in to coach them after much persuasion. Even after practicing for a long time, Ikezawa still thinks that their work is still missing something. To overcome this problem, the club members decide to persuade Mio, a former talented club member, back into the club. They eventually succeed and their work gets a big boost. Meanwhile, many schools from around the region have volunteered to participate in the competition. Even the national media have reported about the upcoming competition. To make the competition more meaningful, the members decide only to use the town's famed calligraphy paper, even though those they had were too fragile. Upon seeing their determination, Satoko's father, who was initially opposed to the competition, commissioned Tomoya's grandfather to make a suitably strong calligraphy paper as a sign of his support. On the day of the competition, the team faced strong teams from other high schools. During their performance, they were off to a good start. However, several mishaps occurred and their work was ruined. Despite this setback, the team did not give up and completed their work. After the performance, Ikezawa left the town. In the background, a poster was advertising the next edition of the competition. Ikezawa later opened a letter containing a group photograph of the team and the words ""Thank you"" written behind. Meanwhile, the members of the calligraphy club vowed to not to lose again at the next edition of the competition after receiving a challenge letter from another school."

Taylor is filming their police activities for a film project, attaching small cameras to his and Zavala's uniforms and carrying around a camcorder, much to the dismay of their peers and superiors. After shooting two suspects following a high speed chase, the shooting is declared justified by the D.A. and the officers are commended for their actions. Taylor and Zavala's antics are met with scorn by fellow officer Van Hauser . The officers respond to a call regarding a man, Mr. Tre  scaring off a mailman while intoxicated. Upon arrival, Tre hurls racist insults at the Hispanic Zavala, who responds by accepting a fight, to Taylor's approval. Zavala beats him soundly and arrests him, but wins the man's respect for both fighting fair and not mentioning the fight in the report. Later that night, Tre and his friends are shot at by a group of Latino gang members and one of his friends is killed. The officers find the now-burnt vehicle used in the drive-by the next day, but are shooed off the scene by homicide detectives as well as Van Hauser, who warns them about their cavalier style of police work. Responding to a missing persons report, the officers discover two children bound and locked away in a closet and arrest the distressed mother and her drug-addict husband. Taylor begins dating Janet  and feels Janet is the only girl he's dated who can connect with him on an intellectual level. Zavala, who is married and expecting a child, offers him relationship advice. Investigating the South Central area, Taylor has a hunch and determines to scope out the home of the mother of a known gang member and sees an expensive pick up truck in the driveway. A woman walks out of the house and delivers a large soup saucepan with lid to the man in the truck. As the truck drives away, the officers follow and then, as he fails to stop properly at an intersection, the two pull over a man in a truck, who draws a gun on Zavala as he approaches the driver's window and fires off a round. Zavala deflects the man's arm, and Taylor holds him at gunpoint with his service pistol, forcing him to surrender. After arresting him, the officers find an ornately-decorated, compact .45 Colt automatic pistol, a gold-plated AK-47 rifle, and a large amount of money in his truck . Unbeknownst to them, the money and firearms are connected to a Mexican drug cartel operating in the South Central area, run by ""Big Evil"". Days later, the two officers are first responders at a house fire that has trapped children on the second floor. Zavala and Taylor enter the house and rescue two young children and are nearly overcome by heat and smoke. When the mother informs them that a third child remains inside, Zavala to rushes to the aid of the remaining child as Taylor reluctantly follows, barely making it out alive. The two are commended and receive the Medal of Valor for their actions, but Taylor has mixed emotions about the situation. Using the house fire incident as leverage, Taylor convinces Zavala to further investigate the South Central incident, to Zavala's chagrin. Arriving at the house, Taylor and Zavala notice suspicious behavior from outside and enter. They arrest another man, who is also in possession of several ornate firearms: a .45 Colt automatic similar to the first one found at the traffic stop, and a Walther PPK. Investigating further, Taylor discovers a hidden stash of Mexican and Asian prisoners, indicating that they have just stumbled upon a human trafficking case. Upon exiting the building, they are reprimanded by federal officers of the ICE department, informed that the man had been a person of interest with possible leads to the cartel, and strongly urged to ""lay low"" due to possible cartel reprisals. Taylor is left confused and agitated. Soon after, Zavala's wife Gabby  gives birth to the couple's first child, Mike Zavala Jr. One night, the two receive an 'officer needs help' call from Sook , Van Hauser's probationary partner. She fails to give the address and is unable to communicate their location effectively before she screams and the call is cut off. Urgently responding to the call, the two find Van Hauser calmly waiting in front of a building with a knife stabbed into his right eye, warning the two of a large criminal around the corner. Taylor and Zavala grab a shotgun from their car and investigate, finding the man brutally beating Officer Sook. Instead of using deadly force, Taylor orders the suspect to stop under the threat of force with his shotgun. Surrendering himself for arrest, the suspect is detained by Zavala while Taylor calls for an RA Unit and attends to the rookie officer, whose face has been badly beaten to the point of deformation. Taylor later marries Janet and, after a night of celebration, Zavala drunkenly, thought earnestly, tells Taylor that, should anything happen to him, he will take care of her. After deciding to respond to a more easygoing call the next day, the officers go to investigate a welfare check from an elderly woman. After receiving no response, the officers break down the door and discover a cache of severed corpses, tortured by cartel members. Elsewhere, an unknown observer  records footage of a cartel member speaking on the phone to put a kill order on the officers, and the LA gangsters lead by ""Big Evil"" from the earlier drive-by begin plotting their assassination. While Taylor and Zavala receive no warning from the LAPD or the federal agency that recorded the conversation, Tre, having a higher level of respect for Zavala after the earlier fight, warns them of rumors that they are now hot targets for the cartel, but they disregard his comments, saying ""We're cops, everyone wants to kill us."" Janet becomes pregnant shortly after the marriage. After a short pursuit with a reckless minivan one night, the officers chase the driver into an apartment complex, where the gangsters have set up an ambush to kill them. The officers are fired upon with AK-47 assault rifles and Officer Taylor is shot in the hand, destroying his radio. Taking refuge in a small apartment, Taylor decides that they are going to have to gun their way out. The two open fire, supressing the gunmen, and end up killing a shooter on the way out of the complex. Awaiting backup outside, the two are fired upon once more and Taylor is shot in the chest. Zavala kills the shooter, desperately attends to Taylor, and cries out for backup, but Taylor remains unresponsive. Zavala begins to believe Taylor is dying and cries in mourning, while frantically calling for backup. Realizing that the gangsters from inside the apartment have approached behind him, Zavala reaches for his firearm, but is repeatedly shot in the back. As a last-ditch effort to save his partner, he throws his body over the seriously wounded Taylor, protecting him from further injury, at the cost of his own life. Backup eventually arrives and a brief shootout ensues. The gangsters, including ""Big Evil"", are shot and killed when they refuse to drop their weapons and spray shots at the backup officers. Zavala is killed in his effort to save Taylor, but it is revealed that Taylor miraculously survived the encounter, albeit heavily injured. A funeral is held for Officer Zavala, during which Taylor tearfully declares that Zavala was his brother, before breaking down in tears among his wife and Zavala's family. The screen fades to black. In an epilogue scene, a clip is shown from earlier in the day of the shooting, during which Zavala details hiding under his then-newlywed wife's parents' bed while the parents had sex. Taylor and Zavala both laugh heartily, before going off to ""fight crime or some shit""."

Investigating the South Central area, Taylor has a hunch and determines to scope out the home of the mother of a known gang member and sees an expensive pick up truck in the driveway. A woman walks out of the house and delivers a large soup saucepan with lid to the man in the truck. As the truck drives away, the officers follow and then, as he fails to stop properly at an intersection, the two pull over a man in a truck, who draws a gun on Zavala as he approaches the driver's window and fires off a round. Zavala deflects the man's arm, and Taylor holds him at gunpoint with his service pistol, forcing him to surrender. After arresting him, the officers find an ornately-decorated, compact .45 Colt automatic pistol, a gold-plated AK-47 rifle, and a large amount of money in his truck . Unbeknownst to them, the money and firearms are connected to a Mexican drug cartel operating in the South Central area, run by ""Big Evil"". Days later, the two officers are first responders at a house fire that has trapped children on the second floor. Zavala and Taylor enter the house and rescue two young children and are nearly overcome by heat and smoke. When the mother informs them that a third child remains inside, Zavala to rushes to the aid of the remaining child as Taylor reluctantly follows, barely making it out alive. The two are commended and receive the Medal of Valor for their actions, but Taylor has mixed emotions about the situation. Using the house fire incident as leverage, Taylor convinces Zavala to further investigate the South Central incident, to Zavala's chagrin. Arriving at the house, Taylor and Zavala notice suspicious behavior from outside and enter. They arrest another man, who is also in possession of several ornate firearms: a .45 Colt automatic similar to the first one found at the traffic stop, and a Walther PPK. Investigating further, Taylor discovers a hidden stash of Mexican and Asian prisoners, indicating that they have just stumbled upon a human trafficking case. Upon exiting the building, they are reprimanded by federal officers of the ICE department, informed that the man had been a person of interest with possible leads to the cartel, and strongly urged to ""lay low"" due to possible cartel reprisals. Taylor is left confused and agitated. Soon after, Zavala's wife Gabby  gives birth to the couple's first child, Mike Zavala Jr. One night, the two receive an 'officer needs help' call from Sook , Van Hauser's probationary partner. She fails to give the address and is unable to communicate their location effectively before she screams and the call is cut off. Urgently responding to the call, the two find Van Hauser calmly waiting in front of a building with a knife stabbed into his right eye, warning the two of a large criminal around the corner. Taylor and Zavala grab a shotgun from their car and investigate, finding the man brutally beating Officer Sook. Instead of using deadly force, Taylor orders the suspect to stop under the threat of force with his shotgun. Surrendering himself for arrest, the suspect is detained by Zavala while Taylor calls for an RA Unit and attends to the rookie officer, whose face has been badly beaten to the point of deformation. Taylor later marries Janet and, after a night of celebration, Zavala drunkenly, thought earnestly, tells Taylor that, should anything happen to him, he will take care of her. After deciding to respond to a more easygoing call the next day, the officers go to investigate a welfare check from an elderly woman. After receiving no response, the officers break down the door and discover a cache of severed corpses, tortured by cartel members. Elsewhere, an unknown observer  records footage of a cartel member speaking on the phone to put a kill order on the officers, and the LA gangsters lead by ""Big Evil"" from the earlier drive-by begin plotting their assassination. While Taylor and Zavala receive no warning from the LAPD or the federal agency that recorded the conversation, Tre, having a higher level of respect for Zavala after the earlier fight, warns them of rumors that they are now hot targets for the cartel, but they disregard his comments, saying ""We're cops, everyone wants to kill us."" Janet becomes pregnant shortly after the marriage. After a short pursuit with a reckless minivan one night, the officers chase the driver into an apartment complex, where the gangsters have set up an ambush to kill them. The officers are fired upon with AK-47 assault rifles and Officer Taylor is shot in the hand, destroying his radio. Taking refuge in a small apartment, Taylor decides that they are going to have to gun their way out. The two open fire, supressing the gunmen, and end up killing a shooter on the way out of the complex. Awaiting backup outside, the two are fired upon once more and Taylor is shot in the chest. Zavala kills the shooter, desperately attends to Taylor, and cries out for backup, but Taylor remains unresponsive. Zavala begins to believe Taylor is dying and cries in mourning, while frantically calling for backup. Realizing that the gangsters from inside the apartment have approached behind him, Zavala reaches for his firearm, but is repeatedly shot in the back. As a last-ditch effort to save his partner, he throws his body over the seriously wounded Taylor, protecting him from further injury, at the cost of his own life. Backup eventually arrives and a brief shootout ensues. The gangsters, including ""Big Evil"", are shot and killed when they refuse to drop their weapons and spray shots at the backup officers. Zavala is killed in his effort to save Taylor, but it is revealed that Taylor miraculously survived the encounter, albeit heavily injured. A funeral is held for Officer Zavala, during which Taylor tearfully declares that Zavala was his brother, before breaking down in tears among his wife and Zavala's family. The screen fades to black. In an epilogue scene, a clip is shown from earlier in the day of the shooting, during which Zavala details hiding under his then-newlywed wife's parents' bed while the parents had sex. Taylor and Zavala both laugh heartily, before going off to ""fight crime or some shit""."

The start of Pietri's sporting career was a hard one. A passionate long-distance runner, like his brother Ulpiano, Dorando Pietri was rebuffed by trainer Barbisio because he was deemed to be too meager. Still, Pietri takes part to the marathon race at Carpi, his home town, and finishes first, ahead of Pericle Rondinella, the star runner of Barbisio's team. The day later though Rondinella was to beat Pietri in another race. Ottavio, an old but experienced trainer, was following both races and, recognizing Pietri's potential, he hires him to train for the Italian championships. Thanks to Ottavio's guidance Pietri soon becomes Italian champion and is selected to represent his country at the marathon event during the Games of the IV Olympiad, in 1908. On the D-day, Pietri runs a perfect marathon and is far ahead of his followers. But as he enters the London stadium to run the few remaining yards he is distracted and takes the wrong turn, gets disoriented, staggers and falls, gets up and falls again. The crowd cheers to encourage him standing up, and the referees too encourage him wholeheartedly. Pietri seems just exhausted. But as he sees his competitor, the American Johnny Hayes, entering the stadium, he gathers his very last forces, stands up, runs and collapses right after passing the finish line.Document published by Rai TV  The spectators and family who are following the scene are split in mixed feelings between joy and concerns for Pietri's condition. Will he survive, or was it too much? And then the good news comes: Pietri is safe and sound. But his hour of glory is short. The Americans lodge a complaint arguing that Pietri was supported to stand up. The victory is then assigned to Hayes. Moved by this misfortune, and to express the British people's admiration for him, Queen Alexandra presents to Pietri a cup filled with pounds exactly identical to the one presented to the winner. But can that really be a substitute for a denied victory?

Upon his arrival, Tex finds Lydia working as a secretary for a couple of fast-talking producers rather than being the stage star that her home town thinks she has become. Tex is just the angel for whom sharpshooter producers Mac McClure and Marty Allen have been waiting, because they have a play set for rehearsal but no money to produce it, and their leading lady, Valerie Blayne, is adding to their problems by threatening reprisals from her gangster boyfriend, Pooch Davis, unless the show opens on schedule. Tex agrees to invest his money in the show if Lydia is given the lead, and when Mac and Marty consent to his terms, the play goes into rehearsal as a drama with two leading ladies. When Valerie threatens Mac with bodily harm unless she plays the lead, Mac informs Tex that he is going to fire Lydia unless he buys the entire show. Sensing that the play would work as a farce, Marty's wife Marge puts up the money on the condition that Tex play the male lead. True to Marge's instincts, on opening night, the play has the audience rolling in the aisles as dynamite planted on stage by Valerie's vindictive boyfriend explodes, and the actors' performances are so bad that they are funny. As a comedy, the show becomes a smash success, but when a plagiarism suit looms on the horizon, Tex and Marge sell the show back to its eager producers and leave them holding the bag."

Fitz  is a man in his mid-to-late-twenties who, after the fall of his band  three years prior, has resorted to selling marijuana. He is dating a woman named Monica , who was a fan of his band back in the day. During the day, aside from selling marijuana, Fitz spend his time with 16-year-old Jimmy , a neighborhood kid who ditches school to hang with Fitz. After one of Fitz's clients is caught with weed, Fitz decides to leave Los Angeles, California temporarily for Oakland, California to avoid being arrested. Meanwhile, Jimmy is threatened to be sent to military school by his father  for skipping and failing classes, Jimmy convinces Fitz to take him to Oakland with him to visit his mother, who supposedly lives there. Jimmy's father finds a friend in the police force and they take off in search for Jimmy, believing that he had been kidnapped. Along the way, Jimmy attempts to keep Fitz sober along the trip . Jimmy suggests they switch out vehicles so that it would be harder to track down the pair. Fitz agrees and suggests that they trade vehicles with his ex-band mates , who have since become a tribute band in Bakersfield, California. Meanwhile, Jimmy's father and his friend continue to track down Jimmy and Fitz, while the idea is placed in their heads that it is possible that Jimmy is being raped because he is ""an attractive young man."" They track down Fitz's vehicle  and convince them to tell them where Fitz and Jimmy are headed, but the band mates misinform them on what vehicle they are driving. Also, Monica has a small affair with her boss  and finds out that she is pregnant with Fitz's child. Fitz discovers the affair after Monica calls him and tells him. Not knowing exactly what happened to Fitz, Monica follows Fitz's trail and finds the old band mates as well, who inform her that he is headed to Oakland to reconnect with his estranged father. Angered that Fitz never told her this, Monica continues to head off to find Fitz. Meanwhile, Fitz and Jimmy stop at an old diner and Fitz argues about his sexuality with a prostitute. Jimmy also reluctantly declines a blow job and a hand job from the prostitute. Fitz and Jimmy decide to stop for food and so that Fitz could relieve himself. While Jimmy is waiting in the car, he notices his father and his friend pulling up in their car in hot pursuit of Fitz and Jimmy. When the pair go inside, Jimmy slashes their tires.

Once they have talked it out, they turn to realize that their vehicle is being towed. While chasing after the tow truck, Jimmy trips and breaks his hand, causing the guys to fake their names and go to the doctor. The doctor  insinuates that he believes Fitz has kidnapped and is molesting Jimmy because Jimmy is attractive. However, once Jimmy has a cast and sling on, the two run from the doctor's office. Meanwhile, Jimmy's father and his friend track down the towed van and they get a tip to meet at a bar called ""Berlin"", where Fitz and Jimmy will supposedly be later. They also have a growing concern for Jimmy's safety and fear of his ""virginity being at stake"" after finding his clothes in a bag in the back of the van along with scratch marks on the sides of the van.

Uncle Da's troupe does traditional performance in front of religious processions. The religion requires performers to ""initiate the faces and pose as gods""—to put on a special face painting, or to put on a heavy body puppet costume, both of these represent gods' persona. The performance demands training of martial arts, acrobatics and endurance, and the society associates performers with gangsters. Uncle Da has been competing with Wu-cheng , who studied with Uncle Da under the same master. A-Tai grew estranged with his father and the troupe, and went to Taipei to study Rock music, until a mysterious old man in a blue coat bids him home. A-Tai's home is a small private temple which also accommodates Uncle Da's troupe, now named Jyou-tian. The troupe is composed of young men and one young woman Min-min : Pear is autistic, A-Hsin is abused by his father, and Min-min, A-Kui and Maria came to Uncle Da's strict discipline to avoid becoming gangsters. Uncle Da is aided by middle-aged Betel-nut Cheng. Betel-nut Cheng is married with a Mainlander immigrant wife, and may have to quit the troupe to concentrate on his betel-nut stand. At home A-Tai quarrels with Uncle Da and his troupe. They call A-Tai ""Three Minutes"" because he cannot commit himself long enough. Meanwhile, Jyou-tian is pushed out of business by Wu-cheng's troupe. With support of Aunt Da, A-Tai challenges Wu-cheng and his son A-Hsien : A-Tai takes charge of Jyou-tian, and A-Tai promises that under his leadership, Jyou-tian will defeat Wu-cheng's troupe in six months, or Jyou-tian will leave Taichung altogether. As he takes charge, A-Tai learns the art of the troupe and the difficulties of each troupe member. A-Tai starts training with drumming, and tries to use stage elements and create a new performance that ""earns respect without initiating the face and posing as gods."" Uncle Da is against A-Tai's idea, and all crew members are loyal to Uncle Da. A-Tai insists on his authority, and takes the troupe on a tour to circle the Taiwan island on foot. Outside the troupe, A-Tai is also challenged by A-Hsien, who performs the challenging sequence of ""Settling Camp"" before him. On their island tour, Jyou-tian performed drumming before a temple. A-Tai's style is accepted by the crowd and other troupes, and A-Tai earns the hearts of all the troupe members. The tour also attracts coverage of TV show host Bi  and becomes famous. A-Hsien, though antagonistic to A-Tai, admires A-Tai's will to take over his father's place. Both Bi and Min-min develop romantic interest in A-Tai, but A-Tai only sees Min-min and Bi gives up. After Jyou-tian comes back to Taichung, they win the promised contest with Wu-cheng's group. A-Hsien joins A-Tai, and the two young men want to join the two troupes to perform on the ""International Cultural Festival"" hosted by the Taichung government. However their fathers reject the plan. The man in blue coat shows up and is revealed to be the master of Uncle Da and Wu-cheng. He beats the two disciples and lectures them. Later in the temple, the two fathers reconcile each other and their sons and the two troupes join hands for the Festival. On the Festival night, Jyou-tian performed on a stage in the amphitheater of an urban park. Jyou-tian's new performance modifies the face painting and costumes, and is combined with stage props, effects, performers' vocals and electric guitars. They win the respect of their families, the master, and all other audiences. A-Tai's narration concludes that his way now earns Uncle Da's support, and Jyou-tian undergoes an even more difficult training including climbing Mount Yu and passing Sahara desert, Africa."

The troupe is composed of young men and one young woman Min-min : Pear is autistic, A-Hsin is abused by his father, and Min-min, A-Kui and Maria came to Uncle Da's strict discipline to avoid becoming gangsters. Uncle Da is aided by middle-aged Betel-nut Cheng. Betel-nut Cheng is married with a Mainlander immigrant wife, and may have to quit the troupe to concentrate on his betel-nut stand. At home A-Tai quarrels with Uncle Da and his troupe. They call A-Tai ""Three Minutes"" because he cannot commit himself long enough. Meanwhile, Jyou-tian is pushed out of business by Wu-cheng's troupe. With support of Aunt Da, A-Tai challenges Wu-cheng and his son A-Hsien : A-Tai takes charge of Jyou-tian, and A-Tai promises that under his leadership, Jyou-tian will defeat Wu-cheng's troupe in six months, or Jyou-tian will leave Taichung altogether. As he takes charge, A-Tai learns the art of the troupe and the difficulties of each troupe member. A-Tai starts training with drumming, and tries to use stage elements and create a new performance that ""earns respect without initiating the face and posing as gods."" Uncle Da is against A-Tai's idea, and all crew members are loyal to Uncle Da. A-Tai insists on his authority, and takes the troupe on a tour to circle the Taiwan island on foot. Outside the troupe, A-Tai is also challenged by A-Hsien, who performs the challenging sequence of ""Settling Camp"" before him. On their island tour, Jyou-tian performed drumming before a temple. A-Tai's style is accepted by the crowd and other troupes, and A-Tai earns the hearts of all the troupe members. The tour also attracts coverage of TV show host Bi  and becomes famous. A-Hsien, though antagonistic to A-Tai, admires A-Tai's will to take over his father's place. Both Bi and Min-min develop romantic interest in A-Tai, but A-Tai only sees Min-min and Bi gives up. After Jyou-tian comes back to Taichung, they win the promised contest with Wu-cheng's group. A-Hsien joins A-Tai, and the two young men want to join the two troupes to perform on the ""International Cultural Festival"" hosted by the Taichung government. However their fathers reject the plan. The man in blue coat shows up and is revealed to be the master of Uncle Da and Wu-cheng. He beats the two disciples and lectures them. Later in the temple, the two fathers reconcile each other and their sons and the two troupes join hands for the Festival. On the Festival night, Jyou-tian performed on a stage in the amphitheater of an urban park. Jyou-tian's new performance modifies the face painting and costumes, and is combined with stage props, effects, performers' vocals and electric guitars. They win the respect of their families, the master, and all other audiences. A-Tai's narration concludes that his way now earns Uncle Da's support, and Jyou-tian undergoes an even more difficult training including climbing Mount Yu and passing Sahara desert, Africa."

John can't seem to find work at any airport because they're looking for jets. He then finds out he and Mary are going to have a kid, so needing to find work, he heads off to reenlist in the Air Force, but finds even they won't take him back in, as they're looking for jets as well, which further angers him. Finally Junior arrives and John is very pleased...until he realizes he's a jet also, making him lose his mind . When reading the paper the next day, John sees the ad for a jet contest held by the United States Government where the winner gets a huge contract. Plenty fed up with jets, he goes to enter the contest as well to try to show them up. Realizing what risk he's putting himself in, Mary goes after him with Junior in tow. En route to the contest, John meets a B-29 general who smokes Douglas MacArthur's trademark corncob pipe and has Bataan written amidst his five stars. When John asks him, the general declines to enter the contest and states, parodying MacArthur's farewell address to the U.S. Congress, that ""older planes never fly, they just fade away,"" before literally fading away. At the contest, John lines up at the starting line with the rest of the jets. Mary catches up and tries in vain to reason with him, but gets shoved away by him. While this was happening, Junior gets out of the baby buggy and get in the fuselage of John, and by the time Mary realizes it it's too late. At the green flag, the jets all but disappear while John sputters badly to take off and run the race. Within no time, his propellers had had enough and detach from his body, sending him into a nose dive for Earth. Junior realizes what's happening and manages to get out in time to grab him by the tail and save him. When John realized he hadn't crashed, he looks back and sees Junior holding his tail and flying him along. After happily praising him for saving him, they then kick it into high gear and run the race, tearing past the other contestants, and are shown flying around the world, going by certain landmarks with funny things happening.  They easily win the race and the government contract...for Junior. John's joy is soon sort of crushed when he is told they need ten-thousand more just like him, realizing he and Mary have some procreating to do."

The performance goes badly, and Alex is kicked out of the partnership on account of his depressing lyrics. The next day, Alex arrives late at work much to the scrutiny of his boss and co-worker. He tries to leave early to go to a gig, although his boss refuses to let him go, and his co-worker taunts him about it. This prompts Alex to assault him and he is fired immediately afterwards. Now out of work, Alex goes to his gig, which is at a school and involves him playing guitar for a group of mentally handicapped adults while dressed in a pink moose outfit. The gig goes well at first with the group getting up to dance while he plays, although one of them latter attacks him with a fake knife, prompting Alex to punch him. He is kicked out of the school, and wanders into a park where he meets a man named Jim  who recognizes him from the failed performance the night before. After initially trying to chase him off, Jim knocks Alex unconscious and drags him back home where he proposes his idea of starting a band together, since he too was recently kicked out of a band. Alex, upset about being knocked out and abducted, chases Jim out of his apartment and later gets a call from his older brother Brian  Brian suggests that Alex stay at his place for a while to get his life back together, and Alex initially agrees, although later changes his mind and returns to Jim, agreeing to travel with him.

Shortly before the gig, the manager confronts Jim about Weilands absence and Jim tells him that Weiland on a bender, and can't make the show. He convinces the manager that the story is true, and lies well enough to bring him to tears. The band doesn't get to perform but sells most of their merch and Cassidy steals a bottle of wine. After Jim falls asleep, Alex and Cassidy share the bottle and chat, although Alex becomes agitated when Cassidy reveals that she read the letter he writes to himself . The band continues its travels, eventually taking a gig in an unusual frat house.

He is given a pendant that would shine on coming in contact with the savior-to-be. Bheem and his friends from Dholakpur are in a tussle with Kichak and his friends from Pehelwanpur, over who is the better team, when they hear noises. On investigating, they find that a young monk is attacked by robbers who try to rob the monk, of the pendant. Bheem springs into action and fights off the robbers. When he takes hold of the pendant to return it to its owner, it starts glowing, thus giving the indication that he is the savior. The monk introduces himself as Ming, and explains the purpose of his visit. It is portrayed that Shaolin temple has been living undisturbed in peace for centuries, until it was attacked and defeated by Kaifu and his army. Kaifu laid out the condition that each year, for the next ten years, he would face a member represented by Shaolin, and they would fight till one man is left standing. If Kaifu wins on all ten occasions, he would take control over Shaolin temple. For the last nine years, the representatives of Shaolin have been defeated by Kaifu without dropping a sweat. The representative of Shaolin temple the previous year was Chang, who had mastered all the five techniques of Shaolin, but was defeated by Kaifu within 3 minutes. With king Induverma's permission, Bheem, Raju, Chutki, Jaggu and Indumati set off for Shaolin, and they are joined by Kalia, Dholu, Bholu, Kichak and Mannu. They start their training immediately, under the guidance of Ming. On reaching Shaolin temple, each of them is given a signature technique. Bheem and Kalia learn Lion's technique, Chutki is taught Snake technique, Raju learns Monkey technique, Kichak learns Crane's technique, and Mannu learns Mentis technique. Within a few days they show great progress. However, Bheem feels that is not enough to defeat Kaifu, so his friends teach him their signature techniques. Shortly thereafter, he is even able to overpower Chang, someone who has been practicing for years. The head monk announces the squad that would face Kaifu's team, but leaves Bheem out as he broke a shaolin rule. He and his friends are taken to a river by Ming, where they end up confronting the soldiers of Kaifu, but they are vastly outnumbered. A mysterious figure arrives on the scene and drops a smoke bomb to help Bheem and his friends escape. At his place, Ming introduces him as Laoshi, formerly the best Shaolin student, but was also banished from the temple because of his lack of faith in Shaolin techniques. With Laoshi, they begin strategising on how to defeat Kaifu. Bheem spies on Kaifu's soldiers while they are practicing, and learns Kaifu's signature technique- the Eagle's fist. He is told by Laoshi not to use the technique in Shaolin temple or on his friends as it is very lethal. Bheem continues practicing and soon reaches the peak of his training. Tragedy strikes the day before the tournament, as Kalia is caught while trying to spy on Kaifu. He is about to be imprisoned, when Ming arrives just in time to convince the guards into arresting him instead. Kalia narrates the whole incident to Bheem and his friends who are shocked on hearing about it. Its the day of the battle; Raju, Kalia, Chutki, Kichak, Mannu and Chang arrive to square off against Kaifu and his team. Bheem and Laoshi invade Kaifu's camp and rescue Ming. Laoshi continues to fight while Bheem is sent back to save Shaolin temple. By the time Kaifu's turn arrives, three members of Shaolin team are already defeated, and Chang is injured. However, since Chang is evidently the strongest member among the present team, the head monk instructs him to go ahead and face Kaifu. But Bheem arrives just in time and challenges Kaifu to fight. Bheem challenges Kaifu to accept his condition that if he wins, Kaifu will have to leave Shaolin temple alone forever. Kaifu in turn places forth his own condition that if Kaifu wins, Bheem will have to become his slave for life. Bheem agrees, and the battle commences. Its the clash of the titans, and both of them push each other to the limit. Bheem remembers Laoshi's advice that he needs a special technique to beat Kaifu, and that Nature is the best teacher. He is able to develop a very powerful signature attack and uses it to defeat Kaifu once and for all. Kaifu begs forgiveness to the head monk. The head monk congratulates Bheem on saving Shaolin temple. Bheem in return requests the head monk to reinstate Laoshi into the Shaolin temple, to which the head monk replies that there is no barrier on Laoshi and he can return whenever he wants. There is celebration all around on Shaolin's victory, and Chutki asks Bheem how was he able to form a signature attack in the middle of a fight. Bheem jokingly replies that first they will have to eat a lot of ladoos, and everyone breaks into laughter. The film ends with a 'Happy New Year' greeting on the screen.Critics' Take

The film is set when Raja, a young man of twenty-five years, reintegrates into society. The film's main character is determined to secure employment inside a large mansion, a mysterious aspiration that becomes clear as the narrative progresses. Raja proceeds to impress the owner of the residence, Mihir Das , as well as his wife, Tulasi . He is subsequently employed as the couple's driver, having gradually won the pair over. Due to circumstance, Raja is compelled to inform Tulasi about his commitment to his dead mother and, from that point forward, Raja perceives Tulasi as a maternal figure. The film then becomes increasingly suspenseful, as a photo of Raja's mother is revealed and the audience is shown that Tulasi appears identical to the deceased woman. The narrative also explores the concept of the ""good"" boy or man. Mihir Das is a character with a respectable status in terms of social perception, possessing wealth and fame.

She disappears after he draws the curtain, but as a former magician's assistant, uses the opportunity to escape. Police Inspector Farraday ([[Richard Lane  takes Blackie into custody as an accomplice, but Blackie easily gets away himself. A trip to the library reveals that Dinah was set to prison for three years a robbery that netted $100,000  and a dead victim. Her magician former husband, John Lampau, was acquitted. Blackie tracks Lampau down, still performing magic, but now under the name of Jani, to warn him. Dinah shows up minutes later, having heard that Jani intends to marry his new assistant, Irene . Dinah has come to make sure she gets her half of the loot. In a scuffle, she grazes Jani's right hand with a gunshot before fleeing. Blackie arranges to impersonate Jani, while the magician hides in Blackie's absent friend's apartment. That night, Blackie is awoken by sounds in Jani's apartment.

Upon learning that Maria is pregnant with their third child, Cross considers accepting a job as an FBI profiler, but fears Maria's reaction, as it'd require them to relocate to Washington, D.C. Meanwhile, a man called Picasso  attends to an illegal underground Mixed Martial Arts fighting ring, where he flirts with businesswoman Fan Yau . After brutally beating his opponent, Picasso is invited to Fan Yau's house, where he sedates her while they're having sex, tortures and kills her. Police Captain Richard Brookwell  calls Cross and his partner, Tommy Kane , to the crime scene. On the way there, Cross tells Kane about Maria's pregnancy and the the FBI's offer, and Kane reveals that he is secretly dating their colleague, Monica Ashe . Cross deduces that Picasso is a professional assassin, and finds a sketch made behind by Picasso, revealing that his next target is businessman Erich Nunemarcher . Cross, Kane and Ashe go to Nunemarcher's office, but Nunemarcher ignores their claims. Picasso manages to enter the building, but is prevented from killing Nunemarcher by Cross, and escapes after being shot by Kane. Cross analyzes a drop of Picasso's blood and learns that he is a psychotic former member of the Special Forces and that his real target is billionaire CEO Leon Mercier . Cross informs Mercier that Picasso might be trying to kill him. Meanwhile, as revenge for their earlier interferance, Picasso attacks Ashe, sedating and beating her; and kills Maria with a sniper shot, leading both Cross and Kane to swear revenge against him. Cross and Kane learn that Picasso is targeting Mercier at a conference and informs Brookwell, who isolates the area. However, Picasso is able to kill Mercier by firing a bazooka from a moving train. Cross and Kane chase after Picasso and corner him at an abandoned theater, where Picasso and Cross fight and the fight ends with Picasso falling to his death. Cross eventually learns that Picasso's employer was Mercier himself. Having emblezzed money from his clients, Mercier asked for Yau and Nunemarcher's help to fake his death and flee to Bali, and then hired Picasso to eliminate Yau, Nunemarcher and a double pretending to be the real Mercier. However, Cross is able to plant drugs in Mercier's belongings before he leaves and informs the local police. Mercier is arrested in Singapore and condemned to death by firing squad. Having captured Maria's murderer, Cross decides to accept the FBI's offer and move to Washington with his family. Before he leaves, Kane reveals that he also applied for a job in the FBI, hoping that they'll work together again one day, and they part ways.

After being active for four months, Murder was shut down by the authorities and all its content confiscated, though the host, a man simply known as Balan, evaded capture and identification. Now, years later, Balan has reemerged to show off more footage he has collected, and offer commentary on people's obsession with death, the effect it has on them, and how accessible new media has made it. The series of videos is kicked off by Balan stating, ""I ask you all... Why are you watching? Are you trying to find reality? Do you feel the need to be shocked? To witness something that human eyes shouldn't see? Murder is reality. Death comes when you least expect it. With what you are about to observe, you may question your own integrity. You will ask, could this happen to me? My answer to you is... Yes it can."" * Bludgeoning: A drunk Russian man unintentionally beats his teenage son to death in front of the son's running webcam. * The Heist: A restaurant is robbed by a quartet of gunmen, who shoot a cashier in the head and a fleeing customer in the back, all of it caught by the security system. * The Cheat: In front of a stationary camera, a man reminisces about how he met his wife, and about all the good times they shared, while a monitor in the background shows his wife having sex with someone else. The man leaves the room, and the monitor shows him barging in on his wife and her lover, hacking the former to death with an axe, and cutting out her heart, which the wife had once said would always belong to him. * S&G: A parking lot security camera catches two people attacking a couple, beating the man with a baseball bat, and abducting the woman. * Broadway Rob: The distorted home movie of a pedophile who forces his latest victims, two gagged boys clad only in their socks and underwear, to dance with him. One of the boys manages to overpower the pedophile, strangling him with his bonds, and stabbing him over and over again with a knife. * Execution: A muffled black and white camcorder video of a hooded and masked group  executing a man via decapitation in front of a woman, who they taunt with the severed head before shooting her. * ATM: A man is mugged and killed at an ATM. * Autopsy: Japanese autopsy footage of a woman who was shot in the mouth, the bullet exiting the top of her skull. The coroner eventually grows annoyed by the antics of the cameraman, and kicks him out of the room. * Bullied: A trio of drunks use a camcorder to record themselves taking a man out to the woods, under the pretense of initiating him into their group. The three bully and humiliate the man, and during a scuffle, one of them accidentally knocks him onto the knife another was holding. The three panic and bicker, and the camera is dropped when a violent fight breaks out over whether they should go to the police. * Homecoming: A building security camera records two figures garroting a man. * Ransom: A severely deteriorated series of ransom videos show three men torturing a woman while making their demands. Much to the annoyance of her captors, the woman eventually dies due to the severity of her injuries. After the last clip, Balan delivers the closing statement, ""You realize now it's everywhere.

Unbeknownst to him, he ends up getting a bird loving dog. While out hunting, he tells the dog to get him ""something to shoot at"", so it sets up some cans along the fence for him. But when Barney tells him to hunt for birds with him, the dog refuses, showing off his Bird Lovers card. The dog then runs out into the woods to save a baby quail while Barney tries hunting for it. The dog tries to trick Barney by pulling off a disappearing magic trick, but is busted and the bird escapes. Barney tries to shoot it but the dog pulls an entire blade of grass out from under Barney like a mat, tripping him. Barney chases the bird and hides behind a tree, to which the dog sneaks up behind him and draws the quail on his trouser seat. The dog shows it to Barney and, thinking it's the real bird, shoots himself in the rear. Barney then coaxes the bird out of hiding by placing a trail of bird seed that leads into his gun. Barney attempts to run home with the bird, but is tripped again by the dog and his gun is broken in half and the bird once again escapes to the railroad tracks. Barney tries shooting the bird again, and the bird runs away from the oncoming bullets but, after the dog switches the tracks, the bullets fly around and hit Barney's bottom again. The chase continues until Barney has the dog and bird cornered in a bush and fires at them. The dog pours ketchup all over him and pretends to have been shot. Barney ends up saying ""Please don't die. I'll do anything!"" to which the dog holds up a Bird Lover's Pledge to never harm another bird again, which Barney reluctantly signs."

It then cuts to the Karkonosze Mountains in Ukraine, where Soap, Price, Ghost, Roach, and other Task Force 141 members are seen walking through a dense forest. Delta Force operatives Sandman and Frost are up on a hillside aiming with a Barrett M82 at several Russian soldiers guarding a safehouse. After requesting permission to engage, Overlord gives them the go and the duo begin to eliminate the enemy soldiers. An AC-130 Spectre, callsign ""Spectre 6-4,"" then fires at the incoming waves of enemy Russians in a large field outside a series of barracks. After Spectre 6-4 clears the way for the Task Force, Soap's team advances into the safehouse and kills all remaining Russians inside. Roach plants a breaching charge on a wall, with Ghost entering the room and killing the soldiers inside. The team enters the room, where they notice pictures of an airport  and Bravo Six team. Soap discovers that the picture of Bravo Six has several faces crossed out, implying that each team member has been killed. They then hear a C4 detonator beeping and escape just before the explosion can kill them. The Task Force runs for a V-22 Osprey for exfil, while Spectre 6-4 provides covering fire for their escape. However, enemy RPG fire destroys Spectre 6-4, leaving the Task Force to fend for themselves. Another RPG is fired and explodes near Soap, knocking him semi-conscious and spitting blood. Sandman and Roach then drag Soap to the Osprey while Frost covers the evacuating operatives. Price then tells them to leave without him while he provides covering fire; Soap, however, refuses to leave him behind. Overlord orders the Osprey pilot to take off immediately, but Sandman argues that they cannot leave Price behind. Price shouts for them to go. Price is then shot and falls backward, struggling to get back up. Price pulls out his M1911 and downs more Russian soldiers before being shot again and overwhelmed by more Russian troops.  The screen then fades to black and cuts to the present day, revealing the scars that Soap had suffered from the explosion. After demanding that Shepherd tells him who Kingfish is, Shepherd throws him a dossier with a picture of Vladimir Makarov, declaring ""We'll get him."" Soap then takes his combat knife and stabs the picture of Makarov, ending the video."

A large part of the film is set in the late nineteenth century, and the action takes place in an abandoned hotel/sanatorium in Tannenfeld, Thuringia where most of the film was also shot.

The next day, the traumatized Deanna subdues a burglar who breaks into her apartment using the rapist's abandoned stun gun. Deanna, convinced the intruder is the same man who raped her, ties the burglar up, strips him down to nothing but his underwear and balaclava, and takes some of his blood. At work, Deanna steals urine samples, makes plans to go out with a friend and co-worker named Leanna on Thursday, and asks her boss, Doctor Tyson, to compare the burglar's blood to a swab of semen she had collected after being raped. Deanna tells Doctor Tyson that a friend was raped, and that the blood belongs to her ex-boyfriend, who she suspects was her assailant. Back at home, Deanna tortures the burglar by covering him in the urine samples, burning him with a blow torch, and jabbing him with syringes. When Thursday arrives, Deanna goes out to a nightclub with Leanne, and hours later returns to her building severely intoxicated. While stumbling up to her apartment, Deanna bumps into a neighbor and acquaintance named Trevor, who she seduces and has sex with. A relationship develops between the two, as Deanna becomes further unhinged, and begins suffering from nightmares. She also continues to torture the burglar, dressing in fetish-wear attire for the occasions, and attaining an almost sexual gratification from the man's suffering. One day, Deanna gives the burglar a handjob, and afterward destroys his genitals with needles and the blow torch. A week after castrating the burglar, Deanna hires a gigolo drug addict to sodomize him. While the addict has his way with the burglar, Deanna leaves and goes to Trevor's apartment. There, Deanna discovers circumstancial evidence indicating Trevor was her rapist, walks in on Trevor and Leanne having sex, and attacks them with a circular saw that was among Trevor's carpentry tools. Deanna beheads Leanne with the saw, and bashes Trevor's face in with it. Returning to her apartment, Deanna murders the gigolo by stabbing him in the neck with a knife after he reveals the burglar had died at some point during the rape. Deanna then goes to the hospital in search of Doctor Tyson, eventually spotting him seated in his parked car, dressed like her rapist and surrounded by sadistic pornography and stun guns identical to the one she was attacked with. When Doctor Tyson tries to pull her into the car, Deanna jams a cigarette lighter into one of his eyes, and knocks him out with one of the stun guns. Having finally found her rapist, Deanna abducts Doctor Tyson, and the film ends as she prepares to torture him.

He then wraps her body in a sheet, takes her upstairs, and hides her in his attic. He then phones Ray  and informs him of the crime. Referencing an earlier conversation in which a drunken Ray had suggested murdering Jenny, Taylor tries to convince him to help cover up the crime. Ray declines, leaving Taylor to deal with the consequences alone. He begins to clean the blood from the kitchen floor, and hears something moving in the attic. He goes to investigate, and hears Jenny screaming. Whilst investigating, he finds blood dripping from the loft hatch, and goes up to investigate, where he finds the body as he left it. As he climbs back down the ladder, he slips on the blood, and is knocked unconscious. On regaining consciousness, Taylor finds blood on his forehead, and looks up into the still-open attic, where he sees a hallucination of Jenny looking down at him. He goes to the bathroom and cleans the blood from his hands, head, and clothes, and finishes cleaning the kitchen. Terra , Jenny's friend, arrives, and finds that Jenny is missing. Taylor tells her that she has walked out, and left her phone. Fearing that Terra knows of the murder, he arms himself with a kitchen knife, but she leaves before he attacks her. Whilst disposing of the blood-stained towels used to clean the kitchen, Taylor takes a saw from his garage, and takes Jenny's body into the bathroom. Once he has put the body in the bath, Taylor closes Jenny's eyes, and prepares to cut her arm off. However, he is interrupted at the last moment by the shower curtain moving. He goes to investigate, and looks back to find Jenny's eyes now open again. The curtain moves again, and Taylor jumps back, hits the light switch, and falls to ground. The curtain is then pulled back, and a shadowed figure steps out from behind it. Taylor runs from the bathroom, and then the house. Whilst outside, a police car pulls up, and Taylor returns to the house. When Police Officer Diaz  knocks on the door, Taylor tries to stop her from entering the house. When she does, she begins to search the ground floor and, on finding nothing, goes to search upstairs. Taylor again attempts to convince her that there is no issue, and is forced to remain downstairs whilst Diaz searches the upper floor. Diaz does not enter the bathroom, and therefore does not discover Jenny's body, but Taylor stabs her in the neck as she turns to leave. The two struggle silently, with Taylor pushing Diaz's gun down into its holster to protect himself. He is interrupted by an apparition of Jenny standing at the door, giving Diaz time to draw her weapon and shoot him. The two separate, and fall against opposite sides of the room, where they sit against the walls, dying.

When the Decepticons learn of this, their combiner robots are deployed to attack, and a battle between them and their Autobot counterparts ensues, focusing on their ""Scramble Power"" - the interchangeability of the individual limbs - to the extent that at one point, Breakdown of the Stunticons connects to Superion to damage him. At the OVA's conclusion, Scramble City is activated and assumes its robot mode of Metroplex to rout the Decepticons. However, from the ocean depths, the Decepticons' own city, Trypticon, rises. This cliffhanger was never resolved as no direct sequel was ever produced. An extended commercial, called Scramble City Toys but often mistakenly identified as Scramble City 2, was released, but rather than wrap up the cliffhanger, it retold the OVA through stop-motion animation of the toys themselves, with one addition - the introduction of Galvatron, erroneously presented as one of Megatron's troops, rather than the recreated Decepticon leader himself."

Lio Convoy tells him to wait until the Cybertrons know what the spaceship is. Lio Junior feels Lio Convoy is ""treating him like a kid"". Tasmanian Kid proposes he go with Lio Junior to investigate. The other Cybertrons are displeased, but Tasmanian Kid says he will take responsibility for Lio Junior. Lio Convoy allows them to go. Lio Junior, Santon, Skywarp and Tasmanian Kid locate the ship, which is empty. The group searches inside the ship and, ignoring Skywarp's warnings, Lio Junior accidentally activates the ship. Skywarp quickly deactivates it and berates Lio Junior for his irresponsibility. Lio Junior later plays with more controls, activating the 'teleport gate'. The Cybertrons wonder what a teleport gate is, and Tasmanian Kid explains it can summon any Transformer from history. Lio Junior finds the control unit, but not before the Destrons find them. Max B snatches the control unit. LioJunior pursues Max B against the warnings of Tasmanian Kid. Lio Junior engages the Destron army, who tease him.

Apache delivers Lio Junior to Lio Convoy, who says he is disappointed; Lio Junior was supposed to investigate the spaceship, not fight Destrons. Lio Junior says the Destrons would have taken control of the teleport gate had he not intervened. Lio Convoy asks if the teleport gate was worth risking his friends for, and Lio Junior says he has no friends. Lio Convoy asks what Lio Junior's reason for fighting is. Lio Convoy explains that Cybertrons fight for peace in the galaxy. This makes Lio Junior believe he is not a Cybertron, and he runs away, wanting to defeat the Destrons. The Cybertronbase/ship flies leaves with the crew, sans LioJunior, in it, worrying over Tasmanian Kid. The Destrons report to Galvatron that they need a control unit to use the teleport gate. HellScream tells Galvatron he has scouts searching for Lio Junior, who has the control unit. Lio Junior is confronted by Galvatron and the other Destrons. Galvatron tells Lio Junior the Destrons will protect him, but he has to give them the control unit. Galvatron claims that the gate will destroy the planet in an hour if he does not give Galvatron the control device. An injured Tasmanian Kid appears, telling Lio Junior not to believe Galvatron. Lio Junior decides that if he prevents the planet's destruction, Lio Convoy, Skywarp and Santon will respect him. He agrees to help the Destrons, and Galvatron fires on Tasmanian Kid. At the Destron base, Lio Junior hands the control unit to Galvatron, who instructs the Destrons to release the teleport gate. Galvatron orders Gigastorm to search for Megatron, the ""greatest and most vicious Transformer in history."" Lio Junior is placed in a holding cell. Tasmanian Kid tells the Cybertrons that LioJunior defected to the Destrons. Tasmanian Kid says it is not his fault, as he just wants to become a respected warrior. The Destrons make their way to the ship and Gigastorm says he found Megatron's wavelength. They attempt to summon Megatron, but a mysterious giant Destron appears. Galvatron orders Hellscream to discover the identity of the giant Transformer. Hellscream tells Galvatron that the Transformer is called Majin Zarak. Galvatron is pleased; his new warrior is much stronger than Megatron. Galvatron taunts Lio Junior, telling him he will show him the power of Majin Zarak. Majin Zarak, piloted by Galvatron, shoots an energy blast into the sea, causing it to splash up to Majin Zarak's head. Majin Zarak transforms into an aircraft carrier and leaves. The Cybertrons watch Majin Zarak cruise through the ocean, and look at diagrams of his vehicle and robot mode. Lio Convoy is alarmed, and orders the Cybertrons to move out. Majin Zarak is cruising through the water with the Destrons on him. As they approach land the Cybertron ship flies above them, and Galvatron fires multiple guns at the Cybertrons, who hover above him, unable to get closer. They land and prepare to attack Majin Zarak. Lio Junior escapes from his holding cell. Dirgegun and Thrustol chase after him. Before they catch up, Santon and Skywarp arrive to protect him. The trio form Magnaboss, but Dirgegun and Thrustol fire on Magnaboss before retreating. Magnaboss returns to the spaceship and tries to activate the teleport gate, but there is an error. Magnaboss connects wiring from his injury to the computer, and uses it to supercharge the teleport unit. He activates it but falls into stasis lock. A beast warrior surrounded by a golden aura emerges. The Destrons launch Hellscream from Majin Zarak; he fires upon the Cybertrons as Lio Convoy decides to face Majin Zarak, instructing the Cybertrons to back him up. The Autorollers attack Lio Convoy, but Apache defeats them. Max B charges at the Cybertrons, but is knocked into the air by Bighorn. Diver and Bighorn stun Hellscream. Scuba takes down Dirgegun. Dirgegun, Hellscream, Max B and Thrustol retreat. Lio Convoy charges at Majin Zarak. He boards Majin Zarak, blowing Gigastorm away. Galvatron transforms Majin Zarak, stunning Lio Convoy. Galvatron begins charging the cannons on Majin Zarak's back, and Lio Convoy tells the Cybertrons to run as far as possible. He hits all the Cybertrons, injuring them. Majin Zarak receives a Cybertron transmission, telling him to come to B-2, signed Convoy. He believes this was sent by Lio Convoy, and that he was not damaged by the blast. Majin Zarak leaves the battlefield. A voice speaks to Lio Convoy, who is under a pile of rocks, saying he has been summoned by Magnaboss to help the Cybertrons. Still glowing, it is revealed that the voice belongs to Optimus Primal. Lio Convoy breaks free of the rocks, finding Magnaboss waiting for him. He has rescued the Cybertrons. Tasmanian Kid arrives, saying he cannot sleep while the other Cybertrons fight. Primal joins the Cybertrons. Lio Convoy sends Scuba and Diver to use the base computer to search for Majin Zarak's weak point. Lio Convoy, Apache, Bighorn, Magnaboss and Kid prepare to fight Majin Zarak. The Insectrons confirm that Majin Zarak is heading to point B-2. Magnaboss notes that once Majin Zarak enters, he will not be able to leave because of the cliff-laden terrain. The Cybertrons head into battle. Majin Zarak and Galvatron arrive at point B-2. Galvatron calls for Lio Convoy to come out. Lio Convoy calls out from above, and to Galvatron's awe, Convoy stands next to him. Galvatron is angry, asking why Convoy came. Convoy tells him that he came to defeat him. Galvatron realises that the 'Convoy' who sent the transmission was the same one. Majin Zarak charges, and Magnaboss and Kid combine their power. Magnaboss pushes against Majin Zarak, bringing him to a halt. He then picks him up and hurls him backward. Majin Zarak comes crashing down, and Galvatron falls out. He lands on a small ship with Gigastorm and flies off. Scuba tells the Cybertrons that even though Galvatron is not piloting it, Majin Zarak was alive the whole time, and is now acting on its own. Majin Zarak fires at Magnaboss and Kid, knocking them over. Convoy, Lio Convoy, Apache and Bighorn fire on Majin Zarak to no avail. As the combat continues, Diver radios Convoy and Lio Convoy, telling them Majin Zarak's weak point is the third eye on his forehead. The two Convoys power up. Lio Convoy is now Flash Lio Convoy, and Convoy is now Burning Convoy. Burning Convoy rides Flash Lio Convoy to Majin Zarak's third eye. Burning Convoy drives his fist into Majin Zarak's third eye. Flash Lio Convoy and Burning Convoy open their Matrix compartments, combining forces in an ultimate Double Matrix Blaster attack. It hits Majin Zarak directly in the eye, destroying him. The Cybertrons agree that the gate was sent to Gaea by whoever made it to be destroyed, due to a flaw in it that can be used to destroy the universe. Convoy returns through the teleport gate, and the Cybertrons destroy it to protect the universe."

Galvatron begins charging the cannons on Majin Zarak's back, and Lio Convoy tells the Cybertrons to run as far as possible. He hits all the Cybertrons, injuring them. Majin Zarak receives a Cybertron transmission, telling him to come to B-2, signed Convoy. He believes this was sent by Lio Convoy, and that he was not damaged by the blast. Majin Zarak leaves the battlefield. A voice speaks to Lio Convoy, who is under a pile of rocks, saying he has been summoned by Magnaboss to help the Cybertrons. Still glowing, it is revealed that the voice belongs to Optimus Primal. Lio Convoy breaks free of the rocks, finding Magnaboss waiting for him. He has rescued the Cybertrons. Tasmanian Kid arrives, saying he cannot sleep while the other Cybertrons fight. Primal joins the Cybertrons. Lio Convoy sends Scuba and Diver to use the base computer to search for Majin Zarak's weak point. Lio Convoy, Apache, Bighorn, Magnaboss and Kid prepare to fight Majin Zarak.

Lio Convoy calls out from above, and to Galvatron's awe, Convoy stands next to him. Galvatron is angry, asking why Convoy came. Convoy tells him that he came to defeat him. Galvatron realises that the 'Convoy' who sent the transmission was the same one. Majin Zarak charges, and Magnaboss and Kid combine their power. Magnaboss pushes against Majin Zarak, bringing him to a halt. He then picks him up and hurls him backward. Majin Zarak comes crashing down, and Galvatron falls out. He lands on a small ship with Gigastorm and flies off. Scuba tells the Cybertrons that even though Galvatron is not piloting it, Majin Zarak was alive the whole time, and is now acting on its own. Majin Zarak fires at Magnaboss and Kid, knocking them over. Convoy, Lio Convoy, Apache and Bighorn fire on Majin Zarak to no avail. As the combat continues, Diver radios Convoy and Lio Convoy, telling them Majin Zarak's weak point is the third eye on his forehead. The two Convoys power up.

The Destrons also notice the spaceship. Galvatron and his brother Gigastorm discuss it, and Galvatron decides the ship is a positive sign. At the Maximal base, Apache notes the ship has landed at the North Pole. Lio Convoy sends him to investigate. Lio Junior asks to help, but the older Cybertrons tell him he is too young. Lio Convoy tells him to wait until the Cybertrons know what the spaceship is. Lio Junior feels Lio Convoy is ""treating him like a kid"". Tasmanian Kid proposes he go with Lio Junior to investigate. The other Cybertrons are displeased, but Tasmanian Kid says he will take responsibility for Lio Junior. Lio Convoy allows them to go. Lio Junior, Santon, Skywarp and Tasmanian Kid locate the ship, which is empty. The group searches inside the ship and, ignoring Skywarp's warnings, Lio Junior accidentally activates the ship. Skywarp quickly deactivates it and berates Lio Junior for his irresponsibility. Lio Junior later plays with more controls, activating the 'teleport gate'. The Cybertrons wonder what a teleport gate is, and Tasmanian Kid explains it can summon any Transformer from history. Lio Junior finds the control unit, but not before the Destrons find them. Max B snatches the control unit. LioJunior pursues Max B against the warnings of Tasmanian Kid. Lio Junior engages the Destron army, who tease him. The other Cybertrons emerge from the ship and battle the Destrons. Lio Junior tells Santon and Skywarp to fuse with him, but they refuse. Lio Junior does not understand, and jumps back into battle. Lio Junior regains the control unit, but is outnumbered and takes a heavy beating. Hellscream fires a missile at him, but Tasmanian Kid jumps in the way, saving Lio Junior but injuring himself. Tasmanian Kid goes into stasis lock and the Destrons gain the upper hand. Lio Junior pleads with them to stop, but the Destrons ignore him. Before the Destrons can destroy Lio Junior, Cybertron reinforcements arrive and repel the Destrons. Diver and Scuba try comforting Tasmanian Kid, who is badly injured. Apache delivers Lio Junior to Lio Convoy, who says he is disappointed; Lio Junior was supposed to investigate the spaceship, not fight Destrons. Lio Junior says the Destrons would have taken control of the teleport gate had he not intervened. Lio Convoy asks if the teleport gate was worth risking his friends for, and Lio Junior says he has no friends. Lio Convoy asks what Lio Junior's reason for fighting is. Lio Convoy explains that Cybertrons fight for peace in the galaxy. This makes Lio Junior believe he is not a Cybertron, and he runs away, wanting to defeat the Destrons. The Cybertronbase/ship flies leaves with the crew, sans LioJunior, in it, worrying over Tasmanian Kid. The Destrons report to Galvatron that they need a control unit to use the teleport gate. HellScream tells Galvatron he has scouts searching for Lio Junior, who has the control unit. Lio Junior is confronted by Galvatron and the other Destrons. Galvatron tells Lio Junior the Destrons will protect him, but he has to give them the control unit. Galvatron claims that the gate will destroy the planet in an hour if he does not give Galvatron the control device. An injured Tasmanian Kid appears, telling Lio Junior not to believe Galvatron. Lio Junior decides that if he prevents the planet's destruction, Lio Convoy, Skywarp and Santon will respect him. He agrees to help the Destrons, and Galvatron fires on Tasmanian Kid. At the Destron base, Lio Junior hands the control unit to Galvatron, who instructs the Destrons to release the teleport gate. Galvatron orders Gigastorm to search for Megatron, the ""greatest and most vicious Transformer in history."" Lio Junior is placed in a holding cell. Tasmanian Kid tells the Cybertrons that LioJunior defected to the Destrons. Tasmanian Kid says it is not his fault, as he just wants to become a respected warrior. The Destrons make their way to the ship and Gigastorm says he found Megatron's wavelength. They attempt to summon Megatron, but a mysterious giant Destron appears. Galvatron orders Hellscream to discover the identity of the giant Transformer. Hellscream tells Galvatron that the Transformer is called Majin Zarak. Galvatron is pleased; his new warrior is much stronger than Megatron. Galvatron taunts Lio Junior, telling him he will show him the power of Majin Zarak. Majin Zarak, piloted by Galvatron, shoots an energy blast into the sea, causing it to splash up to Majin Zarak's head. Majin Zarak transforms into an aircraft carrier and leaves. The Cybertrons watch Majin Zarak cruise through the ocean, and look at diagrams of his vehicle and robot mode. Lio Convoy is alarmed, and orders the Cybertrons to move out. Majin Zarak is cruising through the water with the Destrons on him. As they approach land the Cybertron ship flies above them, and Galvatron fires multiple guns at the Cybertrons, who hover above him, unable to get closer. They land and prepare to attack Majin Zarak.

Capone also has O'Bannion killed and makes a play for Maureen Flannery, the widow of one of Colosimo's men. Weiss and Moran return the favor by ordering Torrio to be shot. Capone retaliates by knocking off Weiss and forcing merchants throughout the city to pay for ""protection."" A sergeant in the Chicago police, Schaefer, is promoted to captain and vows to end the bloodshed and extortion and put Scarface Capone behind bars. With the heat on from the cops, a crooked newspaperman named Keely tries to bribe Schaefer but fails. So he persuades Capone to move to Florida until things cool down. From a safe distance, Capone masterminds the St. Valentine's Day Massacre, with several of Moran's men gunned down in a Chicago garage. Capone and Moran call a truce, but when he learns Keely has been helping a Moran plot to kill him, Capone ends the reporter's life instead. Maureen finally has her fill of Capone's corruption and violence, while Schaefer and the feds find a way to finally put Capone away -- on charges of tax evasion, earning him 11 years at Alcatraz."

Lettie's Aunt Hortense, fearing that Barton is a fortune hunter, tells Lettie she is not the heiress she thought she was and that she has been living off her aunt's charity. With no fortune to hunt, Barton informs Lettie that an artist cannot be burdened with the responsibility of a wife. Outside the opera house, Lettie meets a chorus girl named Honey , who is preparing to leave with her theatrical troupe in a caravan heading West. When the troupe's producer mistakes Lettie for the star, she joins the group as ""Mary Varden"". The troupe's wagon train is escorted by Captain Tex Autry  of the U.S. Cavalry and his singing plainsmen. The troupe misses the wagon train, however, and must travel alone. On their way to San Francisco, the caravan is ambushed by a gang of thieves. Tex and his men arrive on the scene and following a gunfight, the gang is chased off. After Tex saves Lettie from a runaway wagon, he comments on the foolishness of risking his men's lives for a bunch of ""crazy showgirls"". Angered by his insolence, Lettie decides to walk rather than ride with Tex. Eventually she gets tired and asks Tex if she can ride with him. The troupe arrives safely at Fort Henry, which is run by Colonel Seward . An Indian named Young Deer warns Tex that Chief White Eagle is preparing to attack the army. When horses are stolen from the fort by a renegade named Buck LaCrosse , Tex saves the horses. Utah Joe , who is in league with Chief White Eagle, falsely accuses Tex of complicity with the Indians, and Tex is soon arrested for treason. Aunt Hortense arrives with Judge Forsythe Lane , who hopes to marry Lettie and use her money to run for president. Aunt Hortense encourages her to marry Lane. Lettie appeals to Lane on Tex's behalf, hinting that she will marry him if he will save Tex. As the wagon train prepares to leave, Lettie sadly says goodbye to Tex, and Lane promises to join Lettie after the trial. However, Lane double-crosses Lettie and helps to secure Tex's conviction. Following his conviction and death sentence, Tex escapes with the help of his friends. Suspicious that Utah Joe has promised to supply Chief White Eagle with ammunition, Tex orders his friend Frog  to join the wagon train to spy on Utah Joe. While the caravan camps, Frog tells Lettie that Lane encouraged Tex's conviction. Honey, who has fallen in love with Frog, tells Lettie that Lane was probably jealous of Lettie's feelings for Tex, but Lettie denies loving the soldier. When Utah Joe announces plans to take a new route through Kern Valley, Frog warns that the valley is filled with renegades and unfriendly Indians. Later that night Tex arrives and overhears Utah Joe direct Chief White Eagle to the wagons stocked with gunpowder. Tex pulls his gun on them, and a fight ensues, during which LaCrosse arrives on the scene. As Frog and Tex try to fight off the renegades, the soldiers ride up. Chief White Eagle is shot during the scuffle, but Utah Joe escapes. LaCrosse is arrested and, under the threat of a firing squad, confesses that Utah Joe instigated the horse stealing at the fort, while he let loose the clever black stallion who opened the corral gate. LaCrosse also warns the caravan that Utah Joe is leading them into an ambush. As the caravan prepares to leave, Utah Joe, now dressed as an Indian, sends a smoke signal, and the Indians approach. Frog is grazed by a bullet and inadvertently becomes attached to the underside of the runaway powder wagon. Tex manages to save him, and igniting the wagon, sends it into a throng of Indians. The Indians retreat once the plainsmen arrive, and as the wagon train departs, Tex and Lettie kiss, with Honey nursing Frog behind the embracing couple."

Married to a very devout wife, Susheela, and a father of two , Kanji is a hardcore non-believer and routinely indulges in activities such as tricking customers into paying huge sums of money for his statues under false pretenses, and drinking alcohol while on pilgrimage. He also disrupts a local festival in order to get his son away from the celebration. The Hindu priest presiding over the function, Siddheshwar Maharaj, shouts at him and says that ""God will curse you"". That night a small earthquake occurs in Mumbai, but there are no damages at all to property or life - except for Kanji Bhai's shop, which has been destroyed completely. Susheela, along with Kanji's neighbours, tells him to accept God so that his misfortunes will end. Kanji refuses, and digs through the shop's rubble to find his Godrej safe, which is still intact. Opening it, it he produces his insurance papers, saying that ""no damage has been done"". However, the next day at the insurance office, Kanji and Mahadev are told that the policy does not cover any damage caused by earthquakes, which are classified as an ""Act of God"". Without insurance coverage, Kanji attempts to sell the land his shop used to sit on, but is told by his real estate agent that there is a rumour going around saying the plot is ""cursed"", and that no buyers have come forward. Out of options, Kanji decides to file a lawsuit against God. At the high court, Kanji is unable to get a lawyer, as none of them want the hassle of such a lawsuit. He eventually visits Hanif Qureshi , a poor Muslim lawyer who was attacked and crippled by Islamic extremists for taking Hindu clients. Qureshi agrees to help Kanji, but warns that since he is bed-ridden without the use of his legs, he can only file the case, and Kanji will have to argue it himself. Kanji agrees, and together they send legal notices to the insurance company, as well as Siddheshwar Maharaj, summoning him to court along with his senior, Gopi Maiyya  and the group's founder, Leeladhar . Although a Guru of the Sect  asks the three of them to at least arrange a meeting with Kanji and hear out his problem, they refuse, deciding instead to confront him in court. During the preliminary hearing, Siddheshwar takes the stand, calling Kanji a ""fool and sinner"" and saying that God would not come to Earth for the likes of him. The insurance company's lawyer  asks the judge to dismiss the case immediately, calling it a waste of the court's time, but Kanji points out that since religious groups claim to represent God on Earth and speak on behalf of Him, they are answerable for his actions, and that the Constitution gives him the right to take legal action against them. The Judge agrees, and the court decides to go forward with the case. When Kanji and Mahadev walk out of the courtroom, they are confronted by a large crowd, which is only held back by Police Officers and court guards. Worried about the safety of his family, Kanji tells Mahadev they should split up to go home and check on his wife and kids. However, Kanji soon ends up in front of a group of fundamentalists, who chase him with sticks and daggers. Meanwhile, a handsome stranger  appears at the top of one of Mumbai's skyscrapers, wearing a suit and a black overcoat, and twirling a metallic key chain shaped like a small peacock feather on his index finger . The stranger gets on a motorcycle, rides it off the roof, lands on the road without any damage to himself or the bike, and then rescues Kanji Bhai by lifting him up, putting him on the seat behind him and riding away. The assailants follow on their jeeps, but the stranger manages to evade them after an extended chase, by performing some seemingly impossible stunts on his motorcycle. When Kanjibhai asks his name, he identifies himself as ""Krishna Vasudev Yadav, from Gokul"". He drops Kanji off on a safe street and gives him directions on how to get back home. When Kanji asks if he can give him a lift the rest of the way, he replies that ""My job is just to show you the path, you have to walk it yourself."" Kanji walks home and discovers that his house has been stoned by a mob, and Susheela is leaving with his children. Though he begs her not to go, and his son refuses to leave his father, Susheela, fearing for the children's safety, takes them away to her brother's place. Dejected, Kanji sits home drinking alone, when Yadav shows up at the door with a bag, declaring that he is ""God"" and that ""Muslims call me a Prophet, Christians call me Jesus the Messiah, and for you, I am Krishna."" However, when Kanji calls Mahadev from next door, Yadav pretends to be normal human being, and produces a document which says that he has purchased the house from Kanji's landlord. Yadav says that he is a consultant, and that he will be staying there for a while. He allows Kanji to continue living there, provided he can use Kanji's household furniture and kitchen for the duration of his stay. The lawsuit hits all the major news networks and causes a public outcry, with most people berating Kanji bhai and calling him ""insane"". As Kanji and Yadav watch this from home, Yadav tells Kanji that people are getting a false impression of him, and to rectify that, he needs to talk to the media and tell them what he is trying to accomplish. Kanji bhai appears on a program called ""OMG"", and explains that his intention is not to insult religion or its beliefs, but to question the ways in which people's faith is exploited and commercialied by religious organizations. He also easily puts down several arguments raised by the show's audience. The hostess of the show  herself admits that Kanji bhai has changed the way she views Faith. The interview receives widespread coverage, and public opinion swings rapidly in Kanji's favour. Meanwhile, hundreds of people, whose insurance claims were rejected because the damages were caused by ""Acts Of God"" show up at Hanif Qureshi's house, asking to join Kanji in his lawsuit. With Muslims and Christians among them, Kanji bhai agrees to plead their cases along with his own, and broadens the lawsuit to include churches and mosques as well. At the next court session, during which Catholic priests and Muslim Mullahs are also summoned to the courtroom as defendants. In the session that follows, the insurance company's lawyer points out that Kanji has no way to prove that what happened to him or his fellow plaintiffs were Acts of God, and hence he cannot hold God accountable. Kanjibhai is unable to answer. The Judge declares the court adjourned, then sets the next session for a date one month later, and warns Kanji that he will need irrefutable proof that the disasters were Acts of God, or the case will be dismissed. At the house, Yadav tells Kanji to read the Bhagavad Gita, and that all holy books, such as the Quran and The Bible contain answers for all of his problems. Kanji Bhai studies all three of the Holy texts intensively over the month, during which time Susheela returns to him with their children. At the next session, Kanji points out passages in the holy books which says that all of Creation is God's own, and it is his will to allow it to grow or to destroy it. As he is finishing his statement that if this is what religion irrefutably believes, then according to their own sacred texts, God is liable for the damages, Kanji is overcome by a coughing fit and falls over, unconscious. He is rushed to the hospital, where doctors attempt to revive him but are ultimately unsuccessful, leaving him comatose. A while later, Yadav shows up in Kanji's hospital room, and places a hand on his forehead. Kanji wakes up, and is told by Yadav that the left side of his body is now paralyed. He then touches Kanji with his keychain, immediately reviving him from his invalid state, and as Kanji rises from the bed, Yadav assumes his true form, revealing to Kanji Bhai that he is Lord Krishna. Kanji asks him why Krishna has chosen to help him - an atheist - and Krishna replies that he shows no favouritism between believers and non believers. As they sit down to talk, Kanji asks God why he created religions, to which Krishna replies that he created man, and man has created religions, and that if one were to attempt to lead them beyond religion, then he would become a religion unto himself. Kanji bhai shows skepticism at this line of thought, and at that point Krishna reveals that Kanji has been in his coma for one month and shows him what has been happening in that time: the lawsuit's verdict was in his favour and religious organizations were ordered by court to the pay compensation to all the plaintiffs; and, following that, people have started calling Kanji bhai a ""swami"" and are singing devotional songs in his name; some have even started calling Kanji the eleventh avatar of Vishnu. Meanwhile, Leeladhar, Gopi Maiyya, and Siddheshwar have opened a new temple in Kanji bhai's name, complete with a statue of him, and they have already gotten millions in donations. And today, as per Kanji's living will, he is about to be removed from the ventilator, and thousands of people have gathered to accompany his funeral procession. Kanji is appalled by this turn of events, and Krishna, as Yadav, takes him on his motorcycle to the ""Kanji Temple"" to stop the procession. At the temple, Kanji walks up to the dais and yells at the crowd, pointing out that he had done all of his work to stop events exactly like this, and says that ""Our world is beautiful, so why would God stay inside the four walls of a temple? If you want to seek God, then seek Him inside yourself, and not inside some idol made of rock."" Kanji then beheads his own statue with a tire iron, and tells the crowd to tear down the temple. As the mob grows unruly, they blame the three pundits for what happened, and attempt to assault them. But Kanji intervenes, and says that their true punishment should be to walk away in shame. As Leeladhar leaves, he stops by Kanji and tells him that faith is like an addiction, and will not let go of people. He gestures toward the crowd and says, ""These are not God-loving people, they are God-fearing people,"" and walks away calmly, implying that he believes they will all return to them someday. Kanji approaches Yadav  to thank him for his help, but is distracted for a second by the crowd, and when he looks back, both Yadav and the motorcycle have disappeared. As he meets his family and they embrace him in reunion, Kanji notices that Yadav's key chain has been left behind, and is lying on the ground. He picks it up and is about to secure it inside his jacket when he hears Krishna's voice, telling him not to start believing in idol/rock possession  and that he should get rid of the key chain. Kanji Bhai smiles to himself, then throws it away in the sky."

Unfortunately, he also left her broke, living in Rhode Island and working as a receptionist in a museum run by Clara, her aunt. A stroke of luck comes Kim's way when notified that an uncle in Las Vegas has died and left her a 50% interest in a hotel-casino. She excitedly takes Aunt Clara there, but in reality, the hotel is a ramshackle mess and her partner is heavily in debt. Kim is deceived into believing that the hotel she owns is actually the thriving Flamingo Hotel, right across the street. So it comes as quite a surprise to its real owner, Victor Monte, when a total stranger begins behaving as if the place is hers. Taffy Tremaine is performing there, and she's just jealous enough to be concerned that Victor might take a fancy to this new woman rather than to her. Kim eventually learns the truth about the two hotels, but catches a break by being introduced to Elliot Atterbury, a naive rich boy who'd like to own a Vegas hotel. Together they spruce up Kim's hotel, rename it, hire Taffy to perform and give the Flamingo a run for its money. Taffy happily takes up with Elliot instead, while Victor concedes defeat. Once a gambler who lost everything, as Kim's father did, he tells Kim that he's gone broke again from losses at the tables and from the Flamingo's loss of business, so he's leaving town. Kim persuades him to stay, wanting them to become partners in more ways than one. Victor agrees, whereupon Kim learns that he and the Flamingo are actually having no money troubles at all, their new partnership being what he'd had in mind all along.

The cattlemen suspect that the turpentiners are rustling their cattle, not knowing that the man organizing the rustling is Len Parker , a cattleman. Arthur Autry is among the cattlemen who believe they should raid the turpentiners and burn them out. Arthur's fair-minded son, Gene Autry , opposes the action, and is in love with Milly Baynum , the stepdaughter of the leader of the turpentiners. When Gene warns the turpentiners of the upcoming raid, his good intentions backfire as the turpentiners fight back and his father is wounded. Believing that Gene was fighting against the cattlemen, his father disowns him, and Gene leaves his home. Two years later Gene returns to Pine Ridge as the star of Colonel Frog Millhouse's Wild West show. Although glad to see Milly again, Gene is distraught to learn that his father is now destitute after his cattle were secretly stolen by Parker. After paying all of his father's bills, Gene learns from Milly that Arthur's cattle have been grazing in a distant meadow, and when Gene investigates, he is captured by two of Parker's henchmen. Parker orders his henchmen to replace Arthur's cattle with his own and take the stolen animals to Fox Canyon. Back in town, Frog waits anxiously for Gene's arrival so the show can begin. One of Parker's henchmen tells Frog about Gene being captured. Frog is forced to start the show using a double for Gene. Believing that Gene has escaped, Parker orders his right-hand man, Jeff Galloway , to kill him, and Galloway shoots the double. Meanwhile, Gene, who has escaped his captors, arrives back in town and learns about the crime. He tells Sheriff Martin  to meet him at Arthur's ranch. When he arrives, Gene discovers that his father is dead, and rushing over to the Baynum cabin, Gene finds Milly's stepfather Bayliss has also been murdered. Because Bayliss was bludgeoned with Gene's gun, which Parker's men had stolen, Sheriff Martin arrests Gene for the murder and takes him to jail. Believing that Gene will be set free because he is a cattleman, the turpentiners arrive at the jail intending to lynch him. Frog, Martin, and Milly prevent the lynching and Gene escapes. He goes to Parker's office, where he finds a receipt for the sale of his father's cattle. While Gene attempts to take Parker and Galloway to the sheriff, a gun battle between the cattlemen and turpentiners breaks out in the street and Parker, who killed both Arthur and Bayliss, gets away. Gene and his fellow entertainers chase after Parker and his men, and while the show people round up the gang, Gene apprehends Parker who is taken to jail. With the feud now ended, Gene and Milly decide to get married."

After his wife's death, King Magnus marries the beautiful Ravenna after rescuing her from the Dark Army, an invading force of glass soldiers. Ravenna, who is in fact a powerful sorceress and the Dark Army's master, kills Magnus on their wedding night after noting that men like him exploit the beauty of women and discard them. As Ravenna usurps control of the entire kingdom, Duke Hammond escapes the castle with his son William, but is unable to rescue Snow White, who is captured by Ravenna's brother Finn. Snow White is then locked away in the north tower of the castle. Tabor is left in ruins under Ravenna's rule as she periodically drains the youth from young women in order to maintain a spell once cast by her mother which allows her to keep her beauty. When Snow White comes of age, Ravenna learns from her Magic Mirror that Snow White is destined to destroy her unless Ravenna consumes the young girl's heart, which will make her immortal. Ravenna orders Finn to bring her Snow White, but she escapes into the Dark Forest, where Ravenna has no power. Eric the Huntsman, a widower who has survived the Dark Forest, is brought to Ravenna, who orders him to lead Finn in pursuit of Snow White. In exchange, she promises to revive his deceased wife, Sarah. Duke Hammond learns that Snow White is alive and has fled into the Dark Forest. William, Snow White's childhood friend, later infiltrates Finn's band as a bowman to find her. The Huntsman tracks down Snow White in the Dark Forest but refuses to hand her over until he knows Ravenna will keep her word. When Finn admits that Ravenna cannot resurrect the dead, the Huntsman helps Snow White to escape, promising to escort her to Duke Hammond's castle in exchange for a reward of gold. The two leave the Dark Forest, escape the troll and pass through a fishing village where all the women have disfigured themselves in order to escape Ravenna, and where he learns Snow White's true identity. He then leaves her in the care of the women but returns when he sees the village being burned down by Finn's men. Snow White and the Huntsman eventually meet a band of dwarves &mdash; Beith, Muir, Quert, Coll, Duir, Gort, Nion, and Gus. Muir discovers that Snow White is the only person who can defeat Ravenna and end her reign. As they travel through a fairy sanctuary, the group is attacked by Finn's men, resulting in Gus' death. The Huntsman kills Finn after learning he abetted in the murder of his wife. William reveals himself and helps defeat the soldiers before joining the others in their journey to Hammond's castle. Ravenna disguises herself as William and tempts Snow White into eating a poisoned apple, but is forced to flee when the Huntsman and William discover her. William kisses Snow White &mdash; whom he believes to be dead &mdash; without seeing that she has shed a solitary tear. She is taken to Hammond's castle. As she lies in repose, the Huntsman professes his regret for not saving Snow White, who reminds him of his wife, and kisses her, breaking the spell; she awakens after a second tear has fallen. Snow White then takes command of the Duke's army and leads them into battle against Ravenna. The Dwarves infiltrate Tabor through the sewers and open the gates, which allows the Duke's army to invade the castle. Snow White confronts Ravenna, but is overpowered. Ravenna is about to kill Snow White and consume her heart when Snow White stabs her in the heart instead, causing Ravenna to wither and die. Hammond's army is victorious, and Snow White is crowned Queen of the restored kingdom.

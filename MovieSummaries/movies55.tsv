He is forcibly sent to college by Father Rozario but is a complete misfit in class. One day he solves a complex mathematics problem in class surprising his classmates. Though shunned by the rest of his class, Ria  becomes his friend and he gradually warms up to her too. His feelings soon turn into love but he realizes that Ria considers him as only a friend. But he is unwilling to let her go. Meanwhile Vinod learns that Ria is in love with another classmate, Aditya . Ria's father is angered on learning about her love. He shuts her up and prevents her from contacting anyone. But Vinod comes and meets her on the pretext of getting some old clothes for himself to wear. Pitied by Vinod, her father allows him. But Vinod uses the chance and escapes with Ria. He convinces her that she will meet Aditya. Vinod has set up a secret place for executing his plan of wooing Ria. He makes her stay with him, while convincing her by talking about the never-impending Aditya's arrival. On one such day, he reveals his miserable past, where he is made to work for paid labour after being orphaned at an early age. He revolts against the oppression one day against the illegal child labour in vogue at his place. Promptly he is beaten black and blue for his profanity. Moreover he also loses his girlfriend to rapists in that place, who also kill her. Somehow he manages to escape from them and seeks refuge in the place of Father Rozario. Ria is really touched by his past. Incidentally the police and Aditya arrive at the place. While Vinod was away to get some food, they try to make Ria understand that Vinod was a psychopath. Yet Ria scoffs at their claims, citing his gentlemanly behaviour over the days she was put up alone with him. Vinod, learning that the police have arrived at the scene, begins to indulge in mass violence. He opens fire, killing a police constable. Forcing them out of their hideout, he manages to evade the police Inspector and Aditya and successfully brings Ria back to their original place of stay. Ria soon identifies the tiger out of the cow's skin. Vinod pleads with her, telling her that all he wanted in his life was her presence with him. But Ria called him a friend and stated her inability to accept him as her partner for life. Meanwhile Aditya regains consciousness and comes back to attack Vinod and rescue his girlfriend. A violent fight follows, where Vinod defies his puny self and treats Aditya with disdain. The fight culminates with Vinod, Aditya and Ria finding themselves at the edge of a cliff. While Ria clutches a tree bark tightly, Vinod and Aditya slip out and barely manage to hold either of her hands. Ria is forced to a situation where she needs to choose between her boyfriend and friend. Aditya's pleas notwithstanding, Ria doesn't have the heart to kill Vinod. The epic of a cliffhanger finally ends with Vinod smiling wryly at Ria and letting go of her hands himself. He falls dead into the deep valley.  * Soham Chakraborty as Vinod * Srabanti Chatterjee as Ria * Rehaan Roy as Aditya * Nagesh as Father Rozario * Biswajit Chakraborty as Police Inspector * Saswata Chatterjee

But when Kaya's parents realize Aman had proposed to her, they become sad and grave, and Kaya's mother earnestly persuades her father to tell them the truth. Kaya's mother reveals the curse upon their family. Kaya's father is a descendant of an ancient royal family. Some 300 years ago, the brother of the then king Ranjeet Singh had attempted to molest a beautiful girl in the palace. The girl escaped and jumped to her death. It turned out that the girl was the daughter of the royal guru, Acharya Sachidanand, and that the girl was about to be wed. The acharya, a wise and powerful spiritual master, was enraged beyond belief. He pronounced a terrible curse upon Ranjeet Singh: no daughter in Ranjeet Singh's line shall ever enjoy marriage; if they ever attempt to marry or become engaged, they will immediately meet with death. Aman and Kaya are devastated. He reaches out to professor Pashupati, an expert in the occult. The professor explains that generational curses  are typically connected with an evil spirit. This spirit is the keeper of the curse, and it executes the curse . Aman recollects that the evil spirit had caused their car accident. Aman suggests they destroy the spirit. The bemused professor laughs this off and urges Aman to forget Kaya and move on. Aman and his friend Shubh are disappointed. Aman is persistent.

The evil spirit is relentless. It attacks Kaya and tries to bury her alive. They save her just in time, but she goes into hypoxic shock.

The acharya, a wise and powerful spiritual master, was enraged beyond belief. He pronounced a terrible curse upon Ranjeet Singh: no daughter in Ranjeet Singh's line shall ever enjoy marriage; if they ever attempt to marry or become engaged, they will immediately meet with death. Aman and Kaya are devastated. He reaches out to professor Pashupati, an expert in the occult. The professor explains that generational curses  are typically connected with an evil spirit. This spirit is the keeper of the curse, and it executes the curse . Aman recollects that the evil spirit had caused their car accident. Aman suggests they destroy the spirit. The bemused professor laughs this off and urges Aman to forget Kaya and move on. Aman and his friend Shubh are disappointed. Aman is persistent. He looks up some of the professors work and retrieves  a ""cursed"" book from the library. Convinced that Aman is determined and capable, the professor agrees to help them. Their first stop is an abandoned movie theater. The professor explains that it is haunted by several spirits, and some of the noble spirits may be able to help them locate the evil curse-keeper. Aman and Kaya enter the theater. They are surrounded by spirits, and one of them splatters a few drops of blood on Kaya's wrists. The professor interprets: the drops are the co-ordinates of the ancient kingdom of Magha, present day Mahipalpur. They arrive at Mahipalpur and settle into the decrepit government guest house. The evil spirit is relentless. It attacks Kaya and tries to bury her alive. They save her just in time, but she goes into hypoxic shock. The professor describes a water-immersion method to send Shubh back in time. Shubh is again attacked by the spirit, but this time he returns with an amulet. The amulet reveals the clue that leads them to Rani Mohini, the evil spirit, the keeper of the curse. Aided by the curator of the 300-year old Magha jail, the professor performs a seance to invoke the spirit of Ranjeet Singh. This spirit reveals the sinister history of the royal family. Rani Mohini was never satisfied with her station as the second wife of Raja Gajsingh. She was also a sorceress. She plotted to assassinate the King and his two sons, Ranjeet and Kuljeet. Her assassins killed Raja Gajsingh, but were ultimately defeated and killed by the royal guard. Ranjeet Singh ascended the throne, and, upon learning of Rani Mohini's dark powers, promptly arranged to execute her. Rani Mohini, however, created a black charm  to keep her soul on earth. Upon her execution, her soul became the keeper of the curse  and would torment Ranjeet Singh's family for ever. Kaya's conditions worsens. She is wheeled into surgery. The professor and Aman and Shubh hurry into the River Palace to confront the evil spirit of Rani Mohini. They connect the clues from the amulet and from Ranjeet Singh, and deduce that the spirit of Mohini can be despatched to the nether world when her mortal remains  are dissolved. After a difficult and lengthy battle with the spirit, Aman floods the River Palace. He nearly drowns , but Shubh saves him just in time. The film ends with Aman narrating how the power of love can overcome any obstacle."

What their wives don't know is that their husbands cheat on them often with not one, but many women. Yogi has already been caught by Maya after the later hired her new found friend Kishan , a private detective, to check on Yogi. Now Yogi's status in the marriage is reduced to that of a butler at home. Yet Yogi still has aspirations for more hanky panky if the right opportunity comes along. Raj is in good shape, as Sanjana is quite gullible and suspects nothing. However, Sanjana finds out from Maya that the necklace that Raj had supposedly bought only for her actually was a buy one, get one free deal. So where is the other necklace? Shivani, Mala, and Sanjana all get together, and Mala decides to hire Kishan to tail Raj. Kishan has built his reputation as a man who saves marriages by getting erring husbands to mend their ways, and is also an expert in playing the flute. When he is first introduced to Sanjana, he seems to fall in love at first sight, or so it is made to appear at this point in the film. Initially a skeptical Sanjana rebukes Kishan's early attempts to prove that her husband is a lying cheat. This, however, only makes Kishan more determined. Kishan first attempts to bring all the girlfriends of Raj, Vikram and Yogi to one party, at the same time when all the wives are there as well, in order to force a surprise face-off, thus exposing the cheating husbands. But Raj, with the help of the others, manages to lie his way out of the situation convincingly. Frustrated, but now even more determined, Kishan hatches a new plan, to break the friendship of the three men, by portraying Yogi as a traitor. Raj and Vikram, initially embarrassed, now become suspicious that someone is helping their wives behind the scenes, in order to ruin their marriages. They decide at this point to seek professional help and look to hire a private detective to find out who it is. In a twist of fate, they end up at Kishan's office! However, Kishan pretends he has no idea who they are, and chooses to play a double game, agreeing to act as their detective while unknown to them being the very person working for their wives that they are looking for. Kishan now records Yogi talking to Sanjana in a park, hires a voice-over artist, and dubs the tape with Yogi now appearing  as if he is betraying Raj and Vikram's secrets to Sanjana. Kishan then shows this altered version to Raj and Vikram, making them to feel betrayed by Yogi. However, as fate has it, they get a chance for revenge right away when Yogi calls and confides in them that he is off to see Sweetie, one of his old girlfriends. Raj and Vikram are quick to reveal this information to Maya, as a result of which Yogi is caught red-handed by Maya, who goes ballistic at the site of Yogi in a hotel room with a girlfriend. Kishan also manages to get Raj, catching him standing in his bathrobe outside an apartment building window ledge due to his girlfriend's husband unexpectedly showing up at the door inside. Kishan calls in the news channel and the police in order to get the stranded Raj broadcast live on TV. He then calls Sanjana, asking her to turn on the TV and see for herself what Raj is up to. Caught red-handed, Raj asks Vikram for help, the later comes up with a ploy to make it appear that both Raj and Vikram are undercover police officers in real life. And as such, Raj was out on a mission when caught on camera and that the whole resulting ""cheating husband outside window"" scenario shown on TV was actually all a misunderstanding. The gullible Sanjana wholeheartedly buys into the story, much to Kishan's frustration. Kishan now hatches his own counter-plot and pretends to be the gangster don, King  who is supposedly out to kill Raj and Vikram, thinking they are indeed police officers. When Raj and Vikram come face to face with King, they quickly backtrack on their story of being undercover police officers. However, King  is able to scare Raj and Vikram into being blindfolded and taken as his prisoners. He then has them admitting, unknowingly in front of Sanjana and Shivani, that the whole secret agent thing is a fabrication and they have many girlfriends with whom they cheat on their wives regularly. Sanjana and Shivani become extremely upset upon hearing these confessions, the later fainting on the spot and Sanjana attempting suicide soon thereafter. Meanwhile, the double agent ruse has begun to wear thin after all this time. While at his office, Raj, Vikram and Yogi accidentally figure out that Kishan is, in fact, the person behind all the troubles they are in with their wives. When Kishan arrives, they quickly surround him with the intent to harm him, when all of a sudden Sanjana walks in. She is quick to defend Kishan, who had earlier saved her from committing suicide. At this point Raj threatens to divorce Sanjana, mistakenly assuming she is in love with Kishan. Sometime later, with the divorce finalized, Raj, Vikram and Yogi are found drunk at a lake-side restaurant, when Kishan appears all of a sudden. He has with him wedding cards inviting the three over to a wedding. Raj assumes its Kishan and Sanjana's wedding, and starts to chase after Kishan. Since he is drunk, he keeps missing and then accidentally smashes a police officer. The three friends are then arrested, and put in jail. Where they reminisce about the tragedy that has befallen them. But the next morning, they are bailed out by the don King, much to their surprise. Out of jail, and armed with a gun supplied by King, Raj, full of rage, heads straight for the wedding and straight away shoots Kishan, supposedly killing him on the spot. However, it turns out, the bullets were all fake blanks, planted by don in collaboration with Kishan himself. Kishan gets up and reveals that the wedding was actually supposed to be between Sanjana and the surprise groom, Raj himself, much to the embarrassment of Raj. It becomes clear at this point that Kishan was never after Sanjana herself as has been made to appear throughout the film. But that Kishan did all this because he himself once had a wife , who committed suicide after finding out that Kishan was cheating on her. From that day on, Kishan decided to become a private detective going around saving marriages in crisis, like his own. After this emotional revelation, Raj, Yogi and Vikram promise to give up outside-relationships. All the couples get back together, Raj and Sanjana get remarried."

During Travis' first class, his teacher talks about how Cooper and his church had their town ridiculed for his actions and beliefs. Later, Jared , a friend of Travis, reveals he received an invitation from a woman he met on a sex site for group sex with himself, Travis and Billy Ray . They borrow Travis' parent's car and travel out into the country to meet with the woman. Along the way, they accidentally sideswipe the vehicle of Sheriff Wynan , while he was engaged in a homosexual affair in his car. Afraid, the boys drive off. Sheriff Wynan returns to the station and tells his deputy Pete  to go and look for the vehicle. Meanwhile, the boys arrive at the trailer of the woman who sent out the invitation, Sarah Cooper . She encourages them to drink, and after being drugged by the beer, they pass out while undressing. Jared wakes up while being moved in a covered cage. He realizes he is in the sanctuary at Five Points after he identifies Cooper. Cooper begins a long, hate-filled sermon before identifying another captive, a homosexual they lured in through an internet chat room. They bind him to a cross using plastic cling wrap, execute him with a revolver and drop him into a small crawl space where Travis and Billy Ray are bound together. Cooper then begins binding Jared to the cross, but stops when he notices Pete driving up to the church. Travis and Billy Ray use a protruding bone from the corpse to cut themselves free, which is heard by Caleb . He lifts up the trap door just in time to see Billy Ray escape and runs after him. Billy Ray is not able to help Travis out of his tight cling wrap cuffs and leaves him for dead. Caleb chases Billy Ray into a room stocked with weapons, where the two end up shooting each other. Pete hears the gunshots and calls Wynan for back-up, but is shot and killed by Mordechai ([[James Parks . Cooper then blackmails Wynan, telling him to stay away or he will reveal Wynan's homosexuality to his wife using explicit photos the church has taken of him. In despair, Wynan calls ATF Agent Joseph Keenan , who begins setting up outside of the church. While the family mourns Caleb, Travis  arms himself and makes a run for it, eventually making it outside where he is shot and killed by Wynan, who mistook him for a member of the congregation. Keenan tries to reason with the family but a shoot-out erupts instead after ATF Special Agent Brooks  is shot in the head. In the midst of the shooting, Agent Keenan receives a call from ATF higher-ups ordering him to start a full raid of the complex to ensure that no witnesses remain of the operation to give details of the events. Another tactical agent named Harry  struggles with this decision and argues with Keenan in private against doing this. Keenan dismisses Harry's protests for personal reasons, rationalizing his decision based on personal gain and the reputation of the ATF, and Harry storms off in disgust. During the shoot-out, Cheyenne  escapes and is captured by an ATF agent  who is about to shoot her  but he is instead killed by Cheyenne's mother, Sarah. Cheyenne returns to the house and unbinds Jared, begging him to help her hide the congregation's children. Jared refuses due to the fact that the church had killed both his best friends, and her pleas turn into a fight. Sarah notices them and attacks Jared. Cheyenne tries to break up the fight and accidentally shoots Sarah in the process, killing her. Cheyenne sends the children up into the attic, and Jared changes his mind and decides to help Cheyenne hide the children. They run outside to plead with Keenan to spare the children but are killed by Harry, who has come around to accepting Keenan's rationales, though Keenan is now visibly disturbed by Harry's actions. The shoot-out is then suddenly interrupted when a mysterious loud trumpet blast echos across the sky. The remaining Coopers lower their weapons and run outside rejoicing, claiming that ""the Rapture"" has come upon them as the trumpet continues to play. Abin calmly approaches a stunned ATF team and confidently taunts them that God's wrath is upon the Earth. He raises his arms and stands in the face of a confused and worried Keenan in a moment of triumph, daring him to defy God as the trumpet blares. Several days later, during a briefing before high-ranking government officials, Keenan reports that he then head-butted Cooper and took the rest of the congregation into custody. He explains that the trumpet noises were not the Rapture but came from a group of marijuana farmers who lived down the road and were irritated with Cooper. As a prank they rigged up an old fire house siren to an iPod with loud trumpet noises, unaware of the shootout taking place over the hill. Keenan is promoted despite disobeying a direct order from his superiors at the time to kill everyone at the compound. Keenan is surprised that he is not punished for his insubordinate actions but his superiors explain that their initial decision to kill the members of the congregation was mostly personal and that they are satisfied with the alternative punishment of taking away the prisoners' constitutional rights to due process, locking them up without ever letting them go to trial. They also laugh at the irony that Cooper, who views homosexuality as an abomination, will more than likely be raped numerous times by his fellow male inmates. Keenan laments this outcome in a story he shares about a couple of hungry brawling dogs he once knew that taught him about the darker side of human nature and the way simple beliefs can turn humans into bloodthirsty animals. Cooper is finally seen pacing around his cell singing and sermoning to himself until another prisoner yells at him to ""Shut the fuck up!"" .  During various interactive Q&As for the film, Smith has stated that the original ending actually continued through with the trumpets signaling the Rapture. After Cooper tells Keenan to shoot him, Cooper's chest explodes, followed by the remaining family members' chests exploding one by one, and then the remaining agents' chests exploding one by one. During these deaths, the ground shakes and splits, and Keenan curls up on the ground and closes his eyes. When he opens his eyes he sees the last agent killed with a giant sword coming out of his chest, which is being wielded by an enormous armored angel. The angel looks at Keenan, puts a finger to his lips, and says ""shhhhh"". The angel then flies off into the sky, and as the angel banks out of the picture, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse descend.{{cite web}}"

While his friends Roosevelt  and Phillip  dine on simple bologna-and-cheese sandwiches for lunch, Donald is saddled with crab sandwiches and other cooking atrocities. To his horror, he discovers his wife has bought an unusually large Major Electric microwave oven, which makes the meals worse in half the time. After coming home drunk one night and getting into an argument with May, Donald loses his temper and bludgeons her to death with a large pepper grinder. He wakes up the next day with a bad hangover, no memory of the night before, and a growling stomach. He discovers May's corpse in the microwave and after the initial wave of horror passes, he starts to take it in stride, telling his co-workers that he and May separated. After work, he then cuts up May's body and stores it in foil wrap in the fridge. A running gag involving May's head retaining some sort of sentience is introduced during this scene. Looking for a midnight snack one night, Donald unintentionally takes a few bites of May's hand, and  after the initial wave of horror passes, he realizes it's the best thing he's ever eaten. He even brings some to work with him and shares it with Phillip and Roosevelt, who concur. He soon starts picking up hookers and using them for meat in his recipes. While cooking one night, Donald has a mild heart attack and goes to his doctor, who tells him of a pacemaker that was put in when he had some excess weight, but says he is fine overall. May's equally shrewish sister Evelyn  shows up, having not heard from her sister in some time. She finds her head, and is gagged with bread and thrown, tied up, in Donald's closet. Donald's lunches continue to be a hit with his friends, and he decides to cater an outing to a wrestling match with a new recipe he calls ""Peking chick."" When Roosevelt and Phillip show up to pick up Donald, they discover him dead on the floor of a heart attack, and some body parts in the microwave. They leave in horror and disgust, realizing what Donald had been serving them. Some time later, the house is up for sale and movers are taking the furniture out. A repairman examines the microwave and discovers a problem with the wires, commenting that it would be bad for someone with a pacemaker. We then zoom into the fridge, which opens to reveal May's head. Her eyes glow orange as the film ends."

The economy of the town is mostly agricultural, and the town is surrounded by vast cornfields. One particular year the corn crop fails and the people of Gatlin turn to prayer in an attempt to ensure a successful harvest. A mysterious boy preacher, Isaac Chroner ([[John Franklin , arrives and takes all the children of Gatlin into a cornfield to speak to them about the prophecies of a demon called ""He Who Walks Behind The Rows"". Isaac, through his lieutenant Malachai , leads the children of the town in a revolution, brutally killing all of the adults in the town. Over the ensuing years, the children take any adults passing through as sacrifices. Three years later, Burt  and his girlfriend Vicky  pass through Nebraska while driving cross-country to Burt's new job as a physician in Seattle, Washington. They are traveling in their car and hit a small boy out on the highway. This boy was one of the Gatlin children who tried to escape the iron hand of the death cult. The couple place his body in the trunk. They encounter an old mechanic, who is little to no help, as the children of Gatlin have employed him to lead all adults passing through to the town, but they betray him and kill him anyway. Burt and Vicky finally end up in Gatlin, after searching for several hours for a phone. A struggle ensues between the couple, ""He Who Walks Behind the Rows"" and the children as the couple are violently chased through the city. Burt and Vicky rescue Job and his little sister Sarah, who do not wish to be part of the cult. Vicky is captured by Malachai, and she is prepared as a sacrifice before they track down and capture Burt and the children. Meanwhile, Malachai and the others have grown tired of Isaac's arrogance. Assuming command over the children, Malachai orders Isaac to be sacrificed in Vicky's place. Night soon falls and Burt enters the cornfield to rescue Vicky. The sacrifice soon begins and Isaac is devoured by He Who Walks Behind The Rows. Burt arrives and battles Malachai, convincing the children that their minds have been poisoned and their humanity sacrificed in the name of their false god. As Malachai tries to regain control of the children, Isaac's re-animated corpse  appears and kills Malachai, breaking his neck. Soon, a terrible storm gathers over the cornfield and Burt and Vicky gather the children inside a barn to shield them from He Who Walks Behind The Rows' angry wrath. As the storm intensifies all around them, Job shows a Bible verse to Burt and Vicky that indicates that they must destroy the cornfield for the chaos to cease . While filling the irrigation pumps with gasohol fuel, He Who Walks Behind The Rows lashes out at Burt, preparing to destroy the barn. However, Burt is able to spray the fields with the flammable liquid and lights a Molotov cocktail, tossing it into the field, burning it and seemingly destroying the demon. Burt, Vicky, Job and Sarah survive and are able to leave Gatlin as the cornfields burn. As Burt grabs the map they used to get there, a teenage girl who is a member of the cult jumps out at him from the back seat and attempts to stab him. Vicky knocks her out with the passenger door, and the four walk off into the distance to parts unknown."

They celebrate with Terry's girlfriend, Candice, and his assistant, Denise. During the party, one of Terry's employees, Ray, welcomes Jarrod to L.A., thinking he has moved there to join Terry's special effects company. During a private argument about whether or not they should move, Elaine reveals she is pregnant. The next morning, blue lights descend from the sky, mesmerizing anyone who looks at them. The light affects them physically, causing them to become zombie-like. Any immobilized humans are collected by the machines. Ray is taken, but Jarrod is saved when Terry tackles him, and he quickly returns to normal. He and Terry go to the apartment roof investigate the lights. They see alien ships descending through the clouds and vacuuming up thousands of screaming people. Back in the apartment, Jarrod believes the open water would be a safer place, since there are no machines over the sea. They attempt to reach the marina by car, splitting into two cars: Terry and Denise in the first, followed by everyone else in the other. They encounter a couple, Colin and Jen, also getting ready to flee the building. As Terry's car exits the garage it is flattened by a massive alien. Denise is killed but Terry escapes. As he begins to run he is abducted. The others run back into the garage, where they encounter another lifeform that takes Colin. It corners the rest of the group before the building's concierge, Oliver, slams into it with an SUV. They find Colin is still alive inside the creature. As they try to free him, the machine comes to life, sucking out Colin's brain and regaining its energy. As they run back into the building, Jen is abducted. The next day, the United States Air Force launches an attack using stealth bombers and fighter aircraft armed with missiles. Only one stealth plane gets through and just before it gets destroyed it fires a nuclear missile, hitting the mothership. The detonation blows the ship apart, but as the mushroom cloud clears, the ship rises back into the air and begins to slowly repair itself. After Jarrod tells Elaine that the alien light made him feel powerful, he is adamant that safety must be found outside. Oliver wants to stay inside and tries restraining him. Jarrod physically starts changing as he lifts Oliver off the floor and vows that he will protect his family. Helicopters arrive, inserting squads of soldiers. Jarrod and Elaine go to the roof hoping to catch a ride to safety. Oliver and Candice stay in the penthouse, but are found. Candice is caught by the blue light and is absorbed; Oliver attempts to kill a tanker alien by turning on a gas stove and igniting a lighter, causing the room to explode. The soldiers are thrown off the roof by the aliens and a squid alien attacks Jarrod and Elaine. They kill it, but with Jarrod badly hurt. They are surrounded by the aliens, so resigned to their fate, they look into the blue light, embrace and are sucked up into the mother ship as it slowly flies over the building. A brief montage shows that cities all over the world have been overrun by the aliens. Inside the alien spacecraft, Elaine wakes up on a pile of human corpses. Tubes are sucking human brains into machines; probes go through the pile looking for what they can find. Elaine sees Jarrod in the pile but has to watch helplessly as his brain is removed. She is probed, but left alone since she is pregnant. Elaine is transported to another chamber where other pregnant women have been sent. Meanwhile, Jarrod's brain, glowing red instead of the usual aliens' blue, is inserted into a new alien body. Animating the alien body, Jarrod seems to retain control, and comes to the aid of Elaine and their unborn child. A series of still images depict ""Jarrod"" protecting Elaine and their child from other aliens. Eventually ""Jarrod"" defeats them, picks his girlfriend up, and runs off with her."

Despite the affair, Eun-yi is still warm and friendly to Hoon's oblivious wife, Hae-ra; she even expresses enthusiasm and delight at the progress of Hae-ra's pregnancy. Byeong-sik, aka ""Miss Cho""  witnesses Eun-yi and Hoon having sex. She tries to subtly pry details from Eun-yi, but Eun-yi brushes her off casually. Later, Miss Cho reveals her suspicion to Hae-ra's mother that Eun-yi is pregnant. Hae-ra's mother then visits the family and stages an ""accident,"" resulting in Eun-yi falling from a ladder positioned at the top of a set of stairs. Dangling from a chandelier, Eun-yi begs Hae-ra's mother to pull her over the railing. Hae-ra's mother doesn't oblige, and Eun-yi falls. Suffering only a concussion, Eun-yi spends the night in the hospital. During her stay, she learns that she is pregnant and contemplates abortion. Meanwhile, the affair is revealed to Hae-ra. Hae-ra's mother, Mi-hee, instructs Hae-ra to ignore the affair; she insists that all wealthy husbands will eventually cheat and that if Hae-ra ignores it she can ""live like a queen."" Later that night, Hae-ra stands over Eun-yi's bed with a golf club but is unable to strike the sleeping woman. The next day, Hae-ra and her mother confront Eun-yi, offering her $100,000 to have an abortion and leave. Hae-ra knows that Eun-yi wouldn't abort her child ""for all the money in the world,"" so she takes matters into her own hands by poisoning the herbal medicine packets Eun-yi drinks every day. Hae-ra goes to the hospital and delivers her twin sons. Hoon visits the hospital, where Hae-ra makes her ill-will toward him known. Furious, he returns home alone and finds Eun-yi in his bathtub. She reveals that she is pregnant and plans on keeping the baby. Eun-yi succumbs to the effects of the poison, and Mi-hee arranges an abortion without Eun-yi's consent. After the abortion, Miss Cho reveals that she told Mi-hee about Eun-yi's pregnancy. Eun-yi is angry, but forgives Miss Cho and vows to get revenge on the family. After recovering from her abortion, Eun-yi sneaks into the house with Miss Cho's assistance. Hoon finds her breastfeeding one of the newborn babies. Hae-ra insists that Miss Cho chase Eun-yi out of the house, but Miss Cho refuses and quits her job on the spot. Eun-yi then confronts the entire family , hanging herself from the same chandelier she once clung to, then lighting her body on fire as the family watches in horror."

A French antiques dealer, whose name is never given , attends the talk with her 11-year-old son in order to have Miller sign the copies she has bought of the book, but has to leave early because her son is hungry. She drops off her phone number with Miller's translator. Miller and the woman then meet at her shop, and Miller suggests they get out and see some of the countryside. The woman drives them around aimlessly while Miller signs the books, and they talk about the book's subject. They then visit a museum, and the woman gets increasingly distraught as she complains about her rebellious son and Miller seems to defend her son's behavior. They then go to a cafe. Miller steps out to take a phone call, and the woman who runs the cafe, thinking Miller is the woman's husband, gets into a conversation with the woman about marriage and about him specifically. After Miller returns and the two leave the cafe, the nature of their discussion changes: they start to speak in a combination of French and English instead of just English , and, more unexpectedly, they now speak as if they truly are a married couple, who have been married for 15 years, and the son is both of theirs. It is left unclear which, if either, is the true reality of the film."

Melancholia, a blue gas giantMelancholia: when worlds collide, beautifully that had formerly been hidden behind the sun, becomes visible in the sky, approaching Earth. John is excited about the planet, and looks forward to the ""fly-by"" expected by scientists, who have assured the public that Earth and Melancholia will pass each other without colliding.  Claire is very fearful that the end of the world is imminent, despite her husband's assertions that their family is safe. She searches the Internet and finds a site describing the movements of the planet Melancholia around Earth as a ""dance of death"" in which the apparent passage of Melancholia initiates a slingshot orbit that will bring the planets into collision soon thereafter. Justine tells Claire that life on Earth is evil, and that Melancholia will hit. Justine further informs her sister that her intuition tells her that Earth is the only planet in the universe with life, and that the destruction of Earth will mean the end of all life. On the night of the fly-by, it seems that Melancholia will not hit Earth. John, Justine, and Claire watch Melancholia rise on the night of the flyby and view it through a telescope. After the fly-by, background birdsong abruptly ceases. The next day, Claire realizes that Melancholia is circling back and will collide with Earth after all. John, who has come to the same realization, commits suicide. Claire finds his body and then tries to conceal his death from Leo and Justine. Faced with the impending collision, Claire becomes distraught and suggests a ""farewell party"" on the terrace with wine and music. In response, Justine, unfazed by the impending doom, demeans Claire's idea before going to comfort Leo. She makes him a protective ""magic cave"", a teepee of wooden sticks, on the lawn of the estate. Justine, Claire and Leo enter the shelter as the planet approaches. Claire continues to remain agitated and fearful, while Justine and Leo remain calm and hold hands. Melancholia collides with Earth."

While flying a plane through the hurricane, their generator malfunctions, and they lose contact with it. While trying to fix this problem, a lightning bolt hits the plane causing all systems to fail, and the plane crashes into the Atlantic Ocean. Shortly after this, a group of storm trackers realize that the category 5 hurricane is heading straight for their weather station in Miami, and are forced to evacuate. The film skips forward to present day, where meteorologist Dr. Ron Young is teaching a class of college students at the University of Miami about hurricanes. After the class is over, he and his older brother are working on a device called ""Maytag"", that will enable them to control a storms direction. While Young is at his lab, Tom Holt who works for Zepher Weather Dynamics, explains to him that his company is fascinated with his ""storm-moving"" abilities. He gives Young a job as a storm tracker at Zepher Weather Dynamics in Hollywood, California. At the weather center, Young meets General Roberts, and scientist Dr. Platt, who explain to Young that they have created a device similar to the ""Maytag"", known as ""the Ion Generator"". Roberts explains that they plan to use the device to move storms into Mexico where it will bring much needed rainfall. Meanwhile, Roberts is tracking Hurricane Elizabeth in the Pacific Ocean, which is heading toward Los Angeles. A group of the storm chasers including the pilot, ""Dr. Platt"", fail their mission when Platt is shot and killed on the airplane by one of the other storm trackers on board. Seeking revenge on the man who killed Platt, another storm tracker on board the airplane ignites the trail of blood from Platt using a cigarette lighter, which causes the plane to explode. Following the failed mission, Roberts requests that Holt, Young, and pilot major Tanya Goodman, to fly into the hurricane and redirect it toward Mexico. During this, Los Angeles is being evacuated due to the predicted landfall of Hurricane Elizabeth. After hearing about this, Andrea Mackintire, a reporter from KLAZ, as well as several other reporters decide to go out in the storm to cover the hurricane, which is now a massive category 5 hurricane with winds over 400&nbsp;mph, and they barely make it back to headquarters alive. Back on the plane, Young attempts to send the hurricane out to sea. Holt refuses to allow this, and threatens to shoot Young, before Young throws Holt off the plane causing him to fall to his death. After this, Goodman reveals that she was on Holt's side, planning to send the hurricane back to Mexico.

Hunt is annoyed to learn that Smiley, who has a weakness for women, lost the proceeds from the latest robbery when he met a ""dame"". He soon finds a new target for his larceny in the aged, blind Baron de Jonghe , a longtime hotel resident with an unsuspected cache of stolen money. He sets out to determine its hiding place by romancing Camille , de Jonghe's attentive, inexperienced relative. When Smiley falls for Eliza Mowbray , however, he blabs to her his boss's plan. Soon, every one of the motley assortment of fugitive criminals and murderers who inhabit the hotel knows, and Hunt is forced to promise each a share of the loot. To complicate matters even further, Hunt falls in love with Camille, and she with him. The location of the money is revealed when the baron becomes extremely agitated when Hunt offers to start a fire in his in-suite fireplace. Hunt keeps this discovery to himself, but tells Smiley to borrow the key to Eliza's car. The crooks, having grown impatient with Hunt's leisurely courtship of Camille, demand action. Hunt suggests privately to pairs of criminals that the money would be better divided amongst three partners. They all agree. Meanwhile, Alfred , the baron's brother, arrives with a promise of amnesty if de Jonghe will return the money he stole. De Jonghe insists it is legitimately his, and that Camille is to have it after he is gone. Later, after de Jonghe leaves to enjoy holiday festivities, Hunt sneaks in, searches the chimney and locates the money. He pockets the loot and puts the metal box back where he found it, then slips away. De Jonghe becomes suspicious and returns to his room. As he is retrieving the box, he is seen by one of the crooks, who shoots him dead and flees with the box, unaware it is empty. The sound of the gunshot rouses the rest of the residents. It does not take long for them to realize that Hunt has double crossed them all. However, while Smiley holds them off with his gun, Hunt gives Camille the money and sends her to safety with Alfred de Jonghe. He tells the tearful young woman that this is the first good thing he has ever done and that she will be better off if she is not found in the company of a wanted fugitive. Then, he and Smiley make good their own escape. As they are driving off, Smiley asks about his share of the money. Hunt presents him with a flower, explaining that he met a ""dame""."

It's the day before Christmas Eve, and Ranger Dan receives a call that all the trees in the forest are disappearing. Tommy and Julie are concerned, but Dan tells them that he'll get to the bottom of this. That night, Tommy, Julie, and Schaeffer go to sleep and start to dream of playing in the snow. Meanwhile, in another part of the forest, a trio of raccoons  prepare their home, The Raccoondominium, for Christmas. Suddenly, Ralph reads in the paper that all the trees in the forest are disappearing, and he and Melissa worry that their home is next. Not too far away from the Raccoondominium, local aardvark millionaire Cyril Sneer is revealed to be the tree thief. His plan is to cut down every tree in the forest and make a profit out of the lumber. His college-educated son Cedric tries to talk him out of his crazed plans to destroy the whole forest, reasoning that they already have enough trees. Cyril ignores Cedric and chops down a whole line of trees, including the Raccoondominium. However, Cyril loses the Raccoons' tree and Tommy, Julie, and Schaeffer find it and take it home. Left without a home, the Raccoons try to find who's behind the destruction of the forest. Ralph sees the kids and Schaeffer dragging it to the cabin and deduces that they are the ones responsible for stealing all the trees and they follow the kids to get their home back. Tommy and Julie go to town to collect presents for their dad, leaving Schaeffer alone in the cabin. The Raccoons make their way inside where they find the Raccoondominium decorated with ornaments, tinsel, and lights. As Melissa tries to get their Christmas stockings back, Schaeffer wakes up from his nap and chases the Raccoons through the forest. The chase leads the four animals to Cyril's lumber headquarters, where Schaeffer finds out the truth about his family's Christmas tree, as do the Raccoons about his innocence. The animals then team up to plan to catch the real tree thief. As Cyril and Cedric head out to cut down the rest of the trees in the forest, the Raccoons and Schaeffer catch the two Sneers. After some convincing that there's a profit in planting trees, Cyril eventually promises to replant all of the trees. Schaeffer hears the kids calling for him in the distance and he and the Raccoons leave in triumph. The animals are pleased that they have saved the forest, but the Raccoons are upset that they are left without a home. The four walk back to the cabin, wish each other a Merry Christmas, and Schaeffer returns to the cabin, where Julie and Tommy wait for him. Just then, Julie and Tommy see the homeless Raccoons in the cold and realize that their Christmas tree must be the Raccoons' home. Julie phones their father to ask him to find a new home for them. Dan agrees and the group celebrate. The next day, the kids rush to open their presents, but are surprised that it's only Christmas Eve and they must have dreamt the events of the previous 'day'. However, Dan tells the kids that the trees have miraculously stopped being cut down. He reads a newspaper article to them which says that thousands of seedlings were planted overnight, but the identity of the one responsible is unknown. Suddenly, Schaeffer alerts the kids to the window again and they can see the Raccoons and a new re-planted tree not far from the cabin. The Raccoons wave goodbye to the kids and Schaeffer and climb into the tree to settle into a new home.

Each family represents a different slice of early 1980s middle-class society. Kannan and Uma are a working couple. Kannan's father, retired from Government service, lives with them. They enjoy the comforts of dual income, but their general lament is that their long work hours compel them to send their five year old daughter Priya to boarding school. The second couple comprises real estate agent Paramasivam and his homemaker wife Parvathi. Real estate in the early 1980s is not very profitable or progressive. Paramasivam and Parvathi enjoy a happy marriage, but Paramasivam's limited  income is barely able to meet household costs. The third couple is Srinivasa Raghavan and Lakshmiammal. Fifty-five year old Srinivasa Raghavan is a worthless wastrel. In spite of a college education, he has never worked a day in his life. He chooses to roam about the city and engage in pointless banter with anyone he can find. Lakshmiammal works as a cook to earn a meager wage, but they frequently have to pawn their valuables to get by. Their son Madhu is an aspiring actor with dreams of making it big, and their daughter Mythili is still in high school. Their everyday lives have ups and downs. Kannan and Uma work all through the week. Uma takes German lessons in the evenings. Their overburdened schedule permits them to see their daughter only on weekends, and as a result they gradually drift away from the needs of their child. As for Paramasivam, his income is squeezed by the down market or by crafty tenants . Lakshmiammal works long hours in hot kitchens, and worries that her declining health might just give out one day. There are some new arrivals. The first is Parvathi's brother Kumar. Kumar has recently graduated from college, and he arrives in Chennai to start a new job. He plans to stay with Parvathi for a few days until he finds a new place. The second arrival is Anandan, a mild-mannered young man. He used to work at a rice mill in Nagapatnam, but when the mill was destroyed in a cyclone, his employer transferred him to another job in Chennai. Anandan is happy to find another job, but despairs because he is away from his wife and children in Nagapatnam. He is not able to afford weekly trips to see his family. Lakshmiammal recognizes an opportunity and proposes a boarding arrangement. Anandan is happy to accept; Lakshmiammal's home cooked food is healthier and cheaper than eating out every day. The families are faced with various crises. Kannan's father discovers that Lakshmiammal has been visiting a hospital to treat an emerging tuberculosis ailment caused by long exposure to cooking flames. Kannan's father discreetly informs Mythili that Lakshmiammal must not continue working. Mythili drops out of school and starts working at a palatial mansion in the city.  The job, however, pays quite well and Mythili anonymously sends a portion of the money to her mother. Srinivasa Raghavan remains oblivious or apathetic to the whole situation. Kannan and Paramasivam are also faced with trouble. Uma receives a promotion at work. Kannan is unable to accept that his wife makes more money. Priya continues to drift away from her parents, and refuses to come home for Diwali. When Parvathi suddenly becomes pregnant, she is forced to abort because of their strained financial situation. Paramasivam is stricken cold by the fact that he did not have cash for the cab to bring his wife to the hospital. Uma, Parvathi and Lakshmiammal individually ponder the central questions of the film &mdash; the role of money and the role of working women in the new society order. Their troubles escalate. Kannan dreams that Uma is seduced by her German boss, and that she will eventually leave him. Paramasivam is compelled to borrow money, at exorbitant interest, from a loan shark. Parvathi is deeply grieved to learn this. Lakshmiammal follows Mythili and assumes the worst when she sees that a car is sent to fetch Mythili every day. She breaks down in tears before Srinivasa Raghavan. When Srinivasa Raghavan angrily question Mythili, she retorts that he, having never provided for the family, has no fatherly rights to ask about her business. The men set about evaluating their situation. Kannan and Uma decide that their child is a higher priority than additional income, and Uma accordingly resigns from her job. Kannan's father provides additional support by way of his retirement income. Paramasivam finally agrees to let Parvathi get a real job. And Srinivasa Raghavan, stung by his daughter's criticism, sets off to find work. Undaunted by rejection from various offices, he finally earns a day's wages by working on the docks. He returns home with dignity. Now that he has restored his station as a father, he claims the right to question Mythili. He bluntly asks if she has been prostituting herself. Mythili takes him to the palatial mansion. She reveals that the lady of the house has been stricken with a paralysing disease and that Mythili's job is to help her with her daily duties.

Gil is struggling to finish his first novel, centered around a man who works in a nostalgia shop, but Inez dismisses his ambition as a romantic daydream and encourages him to stick with the more lucrative screenwriting. While Gil is considering moving to Paris , Inez is intent on living in Malibu. By chance, they are joined by Inez's friend Paul, a pedantic pseudo-intellectual who speaks with great authority but questionable accuracy on the history and art of the city. Inez admires him, but Gil finds him insufferable. One night, Gil gets drunk and becomes lost in the back streets of Paris. At midnight, a 1920s Peugeot Type 176 car draws up beside him, and the passengers&mdash;dressed in 1920s clothing&mdash;urge him to join them. They go to a party for Jean Cocteau where Gil comes to realize that he has been transported back to the 1920s, an era he idolizes. He encounters Alice B. Toklas, Cole Porter, Josephine Baker, Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald, who take him to meet Ernest Hemingway. Hemingway agrees to show Gil's novel to Gertrude Stein, and Gil goes to fetch his manuscript from his hotel. However, as soon as he leaves, he finds he has returned to 2010 and the bar has disappeared. Gil attempts to bring Inez to the past with him the following night, but while they wait, she becomes impatient, and peevishly returns to the hotel. Just after she leaves, the clock strikes midnight and the same car arrives, this time with Hemingway inside it. He takes Gil to meet Stein, who agrees to read his novel and introduces him to Pablo Picasso and his mistress Adriana, to whom Gil is instantly attracted. Stein reads aloud the novel's first line:{{cite web}} :{{cquote}} Adriana says that she is hooked by these few lines and has always had a longing for the past. Gil spends each of the next few nights in the past. His late-night wanderings annoy Inez, and arouse the suspicion of her father, who hires a detective to follow Gil. Meanwhile, Gil spends more and more time with Adriana, who leaves Picasso for a brief dalliance with Hemingway. Gil realizes he is falling in love with her, leaving him in conflict. He confides his predicament to Salvador Dalí, Man Ray, and Luis Buñuel, but being surrealists they see nothing strange about his claim to have come from the future, finding it to be perfectly normal. They discuss the impossibility of Gil's relationship with Adriana, and each of the artists envisages a different masterpiece inspired by such an unusual romance. While Inez shops for furniture, Gil meets Gabrielle, an antiques dealer and fellow admirer of the Lost Generation. Gil later discovers Adriana's diary from the 1920s on a book stall by the Seine and discovers that she was in love with him. Reading that she dreamed of receiving a gift of earrings from him and then making love to him, Gil attempts to steal a pair of earrings from Inez to give to Adriana, but is thwarted by Inez's early return from a trip. Gil purchases earrings for Adriana and, returning to the past, declares his love for her. As they kiss, they are invited inside a horse-drawn carriage by a richly-dressed couple and are transported back to the 1890s Belle Époque, an era Adriana considers Paris's Golden Age. They are taken to Maxim's Paris, and eventually to the Moulin Rouge where they meet Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Paul Gauguin, and Edgar Degas. When Gil asks what they thought the best era was, the three determine that the greatest era was the Renaissance. The enthralled Adriana is offered a job designing ballet costumes, and proposes to Gil that they stay. Gil, however, realizes that despite the allure of nostalgia, it is better to accept the present for what it is. Adriana elects to stay in the 1890s, and they part. Gil retrieves his novel from Stein, who praises his progress as a writer but questions why the main character has not realized that his fiancée  is having an affair with a pedantic character . Gil returns to 2010 and confronts Inez. She admits to sleeping with Paul, but dismisses it as a meaningless fling. Inez's parents agree with Gil when he tells her that they are not right for each other, prompting Inez's father to confess that he had Gil followed, though the detective mysteriously disappeared.  Gil breaks up with Inez and decides to remain in Paris. Taking a walk at midnight, he meets Gabrielle and, after it starts to rain, offers to walk her home and learns that she shares his love of Paris in the rain.

As often occurred in those times, government officials fanning out across the nation seeking young candidates for centralized training arrive at this school. At first bypassed but selected after a plea by his teacher during the school visit, Li seems bewildered although piqued by the gruff preliminary inspection screening at the provincial capital city of Qingdao. Forwarded to a Beijing audition for a place in Madame Mao's Dance Academy, he is admitted for ballet training based on a series of physique and flexibility examinations. Years of arduous training follow, Li surpassing his initial lukewarm interest and mediocre performance after inspiration from senior teacher Chan . Later during the course of a groundbreaking cultural visit to China, American-based English ballet director Ben Stevenson, impressed by Li's standout talent, seeks him as an exchange student at his the Houston Ballet. Li's determined courage garners a formerly disparaging teacher to influence the Academy allow him the opportunity for a three-month stay in the United States. Li's encounters with US life cause questioning of the Chinese Communist Party dictates upon which he has been raised, and he begins a relationship with an aspiring American dancer, Elizabeth Mackey. Quickly attracting the attention of the local ballet scene, Li together with Stevenson requests a time extension in America, but the Chinese government refuses. Overwhelmed by the opportunities offered in America and in love with Mackey, Li is determined to stay. With legal advice that the Chinese government would recognize certain residence rights arising from an international marriage, Li and Mackey rush into a marriage. To declare personal responsibility for his decision and hopefully avoid consequences for his family and Stevenson, Li visits the Chinese Consulate in Houston. The Chinese resident diplomat forcibly detains Li in attempt to coerce his return to China. Unknown to Li, the situation quickly evolves when the media and high level government agents both in the US and China become involved. When Li perseveres in his refusal to repatriate, the Chinese Government agrees to release him but revokes his citizenship and declares he can never return to the land of his birth. Li and Elizabeth are set to depart for Florida but Li is persuaded to stay by Stevenson for his ballet company, dooming Elizabeth's prospects of dancing success. Burdened by this, plus concerned for and unable to communicate with his family, Cunxin continues to excel at dance, but his relationship with Elizabeth disintegrates and their marriage ends. Five years later, as a show of goodwill the Chinese government allows Li's parents to visit him in the US where they finally witness his performance of the The Rite of Spring and even reunite with him on stage. Li is eventually granted permission to visit China. Together with his new wife Mary McKendry , an Australian ballerina, and coming back to the village of his youth, he rejoins family and the former teacher Chan. Li and McKendry give an impromptu outdoor ballet performance with his wife to the village's uproarious cheer. Closing credits announce that: Li Cunxin danced in China with the Houston Ballet in 1995, a performance broadcast to an audience of over 500 million people. He and Mary McKendry now live in Australia with their three children. Ben Stevenson left the Houston Ballet after 27 years as Artistic Director. Acclaimed as one of the world’s leading choreographers, he is now Artistic Director of the Texas Ballet Theater. Charles C. Foster still practices law in Houston. He is recognized internationally as an authority on Immigration Law. Elizabeth Mackey  danced with the Oklahoma Ballet for some years. She is now a speech therapist, working mainly with children.

Sally finds him there and apologizes. She then takes him back to her place and tucks him in a cot beneath her bed. For Valentine's Day, the two go out to dinner and Sally asks him to have sex with her, after inquiring that he had never done it. George, clearly shocked, doesn't answer.

Due to insufficient funds, he is unable to fulfill his dream. On the other hand his girlfriend Tani  got a scholarship to US. Though, he is happy for his girlfriend's achievement, he becomes depressed for not fulfilling his own dream. His friend, Ricky , tells him that he can get him into the college, but Lorry will have to smuggle drugs along with him. Lorry agrees and at the airport, successfully passes the X-ray machine. ACP Vishnu Kamath  is a previously corrupt cop who had accepted a lot of bribes to satisfy his family. However, his family died in a car accident. Several years later, he is offered a job by the Chief Minister of Goa: to flush out all the drug gangsters in Goa, which he accepts. His success leads to a panic among the drug suppliers. The drug dealers gather for a meeting led by Zoey . Zoey guarantees them that their drugs will be in safe hands if they are given to a mysterious person named Michael Barbosa. Kamath decides to chase Michael Barbosa and finds out about Ricky. When Kamath reaches Ricky, he is already dead. Kamath finds out about his cocaine-smuggling and his girlfriend, Rozanna . They reach the airport on the same day Lorry is about to leave. Kamath encounters Rozanna and finds a photo of Lorry in her phone. She is allowed to go due to lack of evidence. Kamath then identifies Lorry as the person he had seen in Rozanna's phone. They detain him and find cocaine stuffed in his bag. Lorry is sent to juvenile jail, where his friend, DJ Joki , tries to get him out. It is then revealed that Zoey and Joki used to date. Zoey wanted to be an air hostess, but failed. Joki introduced her to his boss, Lorsa Biscuta a.k.a. the Biscuit , who had worldwide contacts. With the help of his contacts, Biscuit got her an international job in airlines, though she had to smuggle cocaine to international regions to repay him. She ended up getting caught and was sentenced to 14 years in jail. Biscuit's contact got her free in 14 days, but to repay him, she had to sleep with Biscuit. She broke up with Joki and led her life into drug-dealing with Biscuit. Joki meets Zoey and the two end up sleeping together. Zoey gives him a video of Biscuit announcing that he is going to give a rave in neighboring Karnataka, out of Kamath's jurisdiction and that Michael Barbosa will be bringing and exchanging drugs. Joki gives this tape to Kamath. When Biscuit comes to know about Zoey and Joki, he kills Zoey. After recruiting Lorry for help, Kamath attacks Biscuit's party and arrests the drug dealers. Kamath's teammate Rane asks him about Barbosa, Kamath says that he knows the mystery of Barbosa and Rane kills Kamath. It is revealed that Rane was always involved with Biscuit. Joki later finds out about Kamath's death and arrives at the crime scene, fitting together the pieces as Kamath has. Michael Barbosa is not a man but a gravesite Biscuit uses for storing drugs. We see Joki carefully storing the bags of cocaine somewhere, then calling Rane to arrange a meeting. Lorry is now free of the charge and he comes out of jail. Then when Joki and Rane are going to meet Biscuit, Joki kills Rane saying that he knows Rane is the person who kills Kamath. Then Kamath's body is being cremated in an electric furnace owned by Biscuit. We see that this is where Joki has put the drugs, and Biscuit arrives just too late. Having been brought low by the destruction of his stockpile, Biscuit is killed by a woman who may be Rozanna. Lorry comes to a beach party where Joki is singing, and Tani joins him in a joyful reunion. The film ends with Joki is riding on his bike envisioning Kamath and Zoey.

He has come back from a session with Dr. Freud in Vienna that has left him distraught. Left to have her baby alone, the witty and beautiful Alma enlists the help of her sister’s husband – also a psychiatrist - the dispassionate, repressed Salvador, to help her solve the mystery of Leon’s sudden departure. Ignoring his better judgment, Salvador agrees to help her, even though he sees it could be trouble for him with his prim, frigid wife, Olivia, Alma’s sister. There is a sibling rivalry between Alma and Olivia that is shared by their husbands. Olivia is jealous of her feminist sister as the favorite of their father, Dr. Mira, the pompous chief of staff in the hospital where both Leon and Salvador have their practice. Helping her father, Alma serves as translator in a lecture by Dr. Alois Alzheimer – who is unable to remember anything. The beautiful Alma is as free-spirited as Salvador is uptight. Helping her, Salvador quickly runs into trouble. After an accidental self-hypnosis, he confesses that he is deeply in love with Alma, and that he married her sister, the ostensibly sexually inhibited Olivia, only to be near her. Still under hypnosis, traumatized by comments made by his wife regarding the size of his member, he exposes himself in a public place and his father-in-law fires him from his job. A trail of clues initially indicates that Leon’s disappearance may be connected to the concealment of embarrassing revelations about the sex life of the King of Spain, Alfonso XIII. Hints also led them to the back room of a barn that serves as a hide-out for making pornographic films. They also visit a deranged woman in a mad-house, a cross-dressing club and a high-class bordello, led all the while by clues contained in Leon’s thesis: a detailed journal of his psychoanalytic sessions with four women he is treating for “hysteria”: a psychotic woman who tried to murder her husband; an actress with a persecution complex; a woman with a serious crisis concerning her sexual identity; and a stranger who has discovered a terrible secret about her past. Salvador and Alma's investigation reveals a series of outrageous secrets. These include that Olivia has been living a secret life, going to a transvestite club. She has a lesbian lover and plans to leave her husband. Alma’s alcoholic housekeeper, the unsympathetic Senora Mingarro, turns out to be Leo’s biological mother, the result of a torrid affair with Dr. Mira, which makes Alma and Leon's marriage an incestuous union. The sudden reappearance of Leon only complicates things further. Eventually they all attend a distinguished gathering in honor of Dr. Freud, who has come to Barcelona to discourse on his new book, “Totem and Taboo.” Since Leon attributes all of his problems to Dr. Freud's theories on sexuality, he plans to kill him. However, the fall of a big chandelier aborts the assassination attempt. Leon and Dr. Mira die as a result of the accident with the chandelier.

He has come back from a session with Dr. Freud in Vienna that has left him distraught. Left to have her baby alone, the witty and beautiful Alma enlists the help of her sister’s husband – also a psychiatrist - the dispassionate, repressed Salvador, to help her solve the mystery of Leon’s sudden departure. Ignoring his better judgment, Salvador agrees to help her, even though he sees it could be trouble for him with his prim, frigid wife, Olivia, Alma’s sister. There is a sibling rivalry between Alma and Olivia that is shared by their husbands. Olivia is jealous of her feminist sister as the favorite of their father, Dr. Mira, the pompous chief of staff in the hospital where both Leon and Salvador have their practice. Helping her father, Alma serves as translator in a lecture by Dr. Alois Alzheimer – who is unable to remember anything. The beautiful Alma is as free-spirited as Salvador is uptight. Helping her, Salvador quickly runs into trouble. After an accidental self-hypnosis, he confesses that he is deeply in love with Alma, and that he married her sister, the ostensibly sexually inhibited Olivia, only to be near her. Still under hypnosis, traumatized by comments made by his wife regarding the size of his member, he exposes himself in a public place and his father-in-law fires him from his job. A trail of clues initially indicates that Leon’s disappearance may be connected to the concealment of embarrassing revelations about the sex life of the King of Spain, Alfonso XIII. Hints also led them to the back room of a barn that serves as a hide-out for making pornographic films. They also visit a deranged woman in a mad-house, a cross-dressing club and a high-class bordello, led all the while by clues contained in Leon’s thesis: a detailed journal of his psychoanalytic sessions with four women he is treating for “hysteria”: a psychotic woman who tried to murder her husband; an actress with a persecution complex; a woman with a serious crisis concerning her sexual identity; and a stranger who has discovered a terrible secret about her past. Salvador and Alma's investigation reveals a series of outrageous secrets. These include that Olivia has been living a secret life, going to a transvestite club. She has a lesbian lover and plans to leave her husband. Alma’s alcoholic housekeeper, the unsympathetic Senora Mingarro, turns out to be Leo’s biological mother, the result of a torrid affair with Dr. Mira, which makes Alma and Leon's marriage an incestuous union. The sudden reappearance of Leon only complicates things further. Eventually they all attend a distinguished gathering in honor of Dr. Freud, who has come to Barcelona to discourse on his new book, “Totem and Taboo.” Since Leon attributes all of his problems to Dr. Freud's theories on sexuality, he plans to kill him. However, the fall of a big chandelier aborts the assassination attempt. Leon and Dr. Mira die as a result of the accident with the chandelier. Olivia leaves for Paris where she wants to have a freer life with her lesbian lover. Alma gives birth to a baby boy. She realizes that she has fallen in love with Salvador and they become a happy couple.

Paint has been sprayed over the word ""Hope"" on the town's welcome sign, changing it to read ""Scum Town"". Scum Town is ruled with an iron fist by a crime lord known as ""The Drake"" ([[Brian Downey  and his sadistic, murderous sons Ivan  and Slick ([[Gregory Smith . Just as he arrives, the Hobo witnesses an amateur film maker  shooting what is commonly known as ""Bum Fight"" movies. While pushing his shopping cart of recyclables through the streets, he sees, along with all the townspeople gathered in the area, a distressed, bloodied man screaming about being chained and unsuccessfully begging the locals, including the Hobo, to free his tied hands so he can save his life. The man is in a suit and appears to be in a stockade that resembles a manhole cover. Two cars approach the man, one driven by Ivan and Slick and the other The Drake and an Asian woman. An argument ensues and it is revealed that the man is The Drake's younger brother, Logan . The Drake explains to the townspeople that his brother will serve as an example of his control and carries out the public execution of Logan, who is decapitated at the hands of Ivan and Slick, by a barbed-wire noose attached to The Drake's truck, as the woman dances ecstatically in the fountain of Logan's blood. Later, while walking through the town the Hobo passes a pawn shop, where he sees a lawnmower in the window costing $49.99. In order to purchase the lawnmower, for reasons yet to be revealed, the Hobo starts begging for change on a sidewalk. From where he sits, the Hobo can see what appears to be a night club with The Drake's face and name on the outside. A group of punks drag another homeless man into the club against his will. The Hobo then sees Ivan and Slick enter the building. He follows them into the building, which appears to be a demented arcade. Ivan and Slick, along with their henchmen, are seen torturing and killing people for no reason. Slick begins harassing a boy named Otis , who owes him money from drug purchases. Then a prostitute named Abby  attempts to intervene, disrespecting Slick. Slick becomes enraged with the hooker and Ivan breaks Otis' arm on the video game. Slick then throws down a pile of cocaine and all the patrons fight over themselves to get to it. Slick propositions the hooker, gets her outside, then instead decides to kill her. Having seen all that has transpired, the Hobo stands up to Slick, who him attacks but is knocked unconscious by the Hobo and taken to the police station in order to turn him in. While initially agreeing with the despicable state of the town under the thumb of The Drake, the police chief  reveals his corruption and allegiance to the criminal elements. Ivan enters the interrogation room and he and the chief tackle and restrain the Hobo. Slick then enters, joining Ivan in roughing up the Hobo and carving the word ""scum"" into his chest. The Hobo is then thrown into a garbage bin by the police chief and a fellow officer. The Hobo stumbles across Abby as she is trying to conduct business and frightens away her John. Seeing the state he is in, Abby takes the Hobo to her apartment to tend to his wounds. The next day, the Hobo goes to the amateur filmmaker seen earlier to make money to buy the lawnmower. Upon completing a series of degrading acts, including chewing glass, he earns enough money to purchase the lawnmower. As he is about to buy the lawnmower, a trio of robbers enter the pawnshop, taking a woman and her baby hostage. The Hobo grabs a shotgun from the shelf and kills the three bandits. Realizing that Hope Town needs justice, he chooses the Shotgun over the lawnmower, since they both cost exactly $49.99. He pays for the gun and goes on a rampage in which he murders dozens of criminals, including the filmmaker, a pimp , a coke lord  and a pedophile dressed as Santa Claus . The Drake, infuriated by the positive effect that the Hobo's actions are having on the townspeople, instructs Ivan and Slick to get rid of him. After using a flamethrower on a school bus filled with children to remind the citizens of Hope Town that they are to be feared, they burst into a television station during a live news broadcast, kill the anchor  and demand that all homeless people be killed. This leads to the formation of mobs which start murdering the vagrants of Hope Town. The Hobo, in an attempt to save Abby, uses his shotgun to blow off the head of a perverted cop  who was trying to rape her. One of the murderous mobs hears the attack and head towards the Hobo and Abby, but they are able to make a clever getaway. Otis sees them fleeing and calls Slick to inform him of the Hobo's location. As the Hobo and Abby are preparing to leave Hope Town to start a lawnmowing business elsewhere, they are attacked by Slick. Slick and Ivan try to decapitate Abby with a hacksaw and sharpened ice skates. The Hobo forces Ivan to flee in his car, leaving Slick behind. The Hobo begins to threaten an unapologetic Slick and finally fires a shotgun blast into his groin, mutilating Slick's penis and tearing apart his genitals. While standing at a payphone bleeding to death, Slick makes one final call to his father, as the badly burned school bus from earlier appears and brings Slick to hell. The Drake, mourning the death of his favorite son, calls Rip and Grinder , a duo of armour-clad demons known as 'The Plague' to take the Hobo down. While taking Abby to a hospital, the Hobo is ambushed by The Plague. He is captured, and taken to The Drake, who intends to execute him in front of the townspeople in order to set an example. Abby, having later recovered, rallies together a crowd of angry people and leads them to hunt down The Drake, taking the Hobo's shotgun  and a lawnmower engine as weapons. Abby finds and confronts The Drake, Ivan and the Plague. She threatens to kill Ivan with the lawnmower, but The Drake simply shoots his astonished son when he decides Ivan is a disappointment and not worth saving. In the ensuing fight, Abby releases the Hobo and returns his shotgun to him. She also kills Grinder before The Drake cuts her hand off with the lawnmower. She manages to incapacitate The Drake by stabbing him repeatedly in the stomach with her exposed arm bone. Abby saves the Hobo and he prepares to fight Rip. Rip then tells Abby that she must join The Plague to replace Grinder, but the Hobo refuses to allow her to do it and The Plague departs. The Hobo prepares to finish off The Drake, who was trying to crawl away to safety, when the corrupt police arrive and draw their guns against him. The Drake tells the Hobo that he would have liked him if he wasn't so crazy, and that he will never be accepted by society, before snarling for him to just fire the shotgun already and send them both to Hell. The townspeople, motivated by Abby's bravery, have shown up with their own weapons and proceed to aim them at the shocked police, who demand that they leave the area. Seeing that the police will kill the people they failed to protect against The Drake's evil, the Hobo tells the villain that on their upcoming ride to Hell ""I've got shotgun"" and blows The Drake's head off. The police open fire on the Hobo as Abby screams, but the people then turn their guns on the police and blow them all away, as the Hobo dies and the movie ends. In an extended ending that was cut from the final cut of the film, Abby's hand is replaced by several shotguns as she becomes part of The Plague."

Tom and Ryan have spent the last three years trying to locate an international hitman known as the Lion , however, the assassin has always been one step ahead. One night, the police receive a tip from a man claiming that he suspects the Lion is his son, and he provides the police with a location. Tom, Ryan and other law enforcement arrive at the suspect's house, only to discover that the suspect is gone and they find Tom’s wife Kelly  tied up in the basement with explosives on the walls, and Kelly surrounded by a black outline. Tom receives a phone call from the Lion, telling Tom that the bombs will explode in two minutes, and that if he enters that outline, they will be remotely detonated. The Lion, angry at Tom for messing up his network in the Southwest USA, gives Tom a choice -- there is a glass switch that can stop the bombs from detonating, but it's taped in front of Kelly's heart and that the exact location is marked with a red, heart-shaped sticker on Kelly's blouse. The Lion tells Tom that he can shoot the switch, and therefore kill Kelly, in order to stop the bombs from detonating, or Tom can let the bombs detonate and kill everyone in the house. Tom is also told that if he and his colleagues attempt to evacuate, the explosives will be remotely detonated. The Lion informs Tom that either way, saving Kelly's life is out of the question. Tom, devastated by the choice, pleads with the Lion to allow one of Tom's colleagues to shoot him in the head instead, but the Lion refuses, stating that Kelly's death will be completely painless to her, and that Tom can turn the lights off if he wishes. Tom, knowing that there is no other way, tells Kelly that he has to turn the lights out, and will then untie her and take her home. He then tells Kelly that he loves her, and signals Ryan to turn the lights off. Tom then shoots and kills Kelly. Eight years later, Tom, still grieving over Kelly's death, has retired and is living in Mexico. FBI agent Isabel Ordonez  tracks Tom down, and tells Tom that the Lion has returned to Albuquerque, and Tom's help is needed as he is an expert on the Lion. Tom initially refuses, but secretly writes down the address at which the Lion will be meeting one of his associates, which he had heard on the tape that Isabel played for him in order to identify the Lion's voice. Tom then returns to Albuquerque, intending to exact revenge on the Lion for Kelly's death. Tom arrives at the address, a nightclub, hoping to find the Lion. Isabel and other FBI agents are also at the location, attempting to identify and arrest the Lion. Tom, not knowing what the Lion looks like, unwittingly allows the Lion to walk directly past him in order to meet with his associate. The Lion accuses his associate of being an informant, or simply stupid, due to the FBI presence in the nightclub. The associate provides the Lion with materials that he had requested, and is then killed by the Lion through the use of a remote-controlled mounted sniper rifle. The Lion then detonates a bomb that he had planted inside the nightclub in order to cover his escape through the rear exit. The associate's bodyguard chases after the Lion, and Tom follows both of them into the outside alley. Tom discovers the bodyguard lying dead with his throat slit, and then begins to slowly search the alleyway. During this time, a SWAT team is searching the building that the Lion's associate was shot from, but accidentally walk past motion detector, causing an explosion in which the team is killed. Tom, still searching the alley, notices a truck, and cautiously begins to approach it. The Lion, preparing to escape via a motorbike in the back of the truck, sees Tom approaching through the driver's side mirror, and begins firing at Tom through the side of the truck. Tom returns fire, but both men empty their magazines, forcing them to reload. Tom then approaches the driver's side door and begins firing into the back of the truck, but notices that the Lion is no longer there. The Lion then attacks Tom from behind, his face covered by the motorbike helmet, and the two men get into an intense brawl. The Lion gets the upper hand and prepares to cut Tom's throat, however, an unmarked police car enters the alley, forcing the Lion to abandon Tom and make his escape. The FBI agent, Special Agent William ""Hops"" Hopter  mistakes Tom for one of the Lion's associates, and arrests him. Tom is later identified as a  Detective and is asked by Hops to assist the FBI's task force. Tom's old partner Ryan is now a Special Agent with the FBI, and is also a part of the case. It seems that the Lion might be targeting Senator Cordero , who used to be a DEA agent. Tom wants to find the Lion, for the safety of the people of Albuquerque, and he wants to bring the Lion down for what happened to Kelly. Terror erupts in the city as people are taken hostage and bombs explode. And what no one knows is that the Lion is a man named David Kaplow. The FBI and several other agencies are gathering to stop Kaplow once and for all. They have him in the city and they don’t intend on letting him get away but he always manages to stay one step ahead of them. At the climax, Kaplow makes his big plan by bombing the FBI headquarters and kidnapping Ordonez in order to make Tom follow him. After Tom helps the wounded Hops and his crew from the exploding building, he comes to Ordonez house and finds that Kaplow has tied her up with a bomb. Tom and Kaplow have a combat where Kaplow takes the advantage before threatening Ordonez causing Tom to handcuff himself. Then Kaplow escapes with a smile and a wound from the young policeman, thinking that Tom and Ordonez are dead. However, Tom surprisingly calls him and asks him about an armour that he gave to Kaplow which was originally a bomb. Finally, Tom detonates the bomb and Kaplow explodes while inside the car he used for escaping."

However, they're interrupted by Laura t-boning the van with her SUV. Laura decides to enter the county's preliminary sculpture competition herself because of the social status that comes with winning. Meanwhile, Destiny decides to enter as well. Carol-Ann Stevenson  and Brooke also enter. Brooke is simply entering to harass the Picklers because Bob still owes her $600. Despite practice, Laura comes in second to Destiny while Brooke and Carol-Ann come in third and fourth respectively. Brooke shows up at the Pickler's house looking for her money and is let in by their daughter Kaitlin . While talking in her room, Kaitlin challenges her to a game of truth or dare which escalates to them having sex. Kaitlin is drawn to Brooke's alternative style and attitude, but Brooke is just doing it because Kaitlin says she can get her the money she wants . At the same time, Laura hooks up with a used car salesman and old boyfriend from high school, Boyd Bolton  to get him to falsely testify to county officials that he was paid by Ethan to help Destiny in the sculpture competition. Laura suggests a rematch at the state fair to the frustration of everyone but Destiny, who agrees. Brooke gets her money from Kaitlin , meets Destiny after school, and takes her to the mall to buy her a $1,200 set of chef's knives to help her in the rematch with Laura. Later when Destiny comes home, she finds out from a social worker that her biological mother has died. At the state fair, Laura competes with Destiny in the rematch. Laura carves a replica of John F. Kennedy's car immediately after his assassination complete with the president's blown up skull and Jackie Kennedy and Clint Hill crawling on the trunk, while Destiny creates her biological mother holding her infant self in a rocking chair. That night before the judging, Boyd sneaks into the fair and defaces Destiny's sculpture. Despite this, her sculpture wins. Later, Destiny is officially adopted by the Emmets and Laura is running for Governor of Iowa, claiming she was visited by God in a vision telling her to run.

A rival barker named Hollinger tries to get Liliom in trouble by telling the jealous Mme. Muscat, who is having an affair with Liliom, that Liliom flirts with his customers behind her back. When Mme. Muscat insults Liliom's female customers Julie and Marie, Liliom comes to their defense, which leads to Mme. Muscat firing Liliom. Liliom makes a date with Julie and Marie and leaves the carousel. When he meets the girls later, Liliom tells them that he intends to only take one of them out, which leads to Liliom going only with Julie. Julie is infatuated with Liliom and they move in together in a run-down trailer. Julie works in a photo studio while Liliom loafs, drinks and gets into violent arguments with Julie. Mme. Muscat later tries to bring Liliom back to the carousel by offering him a substantial raise. Liliom considers it but denies the offer finding that Julie is expecting a child. Liliom's criminal friend Alfred suggests that the two rob the local payroll clerk, and insists that Liliom bring a knife, as Alfred will also do. Desperate to find money for the child, Liliom agrees. The robbery attempt is foiled and Liliom finds himself cornered by the police. Rather than be arrested, Liliom stabs himself with the kitchen knife he brought with him to commit the robbery. An unconscious Liliom is brought home on a stretcher. Near death, he repents and tells Julie that he must face the judgement of God. He then dies. Liliom's soul rises from his body when he is visited by two uniformed agents who identify themselves as God's Police. They take Liliom to Heaven where he is taken to an area for suicides. There, Liliom is questioned by an officious commissioner who looks exactly like a police commissioner that Lilom reported to once while alive. When Liliom refuses to explain to the clerk why he beat Julie, he is first shown a silent film of one of his arguments with her, then again with a soundtrack of his thoughts. He realizes that he beat Julie because he hated himself so much for his cruelty and selfishness. The Commissioner sentences Liliom to sixteen years in purgatory, so that he will be cleansed of his pride and violence. Afterwards, he will be allowed one day back on Earth to visit his child, and his behavior on that day will determine where he shall spend eternity. Sixteen years pass and Liliom is allowed to visit his daughter, who is named Louise in the play, but whose name is not mentioned in this film version. One of the angels reminds Liliom to bring his daughter something beautiful, and Liliom surreptitiously steals a star on his way down to Earth. Liliom approaches Louise and tells her that he knew her father many years ago, and that he was a violent brute. This disgusts Louise, who throws Liliom's gift of a star into the gutter. Liliom follows the sobbing Louise home, where she demands to be alone. Liliom slaps her hand out of frustration before disappearing. As Liliom returns to Heaven, the angels watch as the scales of justice tip toward the devil's side, and the devil begins to inscribe Liliom's name on his tablet. In Heaven, the commissioner is furious at Liliom for breaking the heart of a child, and Liliom responds that one can only love him as he is. Just then the angel-typist excitedly points to a scene happening down on Earth. Louise is then seen telling her mother that Liliom's slap felt like a kiss, and asks if it is possible to receive a slap that doesn't hurt at all. Julie says yes and the two embrace with tears in their eyes. It is Liliom's love for his daughter which has miraculously made the slap feel exactly like a kiss. The scales of justice tip toward the heavenly side and Liliom's name is slowly removed from the devil's tablet.

Brant is approached by PC Elizabeth Falls  asking to help her in passing her Sergeant's exam. Brant advises her to give it some time as she has come out of rehab recently. Falls had previously worked undercover for the drugs squad and became addicted. Brant is also warned by his superior  to control his actions. It transpires during a session between Brant and a police psychologist who mentions incidents involving bugging the Superintendent's office, beating a person unconscious in a billiards hall and the earlier assault on the three youths. Brant goes to the funeral of the Chief Inspector Roberts's  wife. The same night PC Sandra Bates  is shot dead by an unknown assailant. Sgt Porter Nash  is transferred from West London Branch as Acting Inspector, in place of Roberts who is on extended leave. A boy approaches PC Falls in her home and asks for help as he thinks he killed someone during a gang attack. Falls asked Brant for a favour and he gives her the name of Detective Inspector  Craig Stokes ([[Luke Evans . The Shooter, Barry Weiss , calls reporter Harold Dunlop  and tells him that he is the killer. He asks Dunlop to pick between seven and eight and when Dunlop picks eight, Weiss tells him that's the number of cops he will kill. Weiss walks down the street and shoots PC Theo Nelson , who is sitting in his car. The South East London station is thrown into chaos due to the shootings. Brant meets with an informant Radnor  who points him in the direction of Weiss, telling him that Weiss had previously boasted about setting a police dog on fire ""for practice"". Brant meets Nash and tells him about his personal problem of recurring blackouts. Nash tells him that Brant might be experiencing burn out based on his personal experience, as well as confiding that he once attacked a paedophile in his house as there was not sufficient evidence to convict him. Brant tells him about the lead and they both decide to visit Weiss. Meanwhile Chief Inspector Roberts rejoins his duty. At Weiss's apartment Brant recognises him as the guy whom he beat in the billiards hall. Weiss panics after the visit and flees his apartment. Unknown to both parties Radnor is spying on Weiss and, on seeing Weiss leave, Radnor sifts through his rubbish and finds a parking receipt. Weiss follows Roberts to his apartment and after a struggle, he kills him by pulverising his head with a hammer. Realising his trail of forensic evidence he steals a police uniform and Roberts's badge and burns the flat. He then calls Dunlop and tells him about the murder and that he is now calling himself Blitz. Nash informs Brant about the incident. Radnor goes to the parking garage and finds Weiss's car. He opens it and finds trophies of his kills. He calls Dunlop and asks for £50,000 in exchange for revealing the killer's identity. Falls goes to meet DI Stokes and asks him to bury the name of the boy and in return Stokes asks her out for a drink. Dunlop meets Radnor and they go the parking garage where Radnor shows him the car and the evidence in it. However Weiss sees this and quickly removes the evidence from the car. He follows them to a bar and kills Radnor in the men's toilet before Radnor can reveal his identity to Dunlop. Dunlop tells Brant and Nash about his meeting with Radnor and the location of the parked car. When they arrive, however, the car is empty and the building's CCTV is faulty, giving them no evidence on Weiss. Falls and Stokes meet for a drink, as Weiss watches them from across the street. In the station Brant finds out the connection between the dead police officers and Weiss. Weiss is attacking all the cops who arrested him and Falls is next in line. Stokes drops Falls at her home and says he will call her tomorrow, which Falls interprets as rejection and angrily leaves the car. Weiss attacks Falls but the boy who Falls was trying to protect interrupts and is killed instead. Brant and Nash visit Weiss's apartment and, on finding it abandoned, decide to release his photo to the media. A taxi driver identifies him and leads the police to his location. He briefly escapes but is pursued by Brant and caught in a train yard near Paddington. Falls, traumatised by the attack, has a relapse and steals drugs from a dealer. At the station Brant, Nash and the Chief Inspector discuss that Weiss may walk due to the lack of evidence. Later Brant talks to Nash about the paedophile incident but Nash declines to talk any further. Brant taunts Weiss about his name 'Blitz' and tells him he is nothing, but is unable to provoke him into admitting to the killings. Meanwhile Stokes finds out from his informant that Falls is stealing drugs from dealers and contacts Brant. They reach her house and find her intoxicated, then throw away the drugs and help her regain her senses. Weiss is released but placed under surveillance. He returns to his flat and changes into the police uniform stolen from Roberts's flat, then dodges the surveillance and drives to Roberts's funeral. There, he finds Brant and at that time Brant receives a text message and leaves. Weiss follows him to the parking garage he had previously left his evidence in. After following him up a flight of stairs, Weiss aims his pistol at Brant and tells him to face him. But when he turns around, it is Nash in the hoodie and Brant then attacks Weiss from behind with a crowbar. Weiss gloats that, given the extrajudicial beating he has just received from Brant, he will be able to successfully sue for millions due to police misconduct. As Weiss goes on gloating, Nash picks up the pistol Weiss dropped, the same gun used in the previous killings, and hands it to Brant. Weiss quickly realises Brant's intentions and warns him how his death would be treated by the media. Brant informs him that there was no evidence, that Weiss was cleared and is no longer under police investigation, that the real 'Blitz' was partial to people in uniform and shooting them with the same pistol he is holding. Brant then shoots him in the head. Brant and Nash leave the rooftop with Brant joking that the case might remain unsolved. The film ends with Brant releasing two dogs on Harold Dunlop."

But before the deal is contracted, the king and queen learn that Fiona has been rescued. Rumpelstiltskin is then shown to have become washed up as a result and subsequently bitter towards Shrek for inadvertently ruining his plans. In the present, Shrek has steadily grown tired of being a family man and celebrity among the local villagers, leading him to yearn for the days when he felt like a ""real ogre"". He takes his family to Far Far Away to celebrate his children's first birthday. Shrek gets annoyed when the three little pigs eat the kids' cake along with most of the other party food. A boy named Butterpants  demands that Shrek roar. After he lets out a frustrated roar the entire crowd cheers, reinforcing his belief that no one considers him to be a true ogre. This coupled with the fact that the birthday cakes were decorated with a ""cute"" Ogre named ""Sprinkles"" finally makes Shrek snap and he smashes the new birthday cake in anger. He and Fiona argue outside about his reaction which ends with Shrek rashly agreed that he was happier before he'd rescued her. After storming off, Shrek encounters Rumpelstiltskin. Rumpel, who had observed Shrek's angry outburst with Fiona, seizes his chance. He follows Shrek and arranges what appears to be an accident where he is trapped under his carriage. Shrek helps him and Rumpel being ""grateful"", gives Shrek a ride and a meal. When Shrek voices his frustrations, Rumpel offers to give Shrek a day to live like a real ogre in exchange for a day from his childhood that he would not remember being erased. Shrek signs the contract and appears in a reality where he is still feared by villagers. He takes the opportunity to cause some light hearted mischief until he finds wanted posters for the ogress Fiona and his home deserted and desolate. He is kidnapped by witches and taken to Rumpelstiltskin, now the King of Far Far Away and possibly Emperor of a good deal more, which has become derelict and run down. Rumpelstiltskin uses ogres and some of Shrek's friends as slave labor. Upon inquiry, Rumpelstiltskin reveals that the day he erased was the day that Shrek was born. Therefore, Shrek never saved Fiona, never met Donkey, and consequently Rumpelstiltskin was able to get Harold and Lillian to sign their kingdom away, then cause them to disappear. When the day ends, Shrek will fade from existence. Shrek escapes Rumpelstiltskin's castle with Donkey. Initially terrified of Shrek, Donkey decides to trust him after seeing Shrek cry over his lost past, something he had never seen an ogre do before. After Shrek explains the situation, Donkey helps him find a loophole: the contract will be nullified if Shrek and Fiona share true love's kiss. Shrek and Donkey first travel to the dragon's keep where Fiona was kept and find the place deserted and the lava from the crater under the castle has been drained. They soon encounter a band of ogres who are resisting Rumpelstiltskin. The ogres are led by Fiona, who is still cursed after escaping from the tower where she was held captive, and keeps the retired and overweight Puss in Boots as a pet. Shrek does everything he can to gain Fiona's love, but she is too busy preparing an ambush on Rumpelstiltskin. She is also bitterly cynical and disillusioned about the power of true love and throws herself into planning Rumpelstiltskin's capture. While sparring with her, Fiona begins to like Shrek, but stops short of kissing him. Shrek is discouraged, but Puss encourages him to continue pursuing Fiona. During the ambush, the ogres are captured by the Pied Piper, though Shrek and Fiona managed to escape with the intervention of Puss and Donkey. Shrek insists Fiona kiss him, saying it will fix everything, but because Fiona does not truly love him it is ineffective. Upon hearing that Rumpelstiltskin is offering anything desired by the one who captures Shrek, Shrek surrenders himself in exchange for all the ogres being released. Fiona remains in custody because she is only an ogre by night . Shrek and Fiona are to be fed to Dragon, but Donkey, Puss and the ogres raid Rumpelstiltskin's castle, allowing Shrek and Fiona to both subdue Dragon and capture Rumpelstiltskin. As the sun rises, Shrek begins to fade from existence. But Fiona, having fallen in love with him, kisses him just before he disappears, thereby voiding the contract and restoring the world to just before Shrek originally lashed out at everyone. Shrek embraces his friends and family with a newfound appreciation for everything he has, truly living happily ever after."

Ben Jonson, who has the manuscripts, hides them in the Rose theatre, but it is burned down while being searched. Successive flashbacks cast us back five and then forty years, as the film evokes the reputed life of Edward de Vere from childhood through to his entanglement in an insurrection, and later on to his death. The main action takes place towards the end of the Elizabethan era as political intrigue flourishes between the Tudors and the Cecils , over the succession to Queen Elizabeth I. In flashbacks, de Vere is portrayed as a prodigious genius, writing at eight or nine years of age  A Midsummer Night's Dream, de Vere acting the role of Puck before the young queen Elizabeth. He is then forced to live in the repressive, puritanical house of William Cecil where, years later, he kills a spying servant lurking behind an arras, much like the death of Polonius in Hamlet. William Cecil uses this murder to blackmail de Vere into a loveless marriage with his daughter, Anne Cecil, compelling him also to renounce literature. De Vere later becomes the Queen's lover, and sires – unknown to him – an illegitimate son; the son is adopted, becoming Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton, but his true parentage is hidden from all but the Cecils. De Vere must struggle against a taboo that would forbid him to write; against his wife's impatience with his literary work as a dishonour to her family;{{harvnb}}:'his literary efforts were considered an improper use of a nobleman’s time – “you’re writing again,” his wife hisses, as if she’d caught him fondling the scullery maid. “Why must you continue to humiliate my family?” Thus he scribbles in secret.' and against the Queen's counsellors. Foremost among these is his father-in-law William Cecil, who is convinced that theatres are sinful. Cecil's plan to have James, the son of Mary, Queen of Scots crowned king is also threatened by the presence of de Vere's and the Queen's child, who would be an alternative contender for the throne, and also of pure Tudor lineage. Almost four decades after his private première, de Vere visits a public theatre and is deeply impressed by the way spectators can be swayed. The play, written by Ben Jonson, is halted mid-perfomance by the royal militia because of its allegedly seditious content. Jonson is arrested and imprisoned. Much taken by the propagandistic power of art, considering that ""all art is political ... otherwise it is just decoration,"" de Vere decides to employ his secretly written plays for the promotion of the Earl of Essex's cause  over the candidate preferred by the Cecils, writing Henry V and, later, Richard III as propaganda designed to foment revolution. He contacts Jonson, who is confined in the Tower of London until de Vere uses his influence to free him, in order to have his play Henry V staged under Jonson's name. Jonson is unhappy about the plan, assuming that the play will be an amateurish effort that will tarnish his name. Jonson does not claim authorship, allowing an unscrupulous young actor, William Shakespeare, to step up on stage as author. It is this ""drunken oaf"" who takes on the role as de Vere's front man, while Jonson becomes de Vere's only confidant in the truth. Shakespeare however, having discovered the real author's identity, extorts money from de Vere to build the Globe theatre, and wangles £400 per year for posturing as a front. After Christopher Marlowe stumbles on the truth that Shakespeare's inexplicable talents hide the genius of another hand, he is found with his throat slit. Jonson later confronts Shakespeare and accuses him of the murder. At the climax, de Vere uses the play Richard III as a thinly veiled attack on the hunchbacked Robert Cecil. The plan is to incite a mob to march against Cecil, and thus weaken his position at court. At the same time, Essex is to march with the Earl of Southampton to the Palace, to promote his own claim to the succession. Meanwhile, de Vere writes Venus and Adonis to remind the Queen of their old love. He hopes to see her again in an atmosphere of renewed intimacy, and to persuade her to dismiss Cecil. However the plan fails, as a jealous Jonson betrays the plot to Cecil, who guns down the mob, stopping it from joining Essex. The Queen, swayed by Cecil, thinks that Essex is trying to depose her violently. Cecil easily captures Essex and Southampton, who are condemned for treason. Robert Cecil then tells a broken de Vere that Elizabeth had other bastard sons – one of which was de Vere himself. If true, it would mean that de Vere committed incest with his mother. He has a private audience with Elizabeth, at which the Queen agrees to save Southampton, but insists that de Vere remain anonymous as the true author of 'Shakespeare's' works. After the Queen's death, James succeeds, though Cecil's hopes of a more puritanical regime are shattered when James expresses his wish to see more of Shakespeare's work. Shakespeare retires on his ill-gotten gains to Stratford to become a businessman, and de Vere dies in 1604, having commended his manuscripts to the care of a repentant Ben Jonson. Cecil however still wants the manuscripts destroyed. With the destruction of the Rose, he believes them burnt, but Jonson later discovers they have survived. Nevertheless, the 'truth' that Edward de Vere, not the nearly illiterate Shakespeare, is their real author remains concealed."

Meanwhile, a corrupt DEA Agent named Pollen  is after a cache of dirty money that belongs to him. He tracks it back to the house Duke's neighbors live in and gets there before Duke does. There is a shootout, and Pollen is injured. Duke arrives and finds the aftermath, and the money. Duke takes the money, believing that it will mean a better life for himself and Amber. Pollen tries to stop him, but passes out due to his injuries. Duke gets home and gets Amber, and the two flee. Pollen wakes up and finds two other Agents after the money, and they team up and go after them to get back what is theirs. Duke and Amber buy a car and travel to an expensive Albuquerque hotel, and spend a few days gambling and having fun, and finally getting married. Amber also tells Duke that she is pregnant. Pollen and his men arrive the next day, however, and start searching for Duke. A room-service man takes the money from them, and Duke goes after him to get the cache back. Amber, meanwhile, is ambushed by Pollen, who threatens to kill her if she doesn't tell him where the money is. Amber tells him that Duke left her after she got pregnant, and Pollen believes her. He's about to kill her when she cuts him with a shard of glass and kills one of the other detectives. Pollen and the other Agent go after them, but Duke and Amber eventually escape, leaving the money hidden behind a bush as a bargaining tool should Pollen catch them. Pollen is questioned by two suspicious Detectives, who start following the DEA Agent around. Duke soon calls Pollen and says he doesn't want any more of it, and that they'll give him the money that day if they'll let Duke and Amber go. Pollen agrees, and deduces that they would have left the money at the hotel for safety. Duke goes back to get it, but the money is gone. He finds out a gardener quit the previous day, and he goes after the gardener. Sure enough the man took the money, and Duke leaves the man some of it when he learns the gardener has children. Pollen and Morton follow Duke and Amber directly behind them. Duke pulls off at an abandoned warehouse, and the DEA Agents follow, with the detectives on their trails. After exchanging words, Pollen reveals that Morton has Amber tied up. Pollen then takes out horrific tools to make sure that Duke didn't tell anyone about what Pollen has done, but Duke fights back, killing the other detective. Pollen wounds Duke and the two fight. Pollen beats Duke with an iron pipe, but before Pollen can finish the beating, Amber kills him with Morton's shotgun. Duke dies of his injuries. One of the detectives enters the building, and unseen by Amber, manipulates the evidence so it appears that Pollen is at fault. Sometime later Amber is feeding a baby boy, and the camera pans back to show a new suburban house.

The drug, a modified virus, mutates a chimpanzee, giving her a human level of intelligence. She later goes on a rampage which is seen as a side effect of the drug. When Will's boss Steven Jacobs  subsequently orders chimp handler Robert Franklin  to euthanize the remaining test chimpanzees Franklin discovers the chimp had given birth and was only protecting her baby. Unable to bring himself to kill the baby chimp, Robert gives him to Will, who takes him home to raise. Will's father Charles , who is suffering from Alzheimer's disease, names the baby chimp ""Caesar."" Caesar  has inherited his mother's high intelligence and develops quickly. One day, after he frightens the children of their neighbor, Douglas Hunsiker , and receives a cut on his palm, Will takes him to the San Francisco Zoo where primatologist Caroline Aranha  treats his injury. Will begins to take Caesar on excursions to the redwood forest at Muir Woods National Monument, but after seeing a family's German shepherd, Caesar begins to resent his status as a human ""pet."" When Caesar questions his identity, Will tells him that his mother was given a drug and that the reason for his intelligence is that the drug affected him while still in the womb. Caesar becomes more aware of his biological identity and begins to view himself as different from his human family. A desperate Will tests a sample of his cure on his father. At first, his father's condition improves, but eventually his dementia returns. Confused, he attempts to drive Hunsiker's car, and damages it, angering Hunsiker. Caesar witnesses the confrontation and attacks Hunsiker, prompting authorities to place him in a primate shelter run by John Landon ([[Brian Cox , where he is treated cruelly by the other apes and the chief guard, Landon's son Dodge . Caesar escapes from his cell and frees a gorilla called Buck kept in solitary confinement. With Buck's assistance, Caesar gains dominance over the other apes by beating the sanctuary's alpha chimp. Will creates a more powerful form of the virus to resume treating his father, and boss Jacobs clears its testing on chimpanzees, which further increases their intelligence. However, unbeknownst to the scientists, it is fatal to humans. Franklin is exposed to the new virus and begins sneezing blood. Attempting to contact Will at his home, he accidentally infects Hunsiker, and he is then later discovered dead in his apartment. Will attempts to warn Jacobs against further testing but when Jacobs refuses to listen, Will quits his job. After his father's death, Will bribes the elder Landon into releasing Caesar into his custody, but Caesar refuses to leave. He later escapes from the ape facility on his own and returns to Will's house, where he steals canisters of the new virus and releases it throughout the cage area at the facility, enhancing the intelligence of his fellow apes. The apes put an escape plan into motion. Landon's son Dodge attempts to intervene, leading to a fight with Caesar. Caesar shocks Dodge by shouting ""No!"" at him, and later kills him through electrocution. The liberated apes storm the city and release the remaining apes from Gen-Sys, as well as the entire ape population of a zoo. A terrible battle follows as the apes force their way past a police blockade on the Golden Gate Bridge to escape into the Redwood forest. Buck sacrifices his life to save Caesar, jumping into a police helicopter  as they try to shoot Caesar. Buck damages the helicopter severely forcing it to crash on the bridge. A still alive Jacobs trapped in the helicopter is finally killed when Koba, an ape who had spent a lifetime being tested on, kicks the helicopter off the bridge. As the apes find their way into the Redwood forest Will arrives and warns Caesar that the humans will hunt them down, and begs him to return home. To Will's surprise Caesar speaks like a human, telling him that ""Caesar is home"" among his fellow apes. The final image shows the apes climbing to the tops of the Redwood trees, looking out over the Golden Gate Bridge and the San Francisco Bay.

The drug, a modified virus, mutates a chimpanzee, giving her a human level of intelligence. She later goes on a rampage which is seen as a side effect of the drug. When Will's boss Steven Jacobs  subsequently orders chimp handler Robert Franklin  to euthanize the remaining test chimpanzees Franklin discovers the chimp had given birth and was only protecting her baby. Unable to bring himself to kill the baby chimp, Robert gives him to Will, who takes him home to raise. Will's father Charles , who is suffering from Alzheimer's disease, names the baby chimp ""Caesar."" Caesar  has inherited his mother's high intelligence and develops quickly. One day, after he frightens the children of their neighbor, Douglas Hunsiker , and receives a cut on his palm, Will takes him to the San Francisco Zoo where primatologist Caroline Aranha  treats his injury. Will begins to take Caesar on excursions to the redwood forest at Muir Woods National Monument, but after seeing a family's German shepherd, Caesar begins to resent his status as a human ""pet."" When Caesar questions his identity, Will tells him that his mother was given a drug and that the reason for his intelligence is that the drug affected him while still in the womb. Caesar becomes more aware of his biological identity and begins to view himself as different from his human family. A desperate Will tests a sample of his cure on his father. At first, his father's condition improves, but eventually his dementia returns. Confused, he attempts to drive Hunsiker's car, and damages it, angering Hunsiker. Caesar witnesses the confrontation and attacks Hunsiker, prompting authorities to place him in a primate shelter run by John Landon ([[Brian Cox , where he is treated cruelly by the other apes and the chief guard, Landon's son Dodge . Caesar escapes from his cell and frees a gorilla called Buck kept in solitary confinement. With Buck's assistance, Caesar gains dominance over the other apes by beating the sanctuary's alpha chimp. Will creates a more powerful form of the virus to resume treating his father, and boss Jacobs clears its testing on chimpanzees, which further increases their intelligence. However, unbeknownst to the scientists, it is fatal to humans. Franklin is exposed to the new virus and begins sneezing blood. Attempting to contact Will at his home, he accidentally infects Hunsiker, and he is then later discovered dead in his apartment. Will attempts to warn Jacobs against further testing but when Jacobs refuses to listen, Will quits his job. After his father's death, Will bribes the elder Landon into releasing Caesar into his custody, but Caesar refuses to leave. He later escapes from the ape facility on his own and returns to Will's house, where he steals canisters of the new virus and releases it throughout the cage area at the facility, enhancing the intelligence of his fellow apes. The apes put an escape plan into motion. Landon's son Dodge attempts to intervene, leading to a fight with Caesar. Caesar shocks Dodge by shouting ""No!"" at him, and later kills him through electrocution. The liberated apes storm the city and release the remaining apes from Gen-Sys, as well as the entire ape population of a zoo. A terrible battle follows as the apes force their way past a police blockade on the Golden Gate Bridge to escape into the Redwood forest. Buck sacrifices his life to save Caesar, jumping into a police helicopter  as they try to shoot Caesar. Buck damages the helicopter severely forcing it to crash on the bridge. A still alive Jacobs trapped in the helicopter is finally killed when Koba, an ape who had spent a lifetime being tested on, kicks the helicopter off the bridge.

During the ceremony, chauffeur Karl Schneider ([[John Gilbert  arrives, and soon finds an old acquaintance - a former lover - Countess De Marnac , who appears unsatisfied with Karl mending with her elite friends. That night, when Françoise , one of the butlers, gets too drunk too work, Albert is summoned to take over his shift. Anna, now unaccompanied, is visited by Karl, who wins over her sympathy by telling her about his unfortunate childhood. One day, Karl drives the baroness Eloise  to Vienna for shopping purposes. Despite her initial cold attitude towards him, Eloise takes a liking in him and they start an affair. When they return home, Eloise claims that they were in an accident, but Albert does not believe her and immediately grows suspicious of the affair. He confronts Karl, reminding him of his social position, and warns him to never interfere with the upper-class people. Even though Karl agrees with Albert's advice, he jumps his chances to seduce Anna, who he soon concludes is very naive and easy manipulable. He tries to kiss her, but she slaps him and warns him never to try again. As Albert returns to the room, Karl decides to leave to avoid a remorseful situation, and escorts himself to the room of the cook Sophie , whom he spends the night with. The next day, he insults Sophie and lies about being the illegitimate son of royalty in order to extort money from her. He next uses a jewel he has found from Eloise's room and never returned to offer it to Anna, though she is disgusted by what he has done to Sophie and rejects it. He pins the jewel on her crucifix necklace anyway, and Eloise soon recognizes it as her own. When she accuses Anna of stealing, Karl comes to the rescue, claiming the jewel to be his own, winning back Anna's sympathy. She later discusses the matter with the Baron, and Albert overhears her saying that Karl and Anna are involved in an affair. Eloise, who is excited about the scandal, arranges for them to have some privacy together on a fishing trip, but the Baron last minute demands Albert to come along. Albert then confronts Karl, warning him to stay away from Anna. Karl and Anna stay behind, and he again jumps his chances by taking her to a pub. They grow close, until she finds out that he has arranged a room for the two to stay it. Disgusted at his intentions, she leaves. Karl follows her to her room, and claims that he only lied to and deceived her because he is very much in love with her. Vulnerable to his words, Anna becomes worried when he announces that he will leave the mansion. Karl notices this and kisses her passionately as a 'goodbye'. They end up spending the night together. As soon as Albert returns from the trip, he fires Karl over a plausible reason and then unleashes his frustration on Anna by criticizing her appearance. Anna, in tears, blames him for having driven her to seek affection with another man. Karl, meanwhile, blackmails the baroness into reinstalling him as a chauffeur. Albert feels humiliated and tells Eloise that he will resign. Eloise tries to stop him and, in tears, admits to being blackmailed. Albert advises her to step to the police, but she tells him she can't, because her affair with him cannot go public. Albert, who sympathizes with her, agrees to stay, and plans to destroy Karl. That night, Sophie, unhappy, offers him all her savings in order to realize her dream of running away with him and opening their own shop. The next morning, Karl, with Sophie's savings, packs his bags to leave, and begs Anna to join him. Anna refuses, remembering him that she is still in love with Albert. They quarrel and are interrupted by Albert, who starts a fight with Karl in the cellar. They end up knocking over some old wine bottles, attracting attention from the Baron. The Baron thinks they are fighting over the wine and order each other to apologize. As soon as the Baron leaves, Albert demands Karl to get out of their lives, and they get in another fight when Karl refuses. Anna, afraid that one might kill one other, informs the Baron about Karl's many deceptions. The Baron demands Karl to leave, and congratulates Albert for his courage and loyalty. Karl leaves the scene, only to plan to scheme his way into another upper class woman's life .

He encounters her once again, now a nurse trainee assisting a doctor treat one of his employees. He finds out that Clarke only became an architect to please her father, who had no sons to follow in his profession. When she saw how her young assistant at her firm, seriously injured in a traffic accident, was tended to by the nurses, she found her true vocation.

He grasps an old okiagari-koboshi musical doll which brings his memories back to August 1945, near the end of the war. In 1945 Yang, a Hebei peasant in his 30s, was captured by Japanese imperial soldiers, and was brought to the Daxing'anling area near Manchuria  after the Japanese slaughtered his aged mother. He was put in a firing squad to be executed. The firing killed everyone in line but Yang. As the Japanese soldiers reloaded their machine gun, a Soviet military tank knocked over the wall against which the captives were lined. Yang was the sole survivor and was put under the charge of Nadja, a young female Soviet lieutenant and her comrades. As Nadja escorted him to the headquarters, their truck was ambushed by the Japanese and Nadja, a fellow Soviet comrade and Yang escaped to a forested area. As they moved in the woods uncertainly, they came across a teenage Japanese schoolgirl named Akibako who was about to commit suicide with a fellow schoolmate in a wooden shed. They took her captive and made her to bring the three out of the vast forest as the girl knew her way out. Akibako brought the three to a minefield where Nadja's partner was blown up by a landmine. Nadja was infuriated by Akibako's cunning, but decided not to kill Akibako as she was their sole guide out of the forest with insufficient food. At many points both Yang and Nadja were tempted to kill Akibako, but eventually saved her life from sinking to her death in a quagmire. Conflicting feelings of mistrust and friendship dogged all three as they rely on one another to survive. Although Nadja wanted to move north to meet with the Soviet troops, Akibako convinced Yang to move south was the only way out of the desolate woods. At one point Nadja happened to stray from her other two partners, but managed to meet them later. Eventually the three found their way to the same location where they discovered Akibako, and they realized they have been tricked by Akibako. A tearful Akibako explained she was trying to get them to surrender to the Japanese troops so that they could get food and lodging at the camp. The three ended at an empty army truck, where the radio began to announce Emperor Hirohito's unconditional surrender to the Allied troops. Akibako, shocked by Japan's loss, grabbed the PPSh-41 Nadja had with her and took aim at Yang and Nadja. However, she was unable to pull the trigger, and convulsed into sobs. Nadja learned later that Yang had removed the cartridge from the SMG earlier on. The war having now ended, Yang urged Akibako to go back to Japan and live a good life. Akibako decided to return to find her childhood sweetheart, who was conscripted as a fighter pilot by the Japanese airforce. The three then witnessed a group of Japanese soldiers and civilians committing mass suicide as they could not accept the fact their country had surrendered. Akibako mistakenly thought they were not informed of the surrender and ran to halt their foolish acts, but was shot dead by a Japanese officer. Her okiagari-koboshi doll rolled out of her grasp and she died. Consumed by fury, Yang and Nadja mounted the army truck and machine-gunning and overrunning the rest of the suiciding Japanese soldiers. After all were killed or had committed suicide, Yang picked up Akibako's okiagari-koboshi doll. The film then fast forwards to present day where an elderly Nadja places flowers on Poklonnaya Gora war memorial with the gigantic numerals ""1945"" to commemorate Akibako's death. The film then flashes back to 1945, where a voice from the truck's radio read out a declaration of peace and harmony, as the remaining Japanese troops threw their arms away in the purple sunset. A statistic of World War 2 casualties rolls up at the credit."

Claire and Luke are the only employees working during its final weekend of operation. Claire, who suffers from severe asthma, has recently dropped out of college, and Luke runs a website chronicling the hotel's supposed hauntings. Both are ghost hunting enthusiasts and are fascinated by the hotel's supposedly haunted history, which includes the legend of Madeline O'Malley, a bride who hung herself in the 1800s when her husband abandoned her on their honeymoon, and whose body was supposedly hidden in the basement by the hotel owners. That afternoon, Luke checks in an older woman, whom Claire recognizes as Leanne Rease-Jones , a former actress who is in town for an unnamed convention.

There they encounter disembodied voices and other paranormal activity, and Luke becomes so frightened that he leaves the hotel. In a state of panic, Claire awakens Leanne and asks for help. Leanne goes to the bottom of the basement stairwell, where she makes contact with a spirit, and then tells Claire that they need to leave the hotel immediately. Claire rushes upstairs to retrieve the elderly man, but upon entering his room, she finds a suicide note and discovers his body in the bathtub, his wrists slashed, with Madeline's apparition hanging from a rope. Panicked, she runs downstairs and finds that Luke has returned to the hotel. He goes upstairs to find Leanne, and Claire hears more noises coming from the basement. She approaches the stairwell, where she is startled by an apparition of the elderly man. She falls down the staircase, injuring her head. Disoriented by her head injury, Claire is followed by the elderly man into the basement and finds herself in the room where Madeline's body was kept. She tries to open the door that leads to the garage, forgetting she had locked it. Confronted by Madeline's apparition, Claire dies of an asthma attack. The next morning, Luke tells police he heard Claire's screams coming from the cellar but could not pry open the door to save her. Luke and Leanne leave with the police. Leanne tells Luke that Claire couldn't have been saved. The film ends with a view of Claire's room door slamming shut.

Beau is clearly smitten by her, and it is later revealed that the two have been having an affair, even though Kelly is married to James . Kelly is checked out of rehab a month early by James, who wants her to go on a three-city tour to restore her image. She agrees on the condition that Beau becomes her opening act, but James has already made plans to see Chiles Stanton , a beauty queen with potential to become a rising singer, perform that night in hopes that she will be Kelly's opener instead. On the night of Chiles' performance, it is revealed that Beau has been acquainted with her before and doesn't want her on the tour, dismissing her as a ""Country Barbie"". Chiles' performance nearly falls apart as she gets stage fright and can't sing; however, Beau steps in and begins to sing ""Friends in Low Places"". The two sing the song together, and it gives Chiles the courage to continue on her own. James is impressed by Beau's performance, and offers the opening act to both Beau and Chiles. He suggests to Beau that he and Chiles could make quite the duo, but Beau disagrees. Nevertheless, Beau agrees to go on the tour because he cares so much about Kelly. The first show is a disaster: before going on, Kelly receives an anonymous package containing a bloody baby doll with a note reading ""Baby Killer,"" referring to the baby Kelly miscarried when she fell off the stage in Dallas during her last concert before she went into rehab. At that concert, she was five months pregnant and was found to have a blood alcohol level of 0.19 when she was in the hospital for the injuries related to the fall. Kelly falls apart, starts drinking, and almost refuses to go on. However, she is coerced into going on stage by James. She begins to sing ""Country Strong"" but breaks down on stage. She attempts to try another song, ""A Fighter"", but breaks down again and is led off stage by her husband, ending the show. They tell the media at a press conference that they had to cancel the show due to food poisoning and head off to the next show. Beau ends his relationship with Kelly, and begins to spend more time with Chiles, whose fame has been increasing as the tour progresses. Both Chiles and Beau form a bond and Beau lets go of his earlier hostilities towards her. She even finishes the chorus to his song ""Give in to Me"". Later, Beau confronts James about Kelly's worsening condition. James insists that Kelly may get better, and says that he can't let her go out with a failure. Beau disagrees and subtly admits their affair. Enraged, James punches him in the jaw and leaves the room. Before the next show in Austin, Kelly gets drunk and is unable to go on stage. Beau and Chiles still do their opening act, and it is then that they perform ""Give in to Me"" for the first time together. JJ, Kelly's agent, nearly cancels the tour but is dissuaded by Kelly's offer of sex. Beau witnesses this and becomes frustrated with Kelly. That same night, Chiles and Beau have sex, and Beau confesses to Chiles that he likes her. In Dallas, Beau gives Chiles a pair of star-shaped earrings she had said she always wanted and asks her to move with him to California. Chiles immediately says yes, but changes her mind and asks him for time to consider the offer. The two perform and Kelly comes out, this time sober and ready, and performs her entire set for the first time. Kelly is seen performing ""Country Strong"", ""Shake That Thing"", and ""Coming Home"". After the concert, James and JJ immediately begin making plans for Kelly's future. That night, Kelly commits suicide by overdosing on prescription medication. She leaves a letter to Beau, echoing his earlier words that ""Love and fame can't live in the same place."" In the letter, she gives him the advice to choose ""love"".

Liu Bei's family and his concubine, Qilan, were staying in Cao Cao's territory together with Guan Yu. Cao Cao constantly presented Guan Yu with precious gifts, hoping that the general will be touched and decide to remain by his side, but Guan refused to renounce his loyalty to Liu Bei. When there were news that Liu Bei had sought refuge under Yuan Shao, Guan Yu negotiated with Cao Cao to release Liu Bei's family, and Cao agreed, while Qilan remained behind with Guan. As Cao Cao was aware that Guan Yu was secretly in love with Qilan, he tricked Guan into consuming food spiked with aphrodisiac, in hope that Guan would express his feelings to Qilan and rape her as she was put under paralysis. However, Guan Yu managed to remain rational and did not take his sworn brother's concubine for himself. He and Qilan made preparations to leave Cao Cao after he knew Liu Bei's whereabouts from a messenger sent by Liu Bei himself. Cao Cao's followers strongly opposed his decision to let Guan Yu leave, as they felt that Guan might become a threat to their lord in the future. Despite this, Cao Cao gave a strict order that no one was to stop Guan Yu. However, along the way, Guan Yu encountered resistance and had to fight his way through the passes. Guan Yu slew Kong Xiu, Han Fu, Meng Tan, Bian Xi, Wang Zhi and Qin Qi, consecutively after they attempted to stop him.

Jocko takes all bets, even after Ginger warns him he cannot cover them all if Nipper loses. Mary  graduates and returns home. In the title fight, Nipper is holding his own until he is sent crashing out of the ring. When he gets back in, he realizes he has injured his shoulder and cannot use one arm. Nevertheless, knowing Jocko's financial peril, Nipper knocks out the champion. Afterward, the doctor informs Jocko privately that Nipper may never be able to fight again, but Jocko keeps this from his boy. With his profits, Jocko buys an isolated hotel in Northern Australia, where Nipper recuperates. Local priest Father Ploycarp  believes he can heal Nipper's shoulder.

Without animosity, Larsen tells the deputy that he will use his time in prison to plan more bank robberies. This new robbery would be foolproof as Larsen feels that he was only caught by using a partner; the next time will be singlehanded. Boarding the train, Larsen overpowers the deputy, takes his pistol and handcuffs one of his arms to the guardrail on the rear car of the train. Suddenly, Larsen's younger brother Danny  unexpectedly comes from the train to free Larsen, even though Larsen was handling his escape fine. The elder Larsen chides Danny that he does not need help from anyone. Danny explains that he has brought Jim a horse, and they flee. As they ride off the deputy produces a hidden derringer from an ankle holster, aiming at them. He mortally wounds Danny who kills the deputy. The two board another train by hiding in the baggage car. Jim explains his escape plans to Danny enroute, but Danny dies. Jim places his brother's corpse in a mail sack and throws it off a bridge passing over a river and vows to be alone in the future. The train's first stop is the Enterprize Mine  where Jim changes into his father's business suit which Danny brought, and Jim reboards the train as a passenger. The only vacant seat is next to Alice  a six year old girl who has been visiting her grandfather who is the Marshall at the Enterprize Mine. The talkative Alice guesses that as she does not recognise Jim, he must be a visiting mining inspector. Using the name Ray Kincaid, Larsen plays along with her guess and gathers information on the next town, Tangle Blue, Wyoming. Mark Riley , an earnest but inexperienced sheriff who is young Alice's uncle, and a group of deputies stop the train to search for the deputy's murderer, but they are satisfied with ""Ray Kincaid the mining inspector"" due to his travelling with Alice. The deputies say that the wanted poster depicting the deputy's murderer with Jim Larsen's face will be arriving on the next day's train and everyone will be checked entering or leaving the town. Larsen/Kincaid arrives in town, meeting Alice's mother, the widow Ellen Bailey ([[Dorothy Green . Uncle Mark is having problems with rich landowner Reed Williams ([[Alan Baxter  fencing off what he thinks is his land but which the government declares open range. Larsen/Kincaid uses his remaining money to have a shave then buy a horse and tack, a set of work clothes, and a pistol, belt and ammunition to replace the pistol he threw away during the search on the train. Larsen/Kincaid finds all the roads away from Tangle Blue are guarded by deputies who are preventing anyone leave the town until the wanted posters come in. Returning to town and desperate for cash, he decides to earn some money as being a deputy for Mark. Larsen/Kincaid attends a dance with Ellen who wants to leave Tangle Blue. He proves his worth by stopping a showdown between Williams' gang and Mark. Escorting her and Alice home, they pass some deputies who have discovered Danny's unidentified body in the sack that the river has brought to town. Though Larsen/Kincaid tries to avoid getting involved with Ellen, they fall in love. As part of his duties in enforcing the law, Mark cuts down Williams' barbed wire fences, that Williams' gang of toughs re-construct. Sheriff Mark reminds Larsen/Kincaid of Danny, and Mark is being menaced by Williams and his gang who threaten to kill Mark if he cuts down their fence one more time. Returning to town to drink, Williams and his gang menace Larsen/Kincaid who responds by beating up Williams, but Larsen/Kincaid is soon worked over by his Williams' gang. The next day Larsen/Kincaid is the only deputy willing to go with Mark to cut down Williams' fence. Mark cuts down the fence then returns to town to meet the train arriving with the posters depicting the face of the fugitive leaving Larsen/Kincaid to watch the fence. Though having the chance to escape, he notices one of Williams' toughs Purdy  repairing the fence. Larsen re-cuts the barbed wire by shooting the strands with his Winchester rifle that sets the strands to wrap around Purdy. He singlehandedly takes on Williams and his gang."

When a flaming desert is nearly spilled onto the trio, Monk informs them that it was meant for him. He explains that, according to a prophesy, he is to die in three days. Upon learning their profession, he hires them to protect him, particularly from a man with a peg leg and a valise, the latter  to transport his decapitated head to the ancient secret society of the Barokan. The leader of the society, Mr. Gee , has offered to buy Monk's head  because he looks exactly like the ancient mummified founder of his order. When the two trail Monk and his woman companion, Jean Anderson , out into the night, the one-legged man does approach, but eludes their efforts to catch him. As Packard delves into the mystery, he comes to suspect that someone is trying to drive Monk into committing suicide after he learns that Monk's two million dollar inheritance will go to charity if he divorces his wheelchair-bound wife Ellen . Along with Ellen, the suspects include her physician, Dr. Han ; her nurse ; her lover, Justin Reeves; Jean; and the minions of the society. Then the one-legged man has his throat cut. He is identified as Jean's father. Jean and Reeves soon suffer the same fate. It turns out that all of Monk's acquaintances, led by his wife, are plotting his death. However, he found out by bribing Dr. Han and started killing them off one by one. Fearing that Packard and Long will eventually figure out the identity of the murderer, Monk tries to dispatch them as well, but they manage to foil his scheme. Unmasked, Monk flees in his car, only to have a crash result in his decapitation.

Someone is trying to break into his apartment, as he prepares himself in tears to jump off the roof. 3 months earlier, Eddie is a New York City author struggling with writer's block with a deadline looming, and struggling after being dumped by his girlfriend Lindy . One day, Eddie comes across Vernon Gant , the brother of his ex-wife, Melissa Gant . Vernon, a drug dealer, offers Eddie a nootropic drug, NZT-48, claiming it allows the user to access 100% of their brain's capacity instead of the ""usual"" 20%. After some convincing, Eddie accepts the pill and arrives home. Eddie takes one dose in front of his apartment and finds the claim is true; with his heightened brain activity, he realizes that his neighbour studies law from a book that he remembered from college that he saw in her hand, and helps her write 50 pages of her report assignment. He arrives in his apartment and completes 90 pages of the book for his delighted publisher, but is concerned that he has little recollection of the time he was under the influence of the drug. Vernon makes Eddie complete mundane tasks in exchange for more of the drug; when Eddie returns to Vernon's apartment after one errand, he finds Vernon shot dead and the apartment ransacked. He quickly finds Vernon's stash of NZT-48, a small amount of cash, and a book of addresses, which he takes before the police arrive. Eddie, using NZT-48, quickly finishes the book but believes he is capable of much more with the drug. He finds the ability to identify trends in the stock market, and is able to quadruple investments on a daily basis. Seeking to grow a fortune quickly, he obtains a short term loan of $100,000 from Russian mafia thug, Gennady , which he is able to turn into $2 million in a few days at a ""trading arcade""; though he knows he has drawn media attention, he is troubled by a man in a tan coat  that appears to be following him. Eddie is able to rekindle his relation with Lindy during this time. Eddie's success leads to a meeting with the powerful businessman, Carl Van Loon , who wants Eddie's advice the next day on a proposed merger with a competitor, Hank Atwood . Eddie spends the day influenced by NZT, drinking and partying heavily, and eventually coming to his senses in a hotel room with a blonde woman . Worried about having no memories of the past day, he quickly leaves, followed by the man in the tan coat. Eddie meets with Van Loon the next day, having not yet taken a look at the assignment nor a dose of NZT, but as they discuss it, Eddie realizes that Atwood may also be a NZT user based on his sudden rise in wealth. Just then, a news reports breaks that the woman Eddie was with the night before was found murdered. Worried about his sudden sicknesses, Eddie talks to Melissa, who was a former user of the drug, who explains that quitting NZT cold turkey has extreme side effects, with nausea, vomiting, headaches, which is only the beginning, and instead that Eddie should reduce his dosage slowly; even still, two years since quitting the drug has left Melissa sluggish and lazy. Eddie returns home but is accosted by Gennady, who takes his last NZT pill giving time for Eddie to get the funds to repay Gennady. Eddie tells Lindy that he had stored a stash of the drug at her apartment and asks her to bring it over; as she does, she is followed by the man in the tan coat. Eddie convinces her to take one pill, giving her heightened awareness to injure the man and escape; though she returns the stash to Eddie, she fears what he's become with the drug and leaves him again. Eddie works on reducing his dosage to manageable levels to avoid complete memory blackouts. He continues to build his wealth, hires bodyguards to protect him, and pays a laboratory to try to reverse engineer NZT. Also, the Russian mobster found out about the drug and now he is blackmailing Eddie to get the drug. Eddie aids Van Loon in the merger deal, who promises Eddie $40 million if the deal goes through. Meanwhile, Eddie is marked as a suspect in the murder case; he hires a top attorney Morris Brandt  to help defend him. Worried for his safety, Eddie buys a highly secured penthouse safehouse. On the day of signing the merger, Atwood's wife shows up instead and announces that Atwood had fallen into a coma, though confides that Atwood still wants the deal to go through. As Eddie and Van Loon escort her back to her car, Eddie recognizes the driver as the man in the tan coat, and realizes that Atwood was trying to get his stash of NZT from Eddie. Later, Eddie is required to participate in a line-up for the murder, while Brandt holds his custom-made jacket. Eddie is not recognized by the witness and is let off as a suspect, but later he discovers that the stash of his NZT in his jacket has gone missing. He realizes that Brandt took the stash from his coat when he sees him on television as Atwood's attorney. As Eddie starts withdrawals in his safehouse, Gennady and his henchmen try to break in looking for more NZT. Eddie contemplates jumping to end it all , but remembers he may have one more pill. He finds it just as the Russians break in, causing him to drop the pill into a grate. Gennady demonstrates that he has found a way to take NZT directly by injecting a solution of it into his blood by a syringe, and he started an import-export business. Eddie uses the moment and attacks Gennady, killing him with a kitchen knife. Desperately needing NZT, but with no pills to hand, Eddie resorts to drinking Gennady's blood to successfully regain his enhanced faculties. One of the henchman returns to find him and the corpse, but Eddie blinds the Russians' eyes by using a syringe needle as a blowdart. He then tricks the blinded goon into killing his sidekick by impersonating the second henchman , before eventually killing the blinded Russian. Later, learning that Atwood died, Eddie convinces the man in the tan coat of Brandt's deception, and the two recover Eddie's stash of NZT from Brandt's residence. A year later, Eddie has remained wealthy, his book has hit the market, and he is running for the United States Senate. Van Loon visits him, initially as a friend, but soon reveals he has bought the company that made NZT and closed down the laboratory Eddie had hired to make it, seeking to provide Eddie with an unlimited supply in exchange for political favors to escape from the law. Eddie surprises Van Loon by revealing that he has been several steps ahead; not only had he hired multiple laboratories to work on NZT, but he himself has been able to wean himself off the drug while retaining his acute mental abilities. He recognizes that Van Loon has a terminal heart condition and will die soon, and he escorts him back in his car. Later on, Eddie meets with Lindy in a Chinese restaurant. He orders his meal speaking Mandarin with the waiter. Eddie realizes that Lindy is staring at him. ""What?"" he asks. Then the credits roll."

Van Loon visits him, initially as a friend, but soon reveals he has bought the company that made NZT and closed down the laboratory Eddie had hired to make it, seeking to provide Eddie with an unlimited supply in exchange for political favors to escape from the law. Eddie surprises Van Loon by revealing that he has been several steps ahead; not only had he hired multiple laboratories to work on NZT, but he himself has been able to wean himself off the drug while retaining his acute mental abilities. He recognizes that Van Loon has a terminal heart condition and will die soon, and he escorts him back in his car. Later on, Eddie meets with Lindy in a Chinese restaurant.

Someone is trying to break into his apartment, as he prepares himself in tears to jump off the roof. 3 months earlier, Eddie is a New York City author struggling with writer's block with a deadline looming, and struggling after being dumped by his girlfriend Lindy . One day, Eddie comes across Vernon Gant , the brother of his ex-wife, Melissa Gant . Vernon, a drug dealer, offers Eddie a nootropic drug, NZT-48, claiming it allows the user to access 100% of their brain's capacity instead of the ""usual"" 20%. After some convincing, Eddie accepts the pill and arrives home. Eddie takes one dose in front of his apartment and finds the claim is true; with his heightened brain activity, he realizes that his neighbour studies law from a book that he remembered from college that he saw in her hand, and helps her write 50 pages of her report assignment. He arrives in his apartment and completes 90 pages of the book for his delighted publisher, but is concerned that he has little recollection of the time he was under the influence of the drug. Vernon makes Eddie complete mundane tasks in exchange for more of the drug; when Eddie returns to Vernon's apartment after one errand, he finds Vernon shot dead and the apartment ransacked. He quickly finds Vernon's stash of NZT-48, a small amount of cash, and a book of addresses, which he takes before the police arrive. Eddie, using NZT-48, quickly finishes the book but believes he is capable of much more with the drug. He finds the ability to identify trends in the stock market, and is able to quadruple investments on a daily basis. Seeking to grow a fortune quickly, he obtains a short term loan of $100,000 from Russian mafia thug, Gennady , which he is able to turn into $2 million in a few days at a ""trading arcade""; though he knows he has drawn media attention, he is troubled by a man in a tan coat  that appears to be following him. Eddie is able to rekindle his relation with Lindy during this time. Eddie's success leads to a meeting with the powerful businessman, Carl Van Loon , who wants Eddie's advice the next day on a proposed merger with a competitor, Hank Atwood . Eddie spends the day influenced by NZT, drinking and partying heavily, and eventually coming to his senses in a hotel room with a blonde woman . Worried about having no memories of the past day, he quickly leaves, followed by the man in the tan coat. Eddie meets with Van Loon the next day, having not yet taken a look at the assignment nor a dose of NZT, but as they discuss it, Eddie realizes that Atwood may also be a NZT user based on his sudden rise in wealth. Just then, a news reports breaks that the woman Eddie was with the night before was found murdered. Worried about his sudden sicknesses, Eddie talks to Melissa, who was a former user of the drug, who explains that quitting NZT cold turkey has extreme side effects, with nausea, vomiting, headaches, which is only the beginning, and instead that Eddie should reduce his dosage slowly; even still, two years since quitting the drug has left Melissa sluggish and lazy. Eddie returns home but is accosted by Gennady, who takes his last NZT pill giving time for Eddie to get the funds to repay Gennady. Eddie tells Lindy that he had stored a stash of the drug at her apartment and asks her to bring it over; as she does, she is followed by the man in the tan coat. Eddie convinces her to take one pill, giving her heightened awareness to injure the man and escape; though she returns the stash to Eddie, she fears what he's become with the drug and leaves him again. Eddie works on reducing his dosage to manageable levels to avoid complete memory blackouts. He continues to build his wealth, hires bodyguards to protect him, and pays a laboratory to try to reverse engineer NZT. Also, the Russian mobster found out about the drug and now he is blackmailing Eddie to get the drug. Eddie aids Van Loon in the merger deal, who promises Eddie $40 million if the deal goes through. Meanwhile, Eddie is marked as a suspect in the murder case; he hires a top attorney Morris Brandt  to help defend him. Worried for his safety, Eddie buys a highly secured penthouse safehouse. On the day of signing the merger, Atwood's wife shows up instead and announces that Atwood had fallen into a coma, though confides that Atwood still wants the deal to go through. As Eddie and Van Loon escort her back to her car, Eddie recognizes the driver as the man in the tan coat, and realizes that Atwood was trying to get his stash of NZT from Eddie. Later, Eddie is required to participate in a line-up for the murder, while Brandt holds his custom-made jacket. Eddie is not recognized by the witness and is let off as a suspect, but later he discovers that the stash of his NZT in his jacket has gone missing. He realizes that Brandt took the stash from his coat when he sees him on television as Atwood's attorney. As Eddie starts withdrawals in his safehouse, Gennady and his henchmen try to break in looking for more NZT. Eddie contemplates jumping to end it all , but remembers he may have one more pill. He finds it just as the Russians break in, causing him to drop the pill into a grate. Gennady demonstrates that he has found a way to take NZT directly by injecting a solution of it into his blood by a syringe, and he started an import-export business. Eddie uses the moment and attacks Gennady, killing him with a kitchen knife. Desperately needing NZT, but with no pills to hand, Eddie resorts to drinking Gennady's blood to successfully regain his enhanced faculties. One of the henchman returns to find him and the corpse, but Eddie blinds the Russians' eyes by using a syringe needle as a blowdart. He then tricks the blinded goon into killing his sidekick by impersonating the second henchman , before eventually killing the blinded Russian.

As a thief, he only pulls off the most difficult heists that offer the biggest rewards. Gasback's trio of henchmen, however, are tired from the increasing danger and expense of each successive job and decide to seize the winnings from his latest heist at Macca City, kill Gasback and retire to a life of luxury. When Cain, the leader of the trio goes to fire the killing shot, his gun is mysteriously knocked out of his hand... Vash the Stampede appears from underneath a counter where he had been cowering and immediately throws the thieves off guard with his odd behavior and complaints about ruining his donuts. Gasback attempts to shoot down his former companions as they run away, but Vash manages to throw his aim off and no one is killed. Police begin to circle the building just as it is revealed that Vash is the legendary ""Humanoid Typhoon."" Gasback is confused why he would want to try to save even robbers and Vash responds in his usual way telling him that it's better to be alive. Gasback ultimately escapes the police by using a barrage of explosives for cover, one of which damages the city's power Plant. 20 years later the movie picks up with Gasback's former henchmen who had been living luxuriously on the money they had stolen. Gasback has taken revenge on one of them, destroying his business and property and leaving him to seek refuge with Cain Kepler. Cain used his portion of the robbery money to repair the city's Plant that was damaged by Gasback's escape and became Mayor. His vanity culminates in a huge rotating statue in his image built in the center of the city. Fearing Gasback will try to steal it, he insures the statue for $$5 billion double-dollars prompting Milly Thompson and Meryl Stryfe to travel to Macca City to run risk prevention. Vash travels to the city aboard a sand steamer and intervenes in an escalating brawl with some thugs harassing a young woman named Amelia. She is appreciative of Vash's assistance, but spurns his over-the-top advances . Amelia is actually a bounty hunter who has traveled to Macca City in anticipation of Gasback's appearance. Over the years the thief has accrued a $$300 million double-dollar bounty and Amelia is only one of a great number of bounty hunters gathering to take a shot at bringing the criminal down. Meanwhile, Gasback continues planning his revenge and is ambushed by police who open fire on the bar he is playing poker in and level it to the ground. Gasback is shielded from the gunfire by his bodyguard who turns out to be Nicholas D. Wolfwood. Gasback discovered the priest dying of thirst in the middle of the desert  near a water vending machine that wouldn't accept his crumpled bills. Feeling indebted to the thief, Wolfwood agrees to act as his bodyguard, but not actively participate in the robbery against Cain. Vash continues trying to unsuccessfully court Amelia and they end up at dinner with Milly and Meryl. A brawl breaks out and afterward Vash carries the inebriated Amelia back to their hotel. That night Gasback attacks and destroys a factory owned by the second henchmen at a nearby town, leaving him to seek refuge with Cain and word spreads that the rumored attack on Macca City was a hoax. The bounty hunters, including Amelia, begin to leave the city early the next morning just as Gasback arrives. The bounty hunters, most of them nursing hangovers from drinking the night before, offer little resistance and soon Gasback fights his way to Cain's doorstep where he is halted by Vash. Wolfwood orders Vash to let Gasback pass and opens fire, distracting him just long enough for the thief to get inside the mansion. With his contract complete, Wolfwood puts his gun away allowing Vash to chase Gasback inside. Gasback confronts Cain just as Vash and Amelia arrive. Vash hopes to defuse the situation while Amelia aims to kill Gasback. Amelia learns that Vash was the one who allowed Gasback to escape from the botched robbery 20 years ago. During Vash's interruption Cain manages to escape and once again Vash allows Gasback to leave despite Amelia's protests. She tells Vash that because he saved Gasback 20 years ago countless lives were affected by his robberies including her own life and her mother's who suffered because of the thief. She swears to chase him down and take revenge. Elsewhere in the city Gasback confronts Cain once again and explains to his betrayer that he's not going to kill him, but instead steal everything that belongs to him. Cain had believed the target of the theft was his statue, but in fact the object is far more valuable. Gasback sets off a string of explosions which separate the city's Plant from its cradle and the massive light-bulb like Plant rolls through the town past dumbstruck citizens straight to the city's main gates where a special getaway vehicle secures the Plant and drives away. Amelia immediately takes a vehicle and chases after Gasback and she is followed by Vash and Wolfwood. She catches up to Gasback and starts shooting coming dangerously close to hitting the Plant. Vash and Wolfwood pull up between them and Vash tries to clam Amelia down, but he is shot by one of Gasback's henchmen and falls into a pit of quicksand. Wolfwood leaps in after him to save him, but only manages to pull up Vash's sunglasses. They take the sad news back to Milly and Meryl in the now darkened city and Amelia starts to think that she's no better than Gasback. The following day Amelia enlists Wolfwood  to help track down Gasback and reclaim the Plant. They attack the thief’s caravan, but are quickly outmaneuvered. Just as one of Gasback's men moves to shoot Amelia, the gun is shot out of his hand by Vash, who reappears without a scratch. The bullet that struck him lodged in an extremely tough piece of smoked meat he was carrying in his coat pocket . Gasback then challenges him to a duel and Vash handily defeats him with a shot to the leg and shoulder. Gasback then activates a secret energy-based weapon, but Amelia steps forward and reveals a strange mechanical glove she wears which counters the weapon. Gasback recognizes the glove immediately as something he made for his wife, Amelia's mother. Amelia explains she was born shortly after Gasback left home to commit another robbery. The thief left his wife well-provisioned, but rival thieves came and stole almost everything they owned and none of their neighbors would help the family of the notorious criminal Gasback and not even doctors would help when Amelia's mother lay dying. Amelia holds the gun on him, but ultimately decides to spare his life having adopted Vash's outlook. A disheveled Cain arrives on the scene with a gaudy missile bearing his face which Wolfwood dispatches with a single shot from his Cross Punisher. Gasback, his henchmen and his former henchmen including Cain are all taken into custody and Amelia is last shown following the police caravan from a distance before driving off. Vash and Wolfwood discuss the events of the last few days, including the coincidence that Amelia wouldn't have been born if Vash hadn't save Gasback 20 years ago, as they leave the city. The movie ends with a newspaper clipping which blows past with the headline that the Dodongo Brothers have escaped prison. Wolfwood interprets Vash’s silent detachment as a sign that the legendary outlaw has something to do with the Brothers as well…"

Deborah  comes from New York and is slim, elegant, and very well-dressed. She clearly likes Harry and they fall in love.

After several months of having their marriage plans sabotaged, one Sunday, Harry and Deborah plan to run off to New York and just get married that evening. However their plan is thwarted when Lettie collapses and is taken to hospital. Deborah makes Harry choose: Lettie or her. He chooses his sister and they part, seemingly forever.

Heading to her basement to attempt suicide, she curses the hidden tormentor and refuses to give them the satisfaction of seeing her hang herself; but as she tries to remove the noose from her neck, the stool beneath her is kicked away, leaving her to die. Miles away, Sara's twin sister Julia collapses at work, sensing something amiss with her sister. After driving to Sara's house, Julia and her husband Isaac find Sara hanged. The police suspect no foul play, deciding that Sara was depressed after turning blind due to a degenerative eye disease that is slowly robbing Julia's vision as well. Julia, however, is unconvinced, believing that somebody else was in the house at the time of Sara's death, after finding Dusty Springfield's 'The Look of Love' in Sara's record player, a song her sister apparently hated. After feeling a hand that was not Isaac's on her shoulder while laying flowers on Sara's grave at her funeral, Julia becomes paranoid that the 'invisible man' who played a hand in Sara's death is nearby. After speaking to Sara's blind neighbour, Soledad, Julia visits the Baumann Centre for the Blind to learn more about Sara's life shortly before her death. She wanders into a women's locker room and overhears a group of women discussing her sister. She learns that Sara had a boyfriend with whom she had spent the weekend in a hotel. When the blind women sense her presence and surround her, they ask who is the man that entered with her: confused, she tells them she came alone, to which the women respond that a man came with her and is standing behind her. Only glimpsing the man's shadow as he flees, Julia chases him through the dark basement, but he escapes her and the stress causes an attack of blindness. Returning to Sara's house, she finds a mysterious key and the receipt for Sara's stay in the Hotel Bella Vista before being confronted by Isaac, who berates her for 'chasing ghosts' and is concerned that the stress will cause her sight to deteriorate faster. Julia persuades him to spend the night in a hotel with her, claiming that she wants to take their minds off what has happened, and they travel to the Hotel Bella Vista. There, Julia finds that the details of Sara's boyfriend have been apparently cleared from the hotel's records, though a waiter mistakes her for Sara and lets slip that her sister's eyes were covered by bandages during her stay. Julia confronts Isaac, who tells her that their doctor had confided in him that the operation Julia believed Sara was waiting for in the hopes of regaining her sight -thereby ruling out suicide, since her sister was waiting for an eye donor - had failed. During their argument, Julia suffers another attack of blindness and is nearly hit by a car; at which Isaac is distraught as he realises his wife's vision is rapidly failing her. They reconcile and make love.  The following morning, Julia is approached by a janitor who warns her of 'men who live in shadows' and informs her that the parking lot where Sara's mysterious boyfriend kept his van was under 24-hour surveillance. Julia's eyes are examined, and her doctor informs her that she may only have weeks or months left before she goes blind. Despite his exasperation, Julia persuades Isaac to go to the parking lot where Sara's boyfriend's van was kept in the hope of catching him on tape. Julia waits in the car as Isaac goes to collect the tape; however, he does not return and Julia ventures into the dark parking lot alone. The guard confirms that Isaac entered and took the tape, but he has not been seen since. A sudden power cut plunges them into darkness, and when the lights come back on the security camera cables have been slashed.  Julia is convinced that the 'invisible man' stole the tape, sabotaged the cameras and has kidnapped Isaac, though the police are skeptical. Returning to the Hotel Romero to question the janitor, they find him electrocuted in the bath from a fallen light above the water: however, the police declare it accidental. Isaac's credit card is found to have been used in a nearby hotel, however, when Julia and the inspector return to the house to look for any sign of his return; another power cut sends Julia stumbling through the darkness, brushing against what appears to be a man in the basement where Sara died. Upstairs, the inspector finds a note left on the bed, before being alerted by Julia's screams. When he arrives with his torch, Isaac's corpse is found swinging from the spot where Sara died; with Julia cowering, unable to see at all - her vision has gone completely. At the hospital, the police inform a grieving Julia that the note found on the bed was written in Isaac's hand, declaring that he could not live without Sara, with whom he had been having an affair for six months. However, an eye donor is found, so the operation to save Julia's sight goes ahead. She is told she must wear bandages to protect her eyes for two weeks, and returns to Sara's house despite her doctor's protests with a day carer, Iván, to assist her. Strangely, the key she found, which she believes was left by Sara's boyfriend, has disappeared. At first, Julia is plagued by disorientation and nightmares while convinced that somebody is lurking in the house; but Iván's patience and coaching help her regain her independence. Four days before Julia is due to remove her bandages, a starlit dinner culminates in a kiss, after which Iván leaves hurriedly, uncomfortable. That night, an unseen man almost succeeds in drugging Julia while she sleeps; however, she wakes, panicked, and accidentally hits the intruder as she sits upright. Terrified, she flees to the house of Sara's neighbour, Señor Blasco, who makes advances on her: as she turns to escape his house, she finds the key she had lost hanging on the wall - believing that Blasco is the 'invisible man', she escapes, paging Iván, who finds her hiding outside in the rain and escorts her to his apartment. In Iván's home, while he goes to get his spare bed for him to sleep in, Julia hears the voice of Blasco's shy daughter Lía, who tells her that her nurse - Iván - is the 'invisible man' who tormented Sara, has walls covered with photographs of Julia and her twin, and now seeks to drug her with sedatives slipped into her tea. Lía tells Julia to meet her in the bathroom moments before Iván returns. Conflicted, Julia goes to the bathroom where, four days early, she tears off her bandages, desperate to see for herself if Lía's word is true. A sudden bang causes Iván to come looking for her. Still in the bathroom, she replies that she heard it as well but did not know what it was. Iván heads out of the apartment momentarily. Julia exits the bathroom and sees Iván's walls are covered with photographs of the twins as well as Lía's bloodied body that is held to the wall with a kitchen knife through her mouth. Iván returns to the apartment to find Julia sobbing in the room with Lia. She pretends that she is crying because her operation has failed and she is blind which he believes. Behind Iván's back, she swaps her drugged tea for his; however, he guesses what has happened and leads her to a chest freezer where the body of the real nurse Iván is hidden. Julia's scream betrays the fact that she can see the corpse, and her ruse is over. Terrified, Julia suffers another attack of blindness. When her vision returns, Iván has driven Julia back to Sara's house, where she escapes and flees to the house of Señora Soledad. 'Iván' pursues her into the house and addresses Soledad as 'Máma', revealing himself as her missing son Ángel. A candle and pair of reading glasses betray the fact that Soledad is not in fact blind as she knocks Julia out, at which an enraged Ángel almost strangles his mother and injects her eye with a substance designed to break down the optic nerve and render her blind again. Julia awakens in the basement of Sara's house, where Ángel tells her he loves her and wants them to be together as long as her sight is gone; since blind people are the only ones who sense the existence of a man who lives in shadows. Julia steals his knife and stabs him as he kisses her, before fleeing. As he chases her, Julia finds all the doors and windows locked. She calls the inspector to ask for help, but Ángel cuts the telephone cable from downstairs during the conversation. As Ángel breaks free of the locked basement, she cuts the fuse and plunges the house into darkness. By the flashbulb of his camera, Ángel hunts Julia through the house and finally pins her down to strangle her. Julia desperately reaches for his dropped camera as he lifts the knife to stab her. She blocks the stab with the camera. The police arrive as Julia breaks free. She uses a flashlight to show the police a bloodied Ángel hiding in a corner of the room. Finally visible, he is defeated, and slits his own throat while begging the police not to look at him.  At the hospital once more, Julia is told the damage to her new eyes is irreversible and she will not see the dawn. Using her last few hours of vision, she goes to say goodbye to Isaac's corpse, where it is revealed that he donated his eyes to her.

The comedy would ensue as each career they tried would eventually turn into a fiasco, In the pilot they try their hand as interior decorators. In their office, they meet a new client, Mr. Pennyfeather . Just a few moments after Pennyfeather arrives, Shemp accidentally spills ink down the front of Pennyfeather's suit, who becomes enraged. The Stooges then challenge Pennyfeather to mischief with them, featuring the famous ""Texas"" routine. After the some slapstick mayhem, they are successful in tossing Mr. Pennyfeather out of the office. Suddenly, the next client calls him on the phone for them to come in to manage her house. In her house, The Stooges not only hang wallpaper, but also manage to trash their client's home. Unfortunately, that woman is Mrs. Pennyfeather  and that house is Mr. Pennyfeather's house. After Mr. Pennyfeather comes home, the Stooges cover Mr. Pennyfeather with wallpaper and both Mr. Pennyfeather and the Stooges recognize each other . In a rage, both Pennyfeathers attack the boys with their own paint and utensils. In the end, Moe, Larry, and Shemp, defeated, hang up their brushes."

Scenes include their emotional goodbyes as well as a party with a striptease dancer. They are posted for a six month tour at Armadillo, a military base in Helmand province, Afghanistan, where some 270 Danish and British soldiers are based. The film shows the soldiers going out on patrol. They hand out candy and gifts to the children. They question a local man about the Taliban who declines to cooperate and they return to base without incident. The film depicts them as dividing their leisure time between maintaining their equipment and working out, calling home, playing shooter games and watching pornographic videos amongst other things.

Some locals receive compensations from the base.  A Danish commander becomes a victim of a roadside bomb and is evacuated to receive treatment for a skull fracture.

A hand grenade is tossed into the ditch followed by the order to 'neutralize them' and subsequent sporadic gunfire is heard. Five Taliban are killed and there are graphic scenes of their bodies being pulled from the ditch and stripped of their weapons.

Philippe and Martha welcome Elizabeth lavishly, then reveal the real reason for the celebration of her arrival: her betrothal, unknown to Elizabeth, between her and her cousin, Andre Swann. John Rambeau, obviously disliked by matriarch Martha, arrives at the party, flirts with Elizabeth and leads her out into the vineyards, where he mischievously reveals Rambeau family secrets: Philippe uses marriage to tighten the family hold on the valley; Phillipe's sister Martha and daughter Charlotte  had been married off to local landowners in order to increase the vineyard holdings &mdash; Phillipe now wants to marry off grand-daughter Elizabeth to Andre in order to absorb the Stag's Leap Winery . Continuing his explanation, John points out his house nearby, where his invalid mother Charlotte now lives, and says that he now knows that Martha's husband  is his real father, even though everyone claims that Charlotte's late husband had been the biological father to both John and his sister Monica. John then takes the speechless Elizabeth into his arms and kisses her, but she pulls away and runs into the house. The next day, John gets into an argument with Philippe by insisting that they ignore Prohibition laws and sell their grapes  to bootleggers. Philippe, who loves John, insists on remaining lawful, explaining once again how he will continue to cultivate and study wines until the time comes to sell them legally. John volunteers to show Elizabeth around the winery, bitterly pointing out the vast stores of wine going to waste. When he asks her about her past and tries to kiss her again, she once again pulls away. As they wander the estate, one of the female workers, Buz Dietrick, flirts with John. Back at the house, Martha spirits Elizabeth away to a lunch with Andre, who is quite comfortable with the idea of an arranged marriage. Meeting with the local association of grape growers, John tells them that he will make them rich by selling their grapes to a syndicate in Chicago. Some of the traditional growers insist on gaining Philippe's approval first. Ignoring them, John leaves for Chicago to meet with the syndicate &mdash; soon after, thugs arrive in the Napa Valley and force the growers to sign contracts. When John returns to Napa months later, the growers, now grown rich from John's arrangement with the Chicago syndicate, welcome him warmly. John meets the growers at a nightclub, where he finds Buz sitting with her boyfriend, Luigi Griffanti. They all watch Elizabeth and Andre  dance. John once again romances Elizabeth, who, hoping to dissuade his interest, reveals to him that her father had sent her away from England because she had been involved in a torrid love affair with a cruel man, and she now desires a safe marriage with Andre. A jealous John accuses her of ""prostituting"" herself for real estate, and she slaps him. John then turns to Buz for comfort, convincing her to leave Luigi and drive off with him. Later, Andre drives Elizabeth home, where he confesses that he is growing to love her. Inside, Martha, aware of Elizabeth's ambivalent feelings over John, confronts her about her past, urging her to marry Andre before he realizes he is getting ""damaged goods."" John returns home and tells his mother he will leave the next day for Chicago. The next day Elizabeth, having had a change of heart, races off to see John before his train leaves &mdash; she finds him at the station and tells him she loves him. Thrilled, John insists that she wait for his return. A few months later, a pregnant Buz shows up at the estate to inform Phillipe that the baby is John's &mdash; Buz and her father blackmail Philippe. Elizabeth, nearby, hears all, and collapses with grief. Martha directs Buz to tell Luigi the baby is his. Buz and Luigi soon marry, but she fights with both him and his mother when they want to name the baby Cesare, and she wants to name the baby ... John. Months pass. Martha tries to convince an impatient Andre to wait for Elizabeth to set a wedding date. When John finally returns to Napa Valley, Elizabeth is up in the mountain orchard with Philippe, listening to him explain that this is sacred ground to him, as it was his first plot of land, and his beloved wife is buried here. At the estate, Martha greets John coldly and warns him that he must now conduct business through her, because Philippe is ill. After successfully persuading Martha that they can make millions by selling the Rambeau grapes to the Chicago syndicate, John drives to the mountain orchard. There, Philippe, horrified by John's shady dealings, commands him to leave, as does Elizabeth, who tells him she knows the truth about Buz's baby. Protesting that he can prove that Buz has lied, John races away, accidentally throwing a lit cigarette into the parched fields, starting a blaze. By the time the fire is noticed, it is too late, and the out-of-control wildfire destroys most of the mountain orchard. Unaware of the fire, John rushes to Buz's house, where mother-in-law Griffanti, upon hearing John's name, figures out that John is her grandson's actual father. As Buz agrees that she will tell Elizabeth that the baby is not John's, Luigi, at his mother's urging, attacks John in a jealous rage. John manages to get away, but Luigi pulls out a gun and shoots him. At the hospital, John is diagnosed with temporary partial paralysis &mdash; when Elizabeth visits to beg his forgiveness, he turns away from her bitterly. Soon, he is able to walk with crutches, and returns home, where he tells his uncle Francis and mother Charlotte that he knows about their affair, which resulted in his birth. John takes the blame for the orchard fire &mdash; in return, he forgives the two of them for their deceit, and asks for their forgiveness in exchange. Months later, Philippe dies, and matriarch Martha gathers the family together for the reading of the will. To Martha's shock and dismay, Philippe has divided the estate equally between his children and grandchildren &mdash; he also leaves the mountain orchard to John, the valley vineyards to the still-unmarried Elizabeth, and nothing to Martha. Although Martha is greatly pained by what she sees as an injustice, both she and her husband Francis realize that now she will finally be more interested in her husband and her marriage, instead of the family business. Within a few weeks, John has restored his mountain orchard to health. One day, Elizabeth joins him with a gift: a grape vine cutting from her valley vineyard. They graft the valley cutting onto a mountain vine, talk about the melding of ""valley sweetness"" with ""mountain strength"", and, finally, fall into each other's arms, declaring their love for each other."

Martin lives with his suicidal mother who constantly yells at him and blames him for having his father put in prison for both physically and sexually abusing Martin when he was a boy. Dr. Sebring, Martin's psychiatrist, also touches him inappropriately and prescribes heavy medication. Martin acquires a dingy, dimly-lit warehouse after killing the lessor and begins abducting people from the car park to use as for his own human centipede by knocking them unconscious with a crowbar, then binding their hands and feet with tape and driving them to the warehouse. The film chronicles Martin kidnapping his victims which include: an aggressive young man and his girlfriend, two drunk girls who catch Martin masturbating with sandpaper, a dad and his pregnant wife, and a man who complains about the ATM having no cash. Martin catches Dr. Sebring and a cabbie having sex with a prostitute, and proceeds to kill Sebring and abduct the cabbie and prostitute. When Martin's mother finds his scrapbook, Martin kills her by bludgeoning her head several times with his crowbar, after which he takes her corpse and sets it at the dinner table and eats across from it . Martin's last victim is Ashlynn Yennie, the actress who played Jenny in the first film . With twelve victims, Martin begins assembling his ""centipede"". Martin severs the tendons in each person's knees to prevent them from fleeing and uses a hammer to knock out their teeth. He slices open the buttocks of one of his victims using a kitchen knive, causing him to bleed to death. In a quick change of plan, he uses a staple gun and duct tape to attach each person's lips to the next person's buttocks. During the assembly process, the pregnant woman is presumed dead; Martin places her in the corner of the room under a sheet of tarp, along with the lessor, Dr. Sebring, and the other dead victim. His ""human centipede"" is ultimately 10 people long with Ashlynn in the front. After performing the crude procedure, Martin, now clad only in his underwear and a doctor’s coat, begins experimenting with his ""human centipede"". Martin force-feeds Ashlynn soup using a funnel and tubing after she refuses to eat from a bowl. Worried that her screams for help might be heard, Martin tears her tongue out with a pair of pliers. Martin then injects each victim with a syringe of laxative, forcing each individual in the chain to explosively evacuate their bowels into the mouth of the person behind them. He laughs happily while mocking and taunting them, but the smell eventually causes Martin to vomit. Martin then wraps his penis in barbed wire and rapes the woman at the rear of the centipede. As he finishes, the pregant woman wakes and runs outside screaming, apparently in labour. She leaps into a victim’s car outside and births her child into the car's foot well as Martin tries to get in. As the engine starts, she throws the vehicle into reverse and stomps on the accelerator, crushing the baby's skull under the pedal. Meanwhile, the neighbor rips his face from the person in front of him, separating the ""centipede"" into two halves. Martin returns and begins shooting all the victims. When he runs out of ammunition, he then uses a knife to slit the throats of the remaining victims. As Martin advances on Ashlynn he appears to give pause, drops the knife and kneels in front of her. She then punches him in the genitals, shoves the funnel into Martin's rectum, and drops his pet centipede into it. In agony, Martin stabs Ashlynn in the face and staggers out, screaming. Ashlynn is seen slightly moving afterwards. The scene cuts back to the toll booth, as Martin, looking the same as before the creation of his ""centipede"", is watching the credits of First Sequence on his laptop, while a baby can be heard crying in the background."

As the age of 12, he is caught stealing money from the family grocery shop. As punishment, he is not allowed to enjoy a treat with the rest of the family: mushrooms which turn out to be poisonous. His parents, siblings, uncle and grandparents all die. His mother's unscrupulous cousin takes charge of him, and uses his inheritance for his own benefit. Thus, it appears to the youngster that dishonesty pays. He runs away and works at various jobs, such as doorman and hotel bellhop. In Paris, he is unwillingly drawn into a plot to assassinate the visiting Czar Nicholas II of Russia by fellow restaurant worker Serge Abramich. However, an anonymous letter  leads to the arrest of Abramich and the other plotters. As an elevator operator in the Hotel de Paris in Monaco, the Cheat catches the eye of the much older Countess. They have a brief fling.  After a stint in the army, the Cheat decides to take up a profession that rewards honesty: croupier in a casino in Monaco. However, he is taken back into the French Army at the start of World War I. He is wounded almost immediately, but is rescued by Charbonnier, a fellow soldier who loses his right arm as a result. The army loses track of the Cheat, allowing him to spend the war reading books. Once more a civilian, he is picked up by a beautiful woman in a restaurant. After spending the night together, she confesses that she is a professional thief. She enlists him in robbing a jeweler of a ring through trickery. Though they are successful, he slips away afterward and returns to work as a croupier. An attractive regular at his roulette wheel believes he can control where the ball falls. Indeed, over the next few days, she wins consistently. They become partners; to ensure he will get his share of the winnings, he gets her to agree to a marriage of convenience. However, she loses all of the money she had won before; all of the other gamblers win so much, he is fired, ironically for being unable to cheat. The couple quickly obtain a divorce. He then becomes a professional card cheat. One day, while in disguise, he spots two women from his past, his former wife and the Jewel Thief together at a gambling table, evidently friends. He gallantly invites them to share half his bet, but only if he wins. He does, and they accept his dinner invitation. Both indicate they are willing to go to bed with him, still unaware of his true identity; he chooses his ex-wife because he had not slept with her before. Later, he cheats Charbonnier at baccarat before he recognizes his benefactor. Fortunately, they tie, but he is so filled with shame, he quits cheating. Charbonnier, having unwittingly cured the Cheat of one vice, infects him with another: the love of gambling. The Cheat loses all of the ill-gotten gains of years in a matter of months. Returning to the present, the Countess finally recognizes her former lover and tries to recruit him to help her rob the house across the street. The Cheat declines, explaining first that it was his former home and second that he has since embarked on the only honest job that utilizes his skills, that of security guard.

Larry, who is divorced and lives alone, cannot find a job and could lose his house. Larry's neighbor, Lamar , advises him to enroll in the local community college and get an education in order to get better opportunities in the future. As he looks over a course catalog, Larry meets the college dean, Dave Busik , who encourages him to take Economics and Speech. While pumping gas in his SUV, he sees a couple on scooters fueling up and how much cheaper it is to do so. Larry buys a scooter from Lamar's never-ending yard sale. On the first day of school, Larry meets Talia , a free spirit who also drives a scooter. They form a friendship right away. Mercedes Tainot  walks into the Speech class that she teaches and notices only nine students in attendance. Since the state requires at least ten, the class is cancelled, much to her delight. Suddenly, Larry appears, so Mercedes reluctantly begins teaching class. Larry and Talia share an Economics class taught by Dr. Ed Matsutani , who mixes sarcasm with seriousness in his teachings. He confiscates Larry's cell phone due to his texting habits with Talia. Mercedes is unhappily married. Her husband Dean  looks at pornography on his computer, removing web pages before Mercedes can catch him in the act. He fancies himself a writer of internet blogs and tells her that he works hard all day writing. When Mercedes informs him she knows he is really looking at porn, Dean's defense is that he's just ""a guy, who’s a guy, being a guy"". Frustrated while at home with him, she drinks heavily every night after school. Talia befriends Larry and invites him to join a club of scooter riders led by her boyfriend Dell Gordo , who is somewhat jealous of all the attention Talia gives Larry. Talia, with the help of her scooter gang friends, uses Feng Shui to reorganize Larry's house and give him a more stylish haircut and wardrobe. When a night with Dean goes horribly wrong, a drunken Mercedes demands to be let out of the car. Larry and gang notice Mercedes waiting alone at a bus stop, so Larry offers a ride home. Mercedes believes that Larry is involved with the much-younger Talia and reluctantly accepts a ride, but her attitude changes when they see Dean getting arrested. At her front door, Mercedes asks if Larry would care for a kiss, so they do. She wants to have sex as well, but Larry declines, not wanting to take advantage of her. After she closes the door, Larry celebrates. Dean comes home by cab to find all his stuff on the front lawn. Mercedes is unhappy and hungover and tells Larry not to brag to anyone about what happened the night before. Now that Larry cannot afford to live in his house any longer, he uses the knowledge he gained in his Economics class to legally turn over his house and keys to the bank, with a 30-day notice that he will be gone. Larry ends up hosting a yard sale and pizza party at Lamar's house, and upon paying for the pizzas, he's surprised to see that the delivery man is Jack , a snide executive who helped fire Larry. Larry is also now working at at a diner run by his friend, Frank . Mercedes runs into Talia, who is telling her English teacher , that she will be dropping out of college to start a thrift store. Mercedes assumes that Larry must know about her actions due to their supposed relationship, but Talia assures her that they are just friends. Mercedes appears to be happier now that she knows the truth. Larry, however, does not know about Talia dropping out, since he was surprised that he didn't see her in Economics class that day. He visits Talia, and appears to be slightly disappointed about her actions, but also wishes her luck in her future endeavors. Finals now come, and right before the Speech final, Larry and Mercedes meet outside class, with her telling Larry that she scheduled him last with his ""geography"" speech. After everyone has finshed their speech before him, Larry stands up in class and talks about his travels around the world while in the Navy, and makes references to the other students' speeches, who all appear to be inspired by his. Larry then looks at Mercedes as he mentions that he could never have told about his life with great passion and enthusiasm if he had not taken her Speech class. Larry is given a big round of applause by his classmates, as well as Mercedes, who is happier in her life without Dean and has developed a passion for teaching again. While working at the diner, Larry sees Mercedes with a friend, and approaches the table. She tells Larry that she gave him an ""A+"" in her class, which makes him very happy about going to school and finding more meaning in his life. When the next term begins, some of the students from Mercedes' Speech class register for her Shakespeare class, but are sad to see that Larry isn't registered for that class as well. Larry is seen taking Dr. Matsutani's second-term Economics class. Mercedes walks to her office and sees a note from Larry on the door, which is an invitation to have her over for a French toast dinner, with the address to his new apartment. She drives over to his apartment and he greets her, they kiss and both enter the apartment, closing the door behind them."

Talia, with the help of her scooter gang friends, uses Feng Shui to reorganize Larry's house and give him a more stylish haircut and wardrobe. When a night with Dean goes horribly wrong, a drunken Mercedes demands to be let out of the car. Larry and gang notice Mercedes waiting alone at a bus stop, so Larry offers a ride home. Mercedes believes that Larry is involved with the much-younger Talia and reluctantly accepts a ride, but her attitude changes when they see Dean getting arrested. At her front door, Mercedes asks if Larry would care for a kiss, so they do. She wants to have sex as well, but Larry declines, not wanting to take advantage of her. After she closes the door, Larry celebrates. Dean comes home by cab to find all his stuff on the front lawn. Mercedes is unhappy and hungover and tells Larry not to brag to anyone about what happened the night before. Now that Larry cannot afford to live in his house any longer, he uses the knowledge he gained in his Economics class to legally turn over his house and keys to the bank, with a 30-day notice that he will be gone. Larry ends up hosting a yard sale and pizza party at Lamar's house, and upon paying for the pizzas, he's surprised to see that the delivery man is Jack , a snide executive who helped fire Larry. Larry is also now working at at a diner run by his friend, Frank . Mercedes runs into Talia, who is telling her English teacher , that she will be dropping out of college to start a thrift store. Mercedes assumes that Larry must know about her actions due to their supposed relationship, but Talia assures her that they are just friends. Mercedes appears to be happier now that she knows the truth. Larry, however, does not know about Talia dropping out, since he was surprised that he didn't see her in Economics class that day. He visits Talia, and appears to be slightly disappointed about her actions, but also wishes her luck in her future endeavors. Finals now come, and right before the Speech final, Larry and Mercedes meet outside class, with her telling Larry that she scheduled him last with his ""geography"" speech. After everyone has finshed their speech before him, Larry stands up in class and talks about his travels around the world while in the Navy, and makes references to the other students' speeches, who all appear to be inspired by his. Larry then looks at Mercedes as he mentions that he could never have told about his life with great passion and enthusiasm if he had not taken her Speech class. Larry is given a big round of applause by his classmates, as well as Mercedes, who is happier in her life without Dean and has developed a passion for teaching again. While working at the diner, Larry sees Mercedes with a friend, and approaches the table. She tells Larry that she gave him an ""A+"" in her class, which makes him very happy about going to school and finding more meaning in his life. When the next term begins, some of the students from Mercedes' Speech class register for her Shakespeare class, but are sad to see that Larry isn't registered for that class as well. Larry is seen taking Dr. Matsutani's second-term Economics class. Mercedes walks to her office and sees a note from Larry on the door, which is an invitation to have her over for a French toast dinner, with the address to his new apartment. She drives over to his apartment and he greets her, they kiss and both enter the apartment, closing the door behind them."
27440737	/m/0c02hkq	The Last Furlong				{}	{}	{}	James Furlong is the last in a long line of Furlongs who were each blessed or cursed with a strange ability. His grandfather, Charlie went temporarily blind when he thought about sex. His father, Philip could turn off anything electrical when he was frightened. From the moment of his violent birth, involving the death of his mother, his life seems ill-fated, but it is unclear what kind of ability, if any, he possesses. Growing up in rural Ireland, his grandmother tells him about the strange quirks of his ancestors and the boy begins to experiment on himself, longing to discover some extraordinary, hidden power. But instead, his experiments lead to the death of his family's livestock, followed swiftly by the loss of Philip and his beloved grandmother, Charlotte. By the time he is ten years old, James is the sole survivor of the Furlong family. James is sent to St. Judes reformatory, but does not adjust easily to life there. Having been home-schooled on the farm, he is not equipped with the necessary social skills or abilities on the sports-field. He is bullied by the other boys, especially Kevin and Stephen. His only friend is Liam, the only one who shows him any kindness. His powers then kill the hurling Coach's vicious dog Tinkerbell. The principal, Mrs Moore suspects Kevin, because of his smug attitude. Kevin and Stephen attack James, for getting Kevin into trouble. A mysterious illness then sweeps through the reformatory, killing everyone except James and Liam, who flees and suffers only lung problems. In the chaos that ensues, he finally begins to comprehend the dark, destructive nature of his powers, and at the first opportunity he goes into hiding. Years later, he is discovered by a young woman, living out a lonely existence completely isolated from society. Mae  has run away from hospital where she is being treated for cancer and comes across James's cottage deep in the woods by chance. Initially, he is reluctant to have anything to do with her, fearful of harming her, but Mae has already resigned herself to her fate and is afraid of very little – certainly not of James with his gentle nature, and childlike innocence. Even when she learns his story, she is unafraid, and urges him to leave the cottage and his lonely life behind. Mae wants to savour all the time she has left in the world and hates to see someone so loving and compassionate isolated from it and denying himself everything that life has to offer. They soon fall in love, but Mae returns to the hospital soon after. James visits her, where they consummate their love. Soon after, James bumps into Liam, the sole survivor from the reformatory. In the final climactic scenes, Liam confronts James with the destruction of his past, and kills him with a scissors, before running away. James' strange powers had cured everyone in the hospital and stopped Mae's death. The film ends six years later with Mae telling their six year-old daughter, Diana  about James.

However, Trent is uninterested and instead wants Malcolm to sign a recording contract for him since he is underage. When Malcolm refuses, Trent's best friends encourage him to ambush Malcolm on the job in order to obtain the signature. Malcolm, in an attempt to capture Russian gang member Chirkoff , uses an informant named Canetti to deliver a flash drive to the gang, while Trent attempts to ambush Malcolm on the job. Canetti  reveals that the flash drive is empty and a duplicate is hidden with a friend at the Georgia Girls School for the Arts. During the exchange, Canetti's cover is blown and he is killed, which Trent witnesses. Malcolm eventually rescues Trent and they escape, but since Trent's car was left at the scene Malcolm knows the gang members will be able to track them down so Malcolm and Trent are forced to hide undercover. Malcolm reprises his role as Big Momma from the original film and also disguises Trent as her grandniece, Charmaine. Big Momma takes a job as a house mother at the Georgia Girls School for the Arts, while Charmaine is enrolled as a student. Surrounded by attractive young women, Trent nearly blows his cover, but manages to befriend a girl named Haley Robinson . The headmistress announces that a historic music box has been stolen from the library, and Malcolm deduces that this music box contains the flash drive. While scoping out the library, Big Momma encounters security guard Curtis Cool, who attempts to woo her while giving a tour. Seeing a picture of Curtis with Canetti, Malcolm realizes that he is the friend, and tries to find out more about the music box. Meanwhile, the gang members approach Trent's best friends, posing as record producers, and encourage them to notify them of Trent's whereabouts. Charmaine sets up a date between Haley and himself, though she doubts she will be interested in the seemingly egotistical ""Prodi-G,"" Trent's hip-hop alias. Trent reverts to his true self and the date goes well, but an encounter with Trent's best friends causes the gang members to tail them. Trent helps Haley perfect her musical performance for the upcoming ""Showcase"" event, turning it into a duet, and the two exchange a kiss at the end of the date, while Haley encourages Trent to pursue college. Before the gang members can capture Trent, he changes into his Charmaine disguise, throwing them off. Learning of an exchange between two students and Curtis Cool, Big Momma attempts to flirt with Curtis in order to apprehend him for stealing the music box, but the secret exchange ends up being the stolen gamecock from the Ignatius Boys School. During this encounter, Malcolm reveals his true identity to Curtis. After gaining the favor of several students by offering sage advice and comfort to them, Big Momma finally learns the music box was actually stolen by Haley. As she is about to perform her duet, Malcolm forces Trent to retain his Charmaine disguise, and he attempts to perform the duet with Haley as Charmaine, only to break disguise and ruin the performance. As Haley storms off, the gang members arrive and a chase ensues. Trent accidentally draws their attention as he attempts to pursue Haley and explain himself. Just as he recovers the flash drive, the gang members catch up and hold him at gunpoint. Big Momma interferes and provides an escape, but all three are caught again and Malcolm's disguise is revealed. Just as Chirkoff is about to kill him, Curtis arrives with a taser and saves the day. Trent and Haley reconcile, and Malcolm signs Trent's record contract, only to have him tear it up and reveal his new plan to attend college. As the film ends, Malcolm and Trent make an agreement to keep the whole ordeal a secret from Sherry."

It begins by examining how Iceland was highly deregulated in 2000 and the privatization of its banks. When Lehman Brothers went bankrupt and AIG collapsed, Iceland and the rest of the world went into a global recession.  The American financial industry was regulated from 1940 to 1980, followed by a long period of deregulation. At the end of the 1980s, a savings and loan crisis cost taxpayers about $124 billion. In the late 1990s, the financial sector had consolidated into a few giant firms. In 2001, the Internet Stock Bubble burst because investment banks promoted Internet companies that they knew would fail, resulting in $5 trillion in investor losses. In the 1990s, derivatives became popular in the industry and added instability. Efforts to regulate derivatives were thwarted by the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000, backed by several key officials. In the 2000s, the industry was dominated by five investment banks , two financial conglomerates , three securitized insurance companies  and the three rating agencies . Investment banks bundled mortgages with other loans and debts into collateralized debt obligations , which they sold to investors. Rating agencies gave many CDOs AAA ratings. Subprime loans led to predatory lending. Many home owners were given loans they could never repay.  During the housing boom, the ratio of money borrowed by an investment bank versus the bank's own assets reached unprecedented levels. The credit default swap , was akin to an insurance policy. Speculators could buy CDSs to bet against CDOs they did not own. Numerous CDOs were backed by subprime mortgages. Goldman-Sachs sold more than $3 billion worth of CDOs in the first half of 2006. Goldman also bet against the low-value CDOs, telling investors they were high-quality. The three biggest ratings agencies contributed to the problem. AAA-rated instruments rocketed from a mere handful in 2000 to over 4,000 in 2006.  The market for CDOs collapsed and investment banks were left with hundreds of billions of dollars in loans, CDOs and real estate they could not unload. The Great Recession began in November 2007, and in March 2008, Bear Stearns ran out of cash. In September, the federal government took over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which had been on the brink of collapse. Two days later, Lehman Brothers collapsed. These entities all had AA or AAA ratings within days of being bailed out. Merrill Lynch, on the edge of collapse, was acquired by Bank of America. Henry Paulson and Timothy Geithner decided that Lehman must go into bankruptcy, which resulted in a collapse of the commercial paper market. On September 17, the insolvent AIG was taken over by the government. The next day, Paulson and Fed chairman Ben Bernanke asked Congress for $700 billion to bail out the banks. The global financial system became paralyzed. On October 3, 2008, President Bush signed the Troubled Asset Relief Program, but global stock markets continued to fall. Layoffs and foreclosures continued with unemployment rising to 10% in the U.S. and the European Union. By December 2008, GM and Chrysler also faced bankruptcy. Foreclosures in the U.S. reached unprecedented levels.  Top executives of the insolvent companies walked away with their personal fortunes intact. The executives had hand-picked their boards of directors, which handed out billions in bonuses after the government bailout. The major banks grew in power and doubled anti-reform efforts. Academic economists had for decades advocated for deregulation and helped shape U.S. policy. They still opposed reform after the 2008 crisis. Some of the consulting firms involved were the Analysis Group, Charles River Associates, Compass Lexecon, and the Law and Economics Consulting Group . Many of these economists had conflicts of interest, collecting sums as consultants to companies and other groups involved in the financial crisis.{{cite news |urlEconomists Set Rules on Ethics |firstCasselman |workJanuary 9, 2012 |accessdate Part V: Where We Are Now  Tens of thousands of U.S. factory workers were laid off. The new Obama administration’s financial reforms have been weak, and there was no significant proposed regulation of the practices of ratings agencies, lobbyists, and executive compensation. Geithner became Treasury Secretary. Feldstein, Tyson and Summers were all top economic advisors to Obama. Bernanke was reappointed Fed Chair. European nations have imposed strict regulations on bank compensation, but the U.S. has resisted them.

Only eight of the residents, Eva and her boyfriend Sam, Josh and his brother Adrien, Josh's friend Bobby, Marilyn and her daughter Wendi, and Devlin manage to force their way into the building's bomb shelter before the superintendent, Mickey, seals the door. The group acclimate to the cramped surroundings while Mickey asserts his dominance of the shelter, to the chagrin of Josh, Bobby, and Devlin. After time passes, the shelter's door is broken open and the shelter is invaded by armed soldiers in biohazard suits; the men's speech is unintelligible, and their allegiance remains ambiguous. The men attack the group and seize Wendi, leaving the shelter with her. Devlin and Mickey manage to kill three of the men, and Mickey takes his rifle. Josh volunteers to use one of the dead soldier's suits to leave the shelter and search for Wendi. Outside of the shelter, Josh finds the area entirely sealed off by material tunnels connected to a laboratory. His outfit allows Josh to explore the lab, where he discovers several children, including Wendi, in stasis units, unconscious, their hair shaved off and their eyes bandaged. One of the soldiers checks the ID on Josh's and, realizing he is an impostor, tears out his breathing apparatus, exposing Josh to the air. Josh flees back to the shelter, killing two of the soldiers on the way. After Josh returns, the soldiers weld the door shut from the outside, trapping all within. Time passes; Josh begins to suffer the effects of his exposure and admits to Adrien that he only went outside to find rescue for Adrien and himself; Eva, in a fractured relationship with the meek Sam, grows closer to Adrien; Bobby is forced to hack up the bodies of the dead soldiers so their decaying remains can be thrown into the toilet septic tank; Devlin grows suspicious that Mickey is hoarding resources; and Marilyn, told her child is dead by Josh, enters a sexual relationship with Bobby. Marilyn attempts to convince Eva to sleep with Josh, warning her that the men will want sex. The group grow increasingly angry with Mickey as resources grow scarce, culminating when Devlin discovers Mickey's locked safe room and threatens him with a taser to open it. A scuffle ensues and Mickey shoots Devlin dead with the machine gun. The group do not believe Mickey's argument of self defense and an increasingly ill Josh, and an increasingly deranged Bobby, torture him to gain the code to the safe room; Eva throws the machine gun into the toilet to stop Josh using it. Seizing authority, Josh and Bobby are physically and emotionally abusive of Marilyn. Josh makes it clear that he wants Eva, and Sam is unable to stand up for her. Eva and Sam try to protect Marilyn from Josh and Bobby, but are unable to. While Eva is tasked with watching Mickey, Mickey reveals that there is a gun hidden in his safe room. Josh and Bobby force Eva to hack up Devlin's corpse when Sam cannot, leaving Eva distraught. Josh and Bobby, both losing their hair to radiation sickness, shave their heads. Mickey informs Eva that there is another way out of the shelter; through the septic tank to the sewer. Eva tries to retrieve the gun, but cannot get past the pair. She finds Marilyn's corpse, the two having beaten her to death. Eva notices her hair is falling out and realizes she is also sick; the shelter is not protecting them from the outside because of the broken door. Eva sends Sam to retrieve the gun while she cuts the power to distract Bobby and lures Josh away with the promise of sex. Josh grows suspicious and tries to rape Eva, but she fights him off with help from Adrien. Sam retrieves the gun, but as Bobby, Josh, Eva, and Adrien yell instructions at him, Sam shoots and kills Adrien. Josh brutally beats Sam. Bobby turns on Josh and is about to shoot him when Eva cuts his throat with a tin can lid. Eva frees Mickey who shoots Josh. Josh smashes an oil lamp, setting himself alight and causing a fire in the shelter. While Sam and Mickey attempt to put out the blaze, Eva chooses to escape. She recovers the biohazard suit, and locks herself in the bath room, leaving Mickey and Sam trapped outside, where both die in the fire's flashover. Breaking through the toilet into the septic tank below, Eva drops into the sewer and finds a ladder to the street. She emerges into the remains of the city and stares blankly at the total devastation.

He finds that all the staff and patrons have mysteriously vanished, leaving only their clothes and non-biological parts behind. He comes across a security guard who is holding a flashlight. As Paul had a headlamp on for his reading they deduce that people holding sources of light are protected against whatever dwells in the darkness. The guard's flashlight goes out, and he vanishes. As Paul investigates, his head lamp goes out as well. The following morning, news reporter Luke  wakes to find that there is no power in the building. After descending from his apartment, he notices that the doorman is missing and the paper is still the previous day's edition. People have completely vanished from downtown streets, now littered with abandoned cars and pieces of clothing. He heads to the news station to find his girlfriend, and it is later revealed that he discovered a recording which shows his girlfriend vanishing on air when the lights go out. The only thing he is able to recover is her ring. Three days pass, and Luke is alone trying to scavenge flashlight batteries or other sources of light. He briefly encounters a man who is taken by the darkness, before coming across a bar being powered by a backup generator. The bartender's young son, James , allows Luke to enter, followed soon after by another survivor, Rosemary . Rosemary proves distant due to the trauma of her baby disappearing during the blackout, while James is convinced that his mother is at a church down the street and will soon return. They hear a man outside, and see Paul, who has mysteriously ended up under the lit sign of a bus stop across the road. Luke leaves the safety of the bar to recover him and Paul reveals that he had been taken by the darkness, but the headlight that he had on had activated and he had found himself in the street three days later. Due to Paul's massive concussion, Rosemary says that they need to find a hospital, and Luke suggests going to Chicago, where he saw a recording of a man just before the power went out at the news station three days prior. Paul tells them about the mystery of the Roanoke Colony where over a hundred settlers disappeared overnight, and they seem to be experiencing the same sort of occurrence. He tells them that the word ""CROATOAN"" was found carved into a tree at the site of the empty colony when the next ship arrived. With the generator running down due to extended use, they realize it is only a matter of time before the power goes out on them. Luke comes up with a plan to take one of the nearly dead trucks on the street and feed power to it with the generator. He and Rosemary leave to obtain one, nearly getting caught in the darkness when the vehicle breaks down and they lose the light. Rosemary hears a baby crying in the dark, ignoring Luke's warnings that it is the darkness trying to trick her, she is lured under a solitary street light, and the lamp goes out taking her with it. At the bar, James goes to get Paul some water, and the drain on the power causes the lights to flash out. Wearing a glow-stick necklace, James is safe, but Paul vanishes from the pool table on which he is lying. Luke manages to push a truck back to the bar, and he escapes with James use the generator to get the truck started. As they pass the church up the block, James gets out to find his mother. Luke leaves, but after a conflict of conscience, and seeing the word ""CROATOAN"" carved into a sign hanging off a bridge, he returns, using the high beams from the truck to fend off the darkness. When Luke gets out of the truck to get James, the car battery dies and Luke too disappears. As James cowers under the glow of candles, which begin to go out, he pleads with the darkness ""I exist."" and all but one candle goes out. James wakes to daylight and sees the last candle had been burning all night. A little girl, Briana , appears and insists that James is sleeping on her bed, but urges him to stay with her. She shows him her flashlight, which is solar powered, allowing it to stay on all night without having to search for new batteries. As they leave the church, they encounter a police horse eating spilled apples on the ground and decide to take it to Chicago. As the sun sets on the children leaving the city, the camera pans to the bar, casting the shadows of Luke, Paul and Rosemary watching the two leave as the darkness falls. As it gets dark, Briana's light comes on, ensuring their protection against the darkness as they begin their journey."

Danny unwittingly kills him in front of his young child, then is injured during the getaway. Affected by this outcome, Danny retires and returns to his native Australia. One year later, Danny is summoned to Oman where Hunter is being held captive. He meets with the Agent , who arranges missions for killers, and learns that Hunter accepted a $6 million job but failed to accomplish it. If Danny doesn't complete Hunter's mission, Hunter will be executed. Danny is introduced to Sheikh Amr, a deposed king of a small region of Oman who wants Danny to kill three former SAS agents—Steven Harris , Steven Cregg, and Simon McCann—for killing his three eldest sons during the Dhofar Rebellion. Danny must videotape their confessions and make their deaths look like accidents, and he must do it before the terminally ill Sheikh dies. This will allow the Sheikh's fourth son, Bakhait , to regain control of the desert region his father had ruled. If Danny fails, Hunter will be killed. Danny reunites with Davies and Meier. They agree to help him in exchange for a share of the money. As Danny and Meier sneak into the house of their first target, Steven Harris, in Oman, Davies questions local bar patrons about former SAS members. This is reported to the Feathermen, a secret society of former operatives protecting their own. Their head enforcer, Spike Logan , is sent to investigate. After Harris has confessed on videotape, Danny and Meier take him to the bathroom. Their plan is to break his neck using a hammer with tiles similar to those of the bathroom floor to make it appear that Harris slipped and broke his neck. Danny is distracted by the arrival of Harris's girlfriend and when he returns to the bathroom he finds that Meier was forced to kill Harris hastily in a struggle. Back in London, Davies discovers the second target, Steven Cregg, preparing for a long nighttime march in wintry weather at a local SAS base. Davies pretends to be a civilian having car problems outside the base's fence, allowing Danny to infiltrate the base. There he drugs Cregg's coffee to induce shock and cause Cregg to die of hypothermia during the march. Danny, in uniform, follows Cregg on the march, and a delirious Cregg confesses on videotape to Danny before he dies. Going to their last target, Simon McCann, currently a mercenary, they rig a truck to respond to remote control with the help of a new and inexperienced team member, Jake . As McCann is on his way to a fake job interview, Meier and Jake take control of the truck from another car and cause it to move in front of McCann's car, killing him. However, Logan and his men were watching over McCann. A gun fight in the docks ensues, and Meier is accidentally killed by Jake due to his lack of experience. Danny and Davies decide that the case is over, and they part ways. Davies is soon hit by a truck and killed while being chased by Logan's men. Danny returns to Oman and gives the Sheikh the last taped confession, which he has faked. Hunter is released and returns to his family, while Danny heads back to Australia and reunites with Anne , a childhood acquaintance. Soon, he is informed by the Agent that there is one last man who participated in the Sheikh's sons' murders and that this man, Ranulph Fiennes, is about to release a book about his experiences as a member of the SAS. Danny tells Anne to go to France with Hunter to protect her while he carries out the last job. The Sheikh’s son confirms that Harris was an innocent man. Logan, meanwhile, traces Danny through the Agent and sends a team to protect the author, but Jake distracts them, allowing Danny to infiltrate the building and shoot the author. He chooses to only wound the author, however, but takes pictures that appear to show him dead. Logan chases and captures Danny, taking him to an abandoned warehouse, but he is interrupted when an agent from the British government arrives and reveals that the British government is behind the events because of the Sheikh's valuable oil reserves. A three-way battle ensues, with Danny escaping and Logan shooting the government agent. Danny and Hunter head to Oman to give the Sheikh the pictures. However, Logan arrives first and confronts the Sheikh, telling him that the pictures are fake and then stabbing him to death. The Sheikh's son does not care and gives the money, which was intended for Danny and Hunter, to Logan. Hunter spots Logan leaving, and they chase after him, along with the Sheikh's men. After stopping the Sheikh's men, Danny and Hunter confront Logan on a desert road. Danny says that Logan can keep the money . They give Logan the remainder, telling him that he'll need it to start a new life away from the government after killing the government agent and acting against the wishes of the Feathermen and the British government. Danny says that it's over for him and that Logan must make up his own mind. They leave him there, saying they'll send a cab for him from the airport. Danny meets with Anne in France to start a new life.

Getaway driver Carl ""Luke"" Lucas  is arrested after a robbery for his crime boss Markus Kane  goes wrong. As his accomplices are robbing the bank, two police officers casually enter the building. Luke tells his accomplices to abort, but they refuse; Luke intervenes, resulting in the death of one of the three accomplices. Luke shoots and kills one of the officers and dumps off his accomplices in order to fulfill Markus's wishes. In doing so, Luke is eventually captured by the police following a high-speed chase and sentenced to serve time on Terminal Island. Markus, worried that Luke will trade info on his crimes for immunity, discovers his location and orders his men to take Luke out. Terminal Island is a prison under the control of The Weyland Corporation, which hosts Death Match, a televised pay-per-view competition where two dangerous convicts are chosen and then forced to fight to the death or submission. The prisoners are given access to weapons or defense items to use during the fight by stepping on a marked plate in the arena. Luke meets the men who eventually become his pit crew in the Death Race: Lists , who annoys him by over-analyzing everything, Goldberg , and Rocco . The host of Death Match is September Jones , a former Miss Universe who lost her crown due to allegations of having a sexual relationship with all of its judges. She now works for The Weyland Corporation to create profit from the pay per view subscribers of Death Match. When a convict, Big Bill, tries to stab Luke for a bounty placed by Markus Kane to ensure he doesn't testify, Lists takes it upon himself to warn him. Lists pushes Luke against a wall just as the other convict approaches, enabling Luke to defend himself successfully. Luke is later approached in the showers by September, who witnessed him in the earlier scuffle, and proposes that he fight in Death Match. When he refuses, she makes sexual advances towards him, which he pretends to go for before refusing. In retaliation, September chooses Lists to fight in a Death Match with Big Bill. Luke confronts her while Lists is running for his life during the event, pleading to let him fight in place of Lists. She refuses to help and he jumps over a barbed fence to fight for Lists. He is joined by Katrina Banks , a woman convict who is serving as a ring girl with other female convicts. She hits Big Bill with a round number sign made of metal. A riot breaks out during the fight between Luke and the convict because of racial tension, sparked because Luke is white and the other convict is black. The convicts break down the fence to get in, and some of the rapists attack and attempt to rape female convicts. Katrina defends herself and helps other women, who are then evacuated. When the riot control guards come, Luke surrenders. Afterward, Luke is well received when he sees Katrina and inquires about her well-being after the fight. Markus sees Luke during the showing of Death Match and is convinced that it is only a matter of time before Luke cracks and testifies. He increases pressure on his men and puts a bounty of $1 million on Luke's head. Meanwhile, September comes up with a plan to boost their profits by converting the failing Death Match into a ""Death Race"", where the contestants will have to race over days to win each match. The person who manages to win five such matches will be released from prison. Luke joins the race, during which other prisoners try to kill him to earn Markus's bounty. During the race, he notices that another racer, 14K, is the only one not trying to kill him since they don't do business with other crime rings. Luke ends up saving 14K, telling Katrina that 14K now owes him one. However, during the race they realize that their car has been rigged to not work any of its defenses or weapons. Katrina even admits that Markus offered her a reward if she killed Luke. When Big Bill attacks Luke, Luke gets Katrina to jettison out of the car safely just before Big Bill fires a missile at Luke. Luke's car crashes and catches fire, leading everyone to believe that he is dead. Big Bill is in turn killed by his navigator. Luke is revealed to have survived, albeit with extensive scarring to his face and body. September then convinces him to rejoin a new race with the new identity. Meanwhile, 14K sends word to the Triad to repay his debt to Luke, ""a life for a life,"" and manages to kill Markus. Also, Lists kills Rocco in the shower house after discovering he rigged Luke's car. Luke, with a new identity, then kills September by running her over with his car during a race, much to the pleasure of many of the people she blackmailed, used or seduced to get what she wants. The movie ends with Frankenstein starting his race with both Lists and Katrina inferring that Luke is the new Frankenstein."

He leaves his fiancee  at a hotel while he goes to the next town to get his car fixed. When he returns the next morning, she is missing. He requests to speak with the night clerk who tells him she checked out 30 minutes after he left the night before. He has a slight altercation with the night clerk at which point the police are summoned. The police do not suspect foul play and ask Ted to leave the hotel. When he leaves, a private detective  follows him and offers his services to locate Ted's fiancee. On the drive back to the city and Ted's apartment, Ted tells Mr. Taynor the story of how they met and Mr. Traynor implies Ted has been conned. When they arrive at Ted's apartment all of Alice's belongings are still there. Ted gives Mr. Traynor a picture of Alice and finds her marriage certificate. Mr. Taynor knocks out Ted, steals the marriage certificate and leaves. We see that Mr. Traynor was working for Mr. Barkley to find Alice and retrieve the marriage certificate. Ted tracks down Alice by her husband's name from the marriage certificate. The husband  is there  and tells Ted that Alice has spells where she does not remember who she is and claims she is being held against her will and then escapes. Mr Barkley offers to allow Ted to speak with her so he can hear from her own mouth that she is married. After Ted leaves, it is clear Alice is being held against her will after all. The people holding her captive were her in laws. They were holding her captive because she was the heir to the Barkley estate, having inherited it from her husband. The in laws did not want to lose the estate to Alice. Ted returns to his apartment still unsettled about Alice's circumstances, but still not being able to prove she is being held against her will. In the glove box of his car he finds her passport. He discovers she has only been in the country, from France, for a few weeks, not the several years Alice's husband asserted. Since Alice was forced into admitting she is married to Mr. Barkley, Ted must prove on his own that Mr. Barkley is lying. Ted goes back to the Barkley house and is attacked by a dog. The grounds keeper tells Ted the family has left for good and has put Alice in a rest home because her ""bad spells"" have been getting worse. Ted runs off after finding out the name of the doctor treating her. We see Mr. Traynor still investigating the case and he has found a picture of Alice and her husband, but the man in the picture is not the Mr. Barkley Mr. Traynor and Ted have met. Ted goes to the hospital Alice is being held at and finds her just as the in laws arrive to finish the financials with the doctor. An altercation ensues between Mr. Barkley and Ted when Mr. Traynor arrives with police, exposing the true story. Ted and Alice are seen in the final scene walking into a wedding chapel together."

Shortly afterward, their four-year-old daughter Heidi begins spending time with an imaginary friend, a kindly old man named Mr. Gordy. Several months later, Heidi is frightened by the appearance of a man at the front door. The man, whose hand is wrapped in bandages and shirt covered in blood, introduces himself as ""Khan"", but upon investigation, Heidi's mother is unable to find Khan, and dismisses him as a figment of Heidi's imagination. However, shortly after this event, Heidi begins to see images of ""the Dark Figure"", a man whose face is obscured by a hood. The family believe that there's more to the Dark Figure than just a child's active imagination, after Heidi awakens one night with claw marks on her face; shortly after this incident, her father Andy suffers the same scratches on his side. The entire family soon grows to fear the Dark Figure, although for a long time, Heidi is the only family member who ever actually sees him. The family contacts William G. Roll, a parapsychologist. Dr. Roll claims that his instruments indicate an unusually high concentration of positive ions in the house, and his research reveals that the house lies near a fault line; an earthquake has created a magnetic field in the area. He theorizes that the haunting is a result of hallucinations caused by the ions creating minor interference with the family's brain function. Roll's claims purport to be more of a scientific explanation than is usually offered in episodes of the series. However, further research reveals that a kindly old man named Gordy used to serve as caretaker for the property, and that a man named Lon  once lost his hand in an accident nearby; photos of both men supposedly match Heidi's descriptions, even though they both had died decades before Heidi was even born. In light of these developments, Dr. Roll amends his theory, and claims that the family, especially Heidi, is genetically predisposed toward psychic abilities that allow her to detect ""place memories"", energy left behind by past events and people that have been ""recorded"" into the environment. However, Dr. Roll maintains that these are natural conditions, and are neither dangerous nor paranormal in nature. As years go by, the hauntings, according to the family, become more disturbing. The kindly Mr. Gordy appears less and less as Heidi grows older, until he eventually disappears altogether. The terrifying Dark Figure, however, appears more frequently, and Heidi is no longer the only one who sees him. The ghost of a little girl also appears to several family members. In addition, voices and other sounds disturb visitors to the house and the entire family . Dissatisfied with Dr. Roll's explanation, the Wyricks consult two psychics, who independently claim to detect several spirits in the home, some benevolent and some evil. The psychics disagree, however, about the nature of the evil spirits; the first psychic, Amy Allan, does not believe in demons, while the second psychic, who attends Mrs. Wyrick's church, agrees with Mrs. Wyrick's assumption that the evil spirits are demonic.

Jinnai wakes up at an abandoned temple, hanging upside down along with corpses of other ninjas. He discovers an organism lurking within his throat, but before he can react, it takes over his body. The boy leads Yamata and Rin to the temple, only to be surrounded by Jinnai and the dead ninjas, who are being manipulated by small organisms secreted from the alien's nostrils. The possessed Jinnai and the dead ninjas utter English expletives before Yamata takes one down to shut them up. After discovering a pair of eyes peeking from a dead ninja's mouth, Yamata tells Rin to target the dead ninjas' throats. Rin dispatches the ninjas by ejecting the organisms from their throats while Yamata shoves his hand through Jinnai's mouth to extract the symbiote controlling him. After a long struggle, Yamata frees Jinnai from the alien's control. Yamata then squares off against the last alien in a cave. Overpowered by Yamata's skills, the alien sprouts wings to fly out of the scene, but Yamata grabs its leg before taking off. The alien attempts to shake Yamata off its back, but Yamata places a bomb on it and jumps off before it explodes. Yamata lands safely and reunites with his comrades before they return home, unaware that the boy has one of the organisms in his bag.

The fact that they come from three completely different backgrounds only serves to bring them closer together and complement each other in every aspect of life. Jahan is a wealthy young man who loves to party and live life to the fullest. His biggest weakness in life is the fact that he has a soft spot for the ladies and always likes to have a new girl by his side. However, although Jahan may seem all bright and bubbly on the surface, he does have a cross to bear. Jahan’s parents’ split up when he was young, and he now lives with his father and step mother. His relationship with them is far from perfect, as his father is hardly ever at home, while he can’t stand his step mother. This leaves Jahan feeling unwanted and looking to his friends for support, his closest ally being Babar. Babar is a hardworking guy who has his feet firmly on the ground. After having been scarred for life during his childhood, because his mother left his father due to financial issues, Babar has deep psychological problems. For him, his friends are his only family and people he can rely on through thick and thin. Rida meanwhile is a self–made young girl who has worked her way through college with a lot of dignity and self-respect. For Rida, life is all about living from the heart, and taking decisions on impulse rather than thinking them through logically. A trait her friends sometimes find it very hard to deal with. ‘Yariyan’ is the story of how Jahan, Rida and Babar’s friendship is tested as they go through life. Whether it’s Rida’s decision to marry an HIV patient; Jahan’s decision to let Babar look after his newly inherited family business; or the love of Babar’s life, who soon catches Jahan’s eye and becomes the reason he reforms himself; life’s twists and turns make all three friends question their friendship more than once.

Schaeffer, the old sheepdog, goes down to the lake, where he and his friends The Raccoons  go to play a round of hockey. Cedrc Sneer is also at the rink, too, where he meets Sophia Tutu, a female aardvark figure skater who takes an interest in Cedric. Meanwhile, Cyril Sneer has plans for Evergreen Lake - he plans on building his 'Cyril Dome' over the entire lake. But as Cyril and his construction crew are ready to build, the Raccoons and their friends stop them in their tracks and try to defend their lake. Bert then steps in and proposes that the two warring sides should play a hockey game to determine who gets the lake. Before Bert's friends try to stop him, Bert and Cyril seal the deal. While Cyril trains his Bears for the game, the Raccoons ask Cedric to play on their side. Cedric agrees, as long as he can get away from his father, who disapproves of Cedric's friendship with the Raccoons. As they train, Cedric is shown to be a great hockey player and the team feel like they have a good chance against Cyril's team, but Cyril goes to spy on the Raccoons and he is immediately not happy with his son siding with the Raccoons. He grounds Cedric for a month and he also forbids Cedric from seeing Sophia  ever again. Despite the setback, the Raccoons and Schaeffer continue to practice. On the night before the game, the friends decide to sneak into Cyril Sneer's mansion to ask Cedric if he will play alongside them. However, Cedric is more concerned for their safety and warns them of what could happen if Cyril finds them. A moment later, they are almost caught by Cyril, who claims he can hear other voices and angrily threatens his son not to go anywhere near the Raccoons again. Because of this, Cedric becomes too scared and the friends leave without his backing. On the night of the game, Cyril's Bears are pummelling the Raccoons team by 3-0. After Bert injures his hand, Sophia finally goes up to Cedric, who has been dragged along to watch the game, and convinces him to help out. Masquerading as a ""mystery player"", Cedric manages to tie the game 3-3. Cyril finds out who the mystery player is, literally kicking his own son off the ice and threatening to lock him in the dungeon as a punishment.

Bert manages to win the game for the team in the last few seconds, thus saving Evergreen Lake from Cyril's greed. The next day, Julie, Tommy and their father arrive at the lake and find skate marks from the game.

He initially keeps this a secret, and only tells her after he's completed basic training and is about to begin Airborne parachute training at Fort Benning, Georgia. Brenda drives down to Georgia in an attempt to stop him, but when she arrives Jimmy has already entered Fort Benning.

They flee from the ship, but are apprehended by dock workers and the New York police. The McRuby's Ukrainian crew watches the detention with some amusement, but the ship's captain and his first mate, Ion Plesin, are displeased, aware that the illegal immigrants will cost the shipping company hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines. In response, company representative Andreas Vlachos arrives to oversee future operations and warn that the crew will be liable for any more such fines. Later, the McRuby is docked in Ghana, where dock worker Kingsley Ofosu plans to some day stow away aboard a cargo ship to pursue a better life for himself and his pregnant wife in the United States. Upon winning a lottery, he decides that the time is right, as he can use the money to get on his feet upon his arrival. Ofosu, his brother and six other men slip aboard the McRuby and hide in its cargo holds. With the ship behind schedule, Plesin has only one hour to conduct a stowaway search prior to departure. The hasty endeavor fails to turn up Ofosu's group and the ship sails, bound for France, prior to sailing on to New York. Ofosu's group encounters another stowaway, who had boarded the ship in Cameroon. The men jovially discuss the vocations they intend to pursue in the United States. Later, their water container breaks, forcing them to leave the cargo area to forage for food and water. They leave evidence of the presence, which is then discovered by the crew. To prevent Vlachos from learning that the stowaway search had been incomplete, the captain has Plesin assemble a small team to conduct a secret perquisition. The stowaways are found and Plesin discusses the predicament with the captain. Given the illegal immigrant fines, they cannot bring the stowaways into port. However, they also cannot alter course to drop the men off somewhere, as Vlachos would then find out about them. The Africans are taken to be hidden within the ship's anchor hold. When they object, they find Plesin unsympathetic to their desire to escape poverty. He points out that if the stowaways' presence becomes known, he and his men will be fired, and any other jobs they can find in Ukraine will pay even less than the meager wages earned by Ofosu on the docks in Ghana. The stowaways are forced into the hold and initially left without food or water. Yuri, one of Plesin's men, takes pity and secretly delivers them a little water, but he is powerless to do more. As the stowaways suffer, Ofosu laments that he has led the group to their deaths. The captain finally acquiesces to Plesin's plan to kill the stowaways. The men are taken from the hold in small groups. As each group is brought into another area, they are ambushed and their bodies thrown overboard. Yuri tries to stop the massacre, but the others overpower and subdue him. Ofosu and his brother are the last two brought out, but they surmise what is about to occur and make a run for it, heading in different directions. As they do, Ofosu's brother is shot and, with his injury, is soon caught and thrown overboard as Ofosu watches. Ofosu flees back below decks to hide and is able to elude further searches for him. While in the cargo hold, Ofosu stashes a picture of himself and his wife inside one of the cocoa sacks. Plesin's men are concerned about their inability to locate their final stowaway, but they reason that all Western countries despise black immigrants and thus no one will be motivated to take action against them. They also expect to be able to secure him upon reaching port when he tries to exit the ship. However, once the ship docks, Ofosu is able to escape to shore and make it to the police before Plesin's men can catch him. The next day, French authorities board the McRuby to investigate Ofosu's story. Plesin first denies that there had been any stowaway, but the ship's cocoa sacks are searched, yielding Ofosu's picture. Plesin's final play is to acknowledge the killings but to suggest that he and his men had done France a favor by preventing undesirable blacks from entering the country illegally. The police are unimpressed by this rationale and immediately arrest Plesin and his men, along with the captain. The film ends with Ofosu on the phone with his wife, hearing the cries of his newborn son, whom he pledges to name after his brother. An epilogue notes that the captain and first mate were convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. Three other crew members were also convicted and received 20-year sentences, while one crew member was acquitted. Kingsley Ofosu was living in France and hoping to have his wife and child join him.

The film takes place during the summertime. Benjie  is a likeable but troubled teen. He lives with his mother, named Sweets , and grandmother, named Mrs. Bell . Benjie has several friends and playmates within the neighborhood and his grades at school are above average. He is surprisingly normal and healthy for a teenager. However, in the midst, there is something going on inside Benjie that nobody around him knows or understands. Benjie has deep pain which stems from constantly dealing with the fact that his father left the family and the fallout since his departure. On top of it all, Benjie cannot manage to get along with his mother's new boyfriend, Butler . Benjie deals with the emotional weight by trusting his school friends and building relationships stronger than with his own family. He soon discovers that he is happier with his pseudo-family than what he understands to be his miserable real family. Benjie conforms to the group and his behavior and outlook changes rapidly as he is engulfed by the overwhelming peer pressure. Among Benjie’s buddies are Carwell . Carwell is the one who introduces Benjie to heroin; one day he takes him to the drug dealer’s home, named Tiger . Benjie is hardly a street rat; he has a loving family who is always worrying about his well being. Butler , the new man around the house is equally concerned about Benjie, but often at odds with him only to be sided against by the boy’s mother. Benjie’s life at school is a refuge as he has two caring teachers who look after him. The first, Nigeria  is a hip and bold extrovert, asking his students to learn and recite important facts of black history, which Benjie proves he can absorb information with ease. Benjie’s other influence is Mr. Cohen , concerned that Nigeria’s over-emphasis on African history and desire to rid the school of non-white staff are wrong, a sort of anti-thesis. The conflict between these two polar differences in belief, a tug-of-war over education, history, and white privilege, plays a larger end-game role in the story as we see it unfold before Benji’s eyes. The continued drug use along with the corrupted group mentality soon got Benjie hooked on heroin ultimately crumbling to the merciless drug.

They meet at an undisclosed location outside London and discuss Dave's relationship with his brother.

He was sent to Earth as a child with eight others to escape the invading Mogadorians, who destroyed Lorien. Here, John is protected by a Guardian, Henri , and has developed ""legacies"", including enhanced strength, speed and agility, telekinesis and the power to transmit plasma light through his hands. The Mogadorians, led by the Commander  learn about the nine children and come to Earth to find them. The Loriens can only be killed in sequence; Number One through Number Nine, though, and three of them are already dead, with John being Number Four. Knowing this, he and Henri move from a beachside bungalow in Florida to an old farm in Paradise, Ohio, where John befriends conspiracy theorist Sam Goode  and a dog which he names Bernie Kosar. He also falls for an amateur photographer, Sarah Hart . Her ex-boyfriend, football player Mark James  is a bully who torments both John and Sam. During the Halloween festival, Mark and his friends chase Sarah and John into the woods, where they try to beat John up. However, he uses his legacies to fend them off and rescue Sarah. Sam witnesses this and how he'd used his legacies. John reveals his true origins to Sam. The next day, Mark's father, the local sheriff, interrogates Henri on John's whereabouts when his son and his friends were attacked. Henri tells John that too many people are suspicious of them so they have to leave. John refuses because of Sarah. Meanwhile the Mogadorians continue searching for John, while being trailed by another Lorien, Number Six  who is also trying to locate Number Four. Number Six's guardian was killed, and she realizes that the remaining six of the Lorien Guard will have to team up and fight against the Mogadorians. She knows Number Three is dead and that Number Four is being hunted. The Mogadorians eventually locate John and manipulate two conspiracy theorists into capturing Henri. When John and Sam go to rescue him, they are attacked but manage to fend the Mogadorians off. However, Henri dies after John and Sam escape with some Lorien artifacts, including a blue rock that acts as a tracking device for other Loriens. Sam's father, a conspiracy theorist who disappeared while hunting aliens in Mexico, had another of the rocks. While Sam searches for it, John tries to say goodbye to Sarah at a party, only to discover that the Mogadorians have framed him and Henri for the murders of the conspiracy theorists. Mark sees John and calls his father, who corners John and Sarah. John saves Sarah from a fall, revealing his powers in the process, and they escape to their high school. Meanwhile, The Commander arrives in Paradise, in a convoy of trucks. He is confronted by Mark and his father, and after injuring the sheriff, he forces Mark to show him where John is hiding. Mark takes him to the school, which he knows is Sarah's hideout. There, John, Sarah and Sam are attacked by the Mogadorians, who brought two giant monsters to hunt the trio. They are saved by Number Six and Bernie, who is actually a shapeshifting Chimera sent by John's biological parents to protect him. John and Number Six, who can teleport and can block energy attacks, continue to fight the Mogadorians. They eventually defeat them all, including the Commander. The following day, John and Number Six unite their blue rocks and discover the location of the other four surviving Lorians. John decides to let Sam come with them in hopes of finding Sam's father. They set off to find the others so they can all protect Earth from the Mogadorians, leaving Sarah and a repentant Mark, who lies to his father about John's whereabouts and returns a box left to John by his Dad that was in police evidence.

On her way to class, she sees an innocent kid, Miles  getting bullied by Marco , the ""evil"" stepbrother of William ""Will"" Wagner , the star quarterback and practically the most popular guy at Avalon. Fortunately, Will comes to the rescue, demanding Marco to leave Miles alone or else. European History teacher Mr. Moore breaks the class up into pairs and has them draw research paper topics out of an Arthurian helmet. Miles is paired with Allie, who draws the Order of the Bear. After school, Allie tries out for the school track team and impresses the coaches. Later that evening, Miles comes to Allie's house to study. Following Mr. Moore's advice, the two ask Allie's parents—professors of medieval literature at the local university—about the Order of Bear. Allie's mother tells them that the Order of the Bear is a group of people who believe that King Arthur will one day be reincarnated. Skeptically, Allie asks when this is supposed to take place; her mother replies that Arthur will return when he is needed to lead the world out of darkness. While he shares Allie's skepticism, her father goes on to explain that the forces of evil—led by Arthur's evil step brother Mordred—will also be returning to spoil the revival of Camelot and ensure that darkness triumphs. The next day, after class with Mr. Moore, he asks her if she found any information on the Order of the Bear. Allie tells him that she finds it doubtful that there will be a reincarnation of King Arthur. However, like Allie's mom, Mr. Moore too believes that King Arthur will be reincarnated. Allie suggests that she could bring the prophecy tomorrow for him, though he declines. On their way to the cafeteria, Allie spots Lance and Jen flirting with each other. But they immediately back away from each other when they notice that Allie caught them flirting with each other. After school, Allie goes running around the school when her cap falls off. Coincidentally, it ends up in Will's hands. Will admits that he feels too much pressure from everyone counting on him to win the game and, but Allie comforts him and invites Will to her house for dinner. The next day, Will has a party to celebrate them winning the game where she sees Jen and Lance together holding hands in a room all by themselves. Allie takes a second look but Jen and Lance see her and Allie runs away, Jen goes after Allie wanting to explain what was going on. Somehow, Jen knows about their reincarnation when she talks to Ally about her betrayal with her first love back in time and her love affair with Lance. Despite understanding Jen missing home, her pain, and torn heart, Ally can not accept the fact that she's hurting Will. She tries to make Allie promise not to tell Will but Allie runs away before she promises Jen anything. Jen feels hurt and confused and doesn't know what to do. The next day, Allie brings the book for Mr. Moore to read. Throughout the day, she tries to avoid talking Will due to the pleading looks of Jen and Lance they keep giving her. Marco also warns Allie about telling Will about Jen and Lance. However, the Will meets up with her while running and become closer. At the game, Lance is temporarily distracted by Jen's cheerleading, allowing Will to get hit by the opposing team. This cost them the game, and possibly the state championship. Afterwards, Allie sits with him by the field, intending to tell him of Jen's betrayal, but Marco interrupts her. That night, Miles comes to her house and hesitantly reveals that he can see in to the future. He came to tell her that there is a hidden page in the book on the Order of the Bear. They learn that the coming of Arthur is on a night of an eclipse and a meteor shower, the day of the big game. The book also warns of the coming of Mordred, who intends to destroy his half-brother Arthur. After getting more insight from her parents, they begin to suspect Marco may be Mordred. Allie also begins to think that Miles may be Merlin, but he begs to differ. The next day, they have a big exam. Marco plants a cheat sheet on the bottom of Will's shoe. Mr. Moore almost gives him detention but decides to give him benefit of the doubt. However his team resents him for the incident. They no longer respect his authority as team captain. Later that day, Allie reveals to Mr. Moore that she believes that Will is King Arthur and asks for his help in protecting him. In the chemistry lab, Miles and Allie's experiment goes wrong due to tampering, and Marco warns them about meddling. On the night of the game, Will sees Jen kiss Lance. Will gets in his car and drives away. Allie runs after him to the same spot where the first talked. Someone pushes her down. She tells Will that fate is involved in what happened. That he is King Arthur. He gets mistaken and thinks that its a metaphor. After her speech he gets courage to win the game despite what happened. Will speeds off without giving Allie a chance to explain. At the game, just when he's about to play, its lights out because the eclipse and meteor shower have begun. Lights come back up and game continues, but his line men don't defend him properly. At halftime, Will speaks with Lance, and the two mend their friendship. Will also gives a pep talk to his team and forgives Jen, but he forgets his helmet in the locker room. Before he goes back to get it, he tells Allie to meet him after the game, but he doesn't come back to play. Allie and Miles go looking for him in the locker room but can't find him there. Miles sees Will in a vision in the theater room. They find Marco on the ground and Will injured, but Will says it wasn't Marco that hurt him. Mr Moore comes out of the audience seating and tells them he himself is actually Mordred. As Mr. Moore tries to kill them, Marco pushes Mr. Moore off the stage. Allie does not understand how Mr. Moore is Mordred. While Marco explains, Mr. Moore regains his power through his cane/staff and fully transforms into Mordred. With his power through his cane attacks the four. To defend Will, Allie picks a toy sword by a box and holding it she turns that into a real sword by the legend that ""any sword, in King Arthur's hands becomes Excalibur. They find out that Allie is really the reincarnation of King Arthur. After being transported back into their original time period, Allie  goes head to head with Mr. Moore . He taunts her saying that a girl can't be Arthur. He thought Allie was the Lady of the Lake. The two forces clash, Allie and her knights  against Mordred and his men. Miles  reclaims his staff. Enraged, Mordred pulls out his own sword and begins to messily. Allie knocks his sword away, and wins the battle. The group transports back to the stage where a police man comes to kick them out. Mr Moore tries to frame Allie, but she tosses the sword to Miles where it turns back into a toy sword. Despite Mr. Moore's attempts, the police man doesn't believe that Allie is King Arthur. Will rushes off to the football field. Mr. Moore is last seen being taken away by the police, and Miles accepts that he's Merlin. Before they go back to the game, Marco bows to Allie, ""Her Highness."" Back at the game, twelve seconds are left when Will returns. Allie and Miles return to the stands where her parents -having missed all the action- wonder if Arthur's return was just a story. After Will's flawless touchdown, Avalon High wins the football game 36 to 35. The team celebrates putting Will on their shoulders, but Will runs to Allie. The two share a kiss. Lance and Jen get together, and Miles gets his girl as well. In the end the fierce group officially return to their time period where Allie, Will, Jen, Marco, Lance and Miles meet again at the Round Table as the people they were originally to be."

Mexican and United States troops battle to contain the creatures, while a wall stretching along the American border ostensibly keeps the United States protected. The film begins with night vision footage of a U.S. Army patrol driving through a town in the middle of the night. An explosion flips one of the vehicles, and flashes of gunfire show U.S. soldiers firing at an enormous tentacled creature. The alien's features are similar to that of an octopus, yet it strides upon several hard, insect-like legs. In the background, a radio transmission from one of the soldiers obtains approval for a dangerously close air strike. Meanwhile, a civilian with the troops screams for help and attempts to drag the seemingly lifeless body of a woman off the road and away from the creature.

She is being treated for an injured wrist and seems at odds with her impending marriage to her fiancé. After leaving the hospital, the pair board a train to reach the Mexican coast, where they plan to take a ferry to the United States. However, the pair are temporarily slowed down by the destruction of the railroad. They learn that if they do not leave the country within a few days, sea and air travel will be blocked, and they will have to wait six months before safe travel is possible. With that deadline looming, Andrew makes the decision to walk the rest of the way to the Coast and Samantha reluctantly complies. After spending the night with a generous local family, the pair make their way to the eastern gulf coast of Mexico. Arriving at the port, they learn that the last ferry will leave the next morning at 7 o'clock. Andrew is forced to buy Samantha a single ticket costing an exorbitant price of $5,000, from a dishonest ticket agent. That night, they explore the town's night-life: drinking, eating and having a good time together, but upon returning to the hotel, it soon becomes obvious Samantha wants to go to bed alone. Andrew resumes drinking heavily throughout the night after she turns him away from her room. The next morning Samantha discovers Andrew in bed with a local girl he had picked up. Shocked, she leaves the room and Andrew follows, giving the girl the opportunity to steal their passports. This means that Samantha is not able to board the ferry. Given no other option to return home, Samantha returns to the agent and barters her engagement ring for $10,000 in exchange for an escort for Andrew and her through the infected zone. Their journey takes them across the Mexican quarantine zone. Initially they travel by riverboat, where they hear and partially see the alien creatures along the way. Eventually, they are dropped off and transferred to a group of armed escorts who are to lead them overland to the US-Mexico border. While they are traveling in a convoy, it is attacked by the large aliens. As the tentacled creatures begin to demolish the other vehicles in the convoy, the escorts guarding Andrew and Samantha abandon them to try and gun down the attacking aliens. The sounds of battle soon come to an end, and Andrew and Samantha are forced to hide in silence as the creatures surround and inspect the remaining vehicles. After Andrew shuts off the light in their van, the nearby aliens ignore them. They instead destroy the remaining truck that had its headlights still on, indicating that light is of importance in some way to the aliens. When morning comes, it is evident that none of the guards has survived the ordeal, their bloodied bodies strewn across the jungle. One of the corpses is that of a female child. On finding the girl he removes two camera lenses from his bag and then pulls out a coat from deeper in the bag which he uses to cover the girl and onto which he places a yellow flower picked from the jungle. He sorrowfully documents what he sees. There is nothing in this scene which shows him taking any photographs, thereby emphasizing how his view of the matter has changed since his earlier cynical comment that a photo of a dead girl would be worth $50,000. He gingerly salvages a pair of gas masks from two of the bodies before returning to Samantha. They make a day's worth of progress before they spend the night at the top of what appears to be an Aztec pyramid with the US border wall visible on the horizon. The next day, they arrive at the checkpoint nestled in a gap in the massive wall, but it appears to be unmanned. As they cross the abandoned checkpoint and explore a nearby suburban ghost town, Andrew and Samantha realize the American border has been evacuated and the aliens have advanced into the United States. After walking along an evacuation route, the two stumble across an abandoned gas station. Andrew calls the police and is informed they will be picked up. Andrew and Samantha phone their respective families. Andrew speaks with his son, becoming visibly emotional as he does so. As they finish their calls, a lone creature silently approaches the gas station from behind. Andrew fails to notice it as he lies on the concrete of the pumping station. It sends its tentacles into the store, setting off the typical door-chime. Samantha, thinking it is Andrew coming inside to join her, looks up smiling but quickly begins to scoot away across the floor, horrified. She hides behind a set of shelves as two tentacles explore the inside of the store, getting dangerously close to her several times. They soon turn their attention to a TV that is displaying the news, pressing the tips of the appendages against the screen as pulses of light run up their lengths. Realizing their attraction to the electrically-produced light, Samantha quickly unplugs the TV and the creature loses interest in the store. The creature strides to the road beside the gas station as Samantha leaves the store to join Andrew. They both watch in amazement as a second alien appears and begins communicating with the first. Their communication appears to be more than simply vocal, as their tentacles interlace and pulse with light rhythmically. In this rare spectacle, the giant creatures no longer seem monstrous killers, but instead appear as gentle giants sharing a tender, beautiful moment. However, as quickly as they came, the creatures part ways, leaving Samantha and Andrew alone together as they wait for the military to arrive. As the convoy approaches the gas station, one of the soldiers hums Wagner's ""Ride of the Valkyries"", implying that the opening scene of the film has already shown what will happen to Andrew and Samantha after they are picked up. Watching the creatures vanish into the night, Samantha tearfully declares, ""I don't want to go home"" and they share a brief kiss before they are interrupted by the military rescue convoy."

Upon arrival, she accidentally causes all sorts of havoc with her Kryptonian-like powers until the Dark Knight catches her with a piece of Kryptonite from the ship. With Superman's help, they discover that the girl is Kara Zor-El, the niece of Jor-El and Superman/Kal-El's biological cousin. While Superman welcomes Kara with open arms and teaches her English and how to behave in society, Batman remains suspicious. Tipped off by Batman, Wonder Woman and Lyla ambush Clark Kent and Kara in a park and take Kara to Themyscira, on the basis that only there can she learn to control her powers. Superman reluctantly agrees, but still prefers to watch over Kara himself. Elsewhere, on the planet Apokolips, Darkseid learns of Kara's presence on Earth, and orders her to be captured and brought to Apokolips as a possible candidate to lead the Female Furies since the departure of Big Barda. While Batman and Superman are checking on Kara on Themyscira, a horde of Doomsday clones appears from Apokolips. Superman, Wonder Woman and the Amazonian army fight them for a while until Superman vaporizes all of them with a single blast of his heat vision, but Batman discovers that Kara is missing, and her friend Lyla who was with her has been killed by Darkseid's Omega Beams while trying to prevent her abduction. Distraught, Superman vows revenge. Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman locate and recruit Barda to help them through their way on Apokolips. Once there, Superman tears his way to Darkseid's palace while Wonder Woman and Barda go through the sewers directly into the fighting arena, where they are ambushed by Granny Goodness and the Female Furies. After a long fight, Granny and the Furies are subdued. Batman, meanwhile, makes his way underground and finds the Hell Spores, the source of the fire pits on Apokolips, and activates them. Superman encounters Darkseid, who sets the brainwashed Kara on him. Kara pummels Superman around while Darkseid watches, until Batman confronts Darkseid and informs him that he has activated the Hell Spores, all of which will destroy Apokolips. He issues Darkseid an ultimatum: free Kara and promise to leave her alone, and Batman will deactivate the Spores. Intrigued, Darkseid admits his admiration for Batman's tactics. Acknowledging that neither Superman nor Wonder Woman have the ""strength of character"" to destroy an entire planet, Darkseid relents. Superman manages to defeat Kara, and Barda and Wonder Woman present Darkseid with the subdued Granny. Defeated, Darkseid allows them to leave Apokolips. With their lives normal again, Clark decides to take Kara to meet his adoptive parents in Smallville. However, they are ambushed by Darkseid, who was waiting to kill Superman: he had promised to leave Kara alone, but not Superman or Earth. Superman is blasted into orbit by Darkseid's Omega Beams, leaving Kara to face Darkseid alone. A lengthy battle ensues with Kara  putting up a respectable fight, but Darkseid eventually overpowers her. Superman recovers and returns to Earth to confront Darkseid again. He gains the upper hand and pummels Darkseid using a combination of punches and heat vision at super speed. Darkseid grabs Superman and begins attacking him with Omega Beams. As Superman's skin starts to glow red hot from the assault, Kara uses Darkseid's Mother Box to activate a Boom Tube behind Darkseid. Superman uses the momentary distraction to his advantage and pushes Darkseid through. While Superman anticipates Darkseid's eventual return from Apokolips, Kara informs him that she changed the coordinates to a random spot in space, leaving Darkseid floating around frozen in ice. Having saved her cousin's life and found her place on Earth, Kara decides to use her powers to fight for altruism under the alias of Supergirl. She is met with applause by Wonder Woman, the Amazons, and finally, Batman. Superman and Supergirl then fly off to Metropolis."

Caesar and Marcus are trained to be warriors under the tutelage of ex-gladiator and soldier, Renius. After Caesar's father and others are killed in a slave revolt, the children go to Rome to join Caesar's uncle  Gaius Marius and the populares faction. Marius, who is consul, is waging a political war against the conservative optimates led by Cornelius Sulla, the main antagonist. After a triumph celebrating Marius' victory over African tribes, Sulla is shipped of to Asia Minor to fight Mithridates VI of Pontus. Meanwhile, Marius takes possession of Rome and Caesar falls in love with Cornelia Cinna, daughter of a populare. Marcus goes to Macedon to join a legion as he is, by his unnoble birth, not in position to become a senator. Upon Sulla's return, civil war rages  between him and Marius. By having left soldiers in Rome, Sulla succeeds in capturing the city and kills Marius when he refuses to surrender. By his dying breath, Marius asks his loyal men to defeat Sulla. After days of tough street-fighting in which Caesar is captured, Sulla emerges victor and is proclaimed dictator. He asks Caesar to join him, threatening him with torture and death if he refuses. Upon seeing the young man irresistibly wanting to turn his back on his dead uncle, Sulla lets him go. Forced to flee Rome, Caesar does so and joins the navy to go to Egypt. Meanwhile, Marcus has been victorious in campaigns against barbarians and is opted to lengthen his contract. He does so, and when asked to sign his name, reveals the surname Brutus . The book closes by Brutus being praised for his great valor. * The Death of Kings - Opening in the Aegean Sea, Caesar leads a group of men to attack a rebellious fortress in Mytilene  and he is saluted for his courage. Meanwhile, Brutus is forced to flee Greece upon having late meetings with a young woman. Accompanied by cruel but magnificent gladiator Renius, he sets off to Rome. Meanwhile, Cornelia is terrified as Sulla haunts her. Upon raping her on the night where her and Caesar's daughter Julia is born, Caesar and Brutus' friend Tubruk  kills Sulla and manages to escape uncaught though others are tortured and killed. Caesar is caught by pirates and forced to ransom 20 talents.

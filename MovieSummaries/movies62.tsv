30826749	/m/0gfg26q	Mohalla Assi	2011-08			"{""/m/03k50"": ""Hindi Language""}"	{}	{}	London architect Martin Kennedy  and his journalist wife Kate  often visit a small, remote, uninhabited island off the west coast of Scotland called Blackholme Island, for their holiday retreats. The only dwelling on the island, Fairweather Cottage, is seasonally operated by the owner Doug from the mainland and only reachable by ferry. After previously suffering a miscarriage, Kate's relationship with Martin has become tense, and in an effort to rekindle their marriage they decide on a return visit to the island. A few nights into their stay, the generator in the cottage explodes, injuring Martin's arm and leaving them without electricity. They use the CB radio, their only source of communication to the mainland, to call Doug who agrees to ferry out to help them. Kate spends the next day waiting at the jetty for Doug to arrive, but to no avail. Later a mysterious man in green combat fatigues washes up on the island, bloodied and half-conscious. When he comes round, he identifies himself as a soldier, Private Jack Coleman . He tells Martin and Kate that there has been an outbreak of an airborne disease, Argromoto Flu, codenamed R1N16, which started in South America and has spread over the entire world in the timespan of a few weeks. The virus is incurable and highly contagious, attacking the respiratory system and causing the victims to choke on blood with a 100% fatality rate. Jack says that the military has lost control, and is now advising civilians to seal themselves up in their homes and not allow anybody access. With only static now coming from the CB radio, Martin decides to play it safe and help Jack, who aggressively takes command, board up the door and the windows. Over the next few days, Jack becomes increasingly strange and erratic, and his intimidating behaviour begins to disturb the couple even further. They even suspect that the virus may not be real and Jack may be insane. When Kate asks him if he is married, he tells her his wife died of R1N16 and he becomes aggressive and threatening. Martin and Kate decide to leave the cottage and take their chances outside, but Jack refuses to let them, forcing them into the bedroom at gunpoint and locking them in. Martin sneaks outside through a skylight, finding the bodies of Doug and his wife at the pier, killed by gunshot wounds. Using Doug's hunting shotgun, Martin returns to the cottage and gets the upper hand on Jack. However, just as Kate begins to tie Jack's hands behind his back, Martin suddenly begins coughing up blood; it appears the Argromoto Flu is very real and he is infected. Kate is forced to shoot her husband dead with the shotgun, to spare him a slow and agonising death. Jack reveals to Kate that he was experimented upon at a secure military compound, from where he was released without realizing he was a carrier of R1N16. Jack infected his wife, killing her, and he fled to Blackholme Island to quarantine himself. Jack reveals the CB radio worked all along, and he just changed the settings so Kate and Martin would not be able to reach anyone. Jack fixes the CB radio and the military broadcast on it claims the soldiers have a vaccine to the virus. He tells her that the military are lying, there is no vaccine, and that the military will not allow them to leave the island alive. Kate does not believe him, and angered by the possibility that Martin could have been saved she shoots Jack dead. As she attempts to leave the island in the boat with Martin's body, a military helicopter flies over and she is killed by a sniper who shoots her in the head.

30843791	/m/0gfgt2h	The Dictator				"{""/m/06ppq"": ""Silent film""}"	{}	"{""/m/06ppq"": ""Silent film""}"	In Los Angeles in 1976, Christopher Isherwood begins writing a memoir. The film flashes back to 1931 as Christopher prepares to leave England for Germany, against the wishes of his mother Kathleen. On the train he meets Gerald Hamilton, an English ne'er-do-well of Irish descent, who suggests that Christopher take a room at the boarding house where he lives. Upon his arrival in Berlin, Christopher meets his friend Wystan Auden, who takes him to the Cosy Corner, a seedy gay club populated by hustlers. Christopher takes up residence at Gerald's boarding house under landlady Fräulein Thurau. There he becomes fast friends with Jean Ross, an aspiring actress who sings at an underground club. He also begins a tumultuous affair with Caspar, one of the rentboys from the Cosy Corner. Their relationship continues until Caspar abruptly disappears. Christopher does not see him until many months later and is horrified to see that he has joined the Nazis. To earn a living Christopher offers English lessons. One of his students is Wilfrid Landauer, the wealthy Jewish owner of a department store. He entreats Christopher to take a political stand against Nazism but Christopher, as an artist, initially demurs. Herr Landauer's home is ransacked by the Nazis and they lead a boycott against his and other Jewish-owned businesses. Christopher last sees Wilfrid when their eyes sorrowfully meet over a bonfire of books the Nazis are burning. Heinz Neddermayer, a street sweeper whom Christopher espies from a café, enters Christopher's life and they fall in love. Frau Neddermeyer looks kindly upon Christopher but Heinz's brother Gerhardt, a Nazi sympathizer, detests him. When Frau Neddermayer enters a sanatorium for treatment of tuberculosis, Gerhardt angrily advises Heinz that Christopher and Jean are no longer welcome in his home. Bobby Gilbert, the American steel heir, whom Jean had been courting to take her to Hollywood, departs Berlin suddenly, leaving Jean bereft and pregnant. She pawns her jewellery to pay for an abortion and soon after leaves Berlin as well. With the Nazis gaining in power, Christopher and Heinz decide to leave Berlin. They travel to England where Christopher tries to secure permanent residency for Heinz. Their hopes are dashed, however, when a passport officer denies Heinz a permit to remain in the country. The couple decides to travel around Europe, avoiding a return to Nazi Germany. Several years later Jean and Christopher chance upon each other in an outdoor café in England. They reminisce and he tells her that Heinz was eventually arrested and sentenced to prison, followed by a stint in the army. Jean confides that she does not miss Berlin. The scene shifts to 1952. Christopher has returned to Berlin for the first time since 1934, to write a magazine article. He reunites with Heinz who, following the partition of the city, ended up in East Berlin. He has married and has a son named Cristoph. Heinz expresses his wish that Christopher should find a family of his own and suggests that he and his family could move to America and become Christopher's family as well. Christopher refuses to commit to the idea but promises to remain in contact with Heinz. He visits his old boarding house for a joyful reunion with Fräulein Thurau, whose home ended up being in the American sector of the city. She presents him with the dolphin clock that adorned his old room, exhorting him to look at it and remember happy times. Closing titles convey that the next year, 1953, Christopher met Don Bachardy and the two remained together until Isherwood's death. Christopher and His Kind was published in 1976 and Heinz, shocked at its frankness, never communicated with Christopher again.

A man named Greg Aupolous sees this and takes a piece, not noticing the spreading green goo on it. The goo spreads to his hand, causing his veins to pop on his face and he is killed. Jake  and his younger brother Ethan are working on building an inn. They too saw the falling dish and take it to see Earl. They carefully wrap it up and go, planning to sell it for money to pay off the inn. Earl is working on another sculpture he calls Iron Golem, protector of ancient towns. Jake and Ethan sell the satellite, but for only $800. On their way from the market, Jake and Ethan see Jake's old High School Sweetheart Amanda  and her daughter Claire . Amanda says she and Claire are staying at Amanda's aunt's house, until she can figure out what to do with her divorce. The scene switches to Earl working on his statue when, without his notice, the gooed pieces fly onto the statue, infecting it. This causes the gigantic statue to spring to life, its force knocking Earl unconscious. A nearby trucker's truck stops all of a sudden, and the radio blurs. He steps out his truck to see the problem when the Iron Invader comes and kills him, the same way how Greg was killed. Amanda, her daughter Claire and her aunt are at the house when the Iron Golem attacks, killing the aunt. Amanda and Claire flee to the town, to find the sheriff. While Jake went to send a finder's fee to Greg Aupolous's house Iron came to the inn and killed Ethan. Jake returns to find Ethan dead and sees Iron walking away. Jake alerts the sheriff, but Earl also hears the report on his CB radio and they drive to the inn. Jake scolds at Earl for thinking Iron is a robot that he created when he arrived. The sheriff calls the town coroner to check on Ethan's body to see how he died and finds that his arteries and veins were infected and swelled. Jake denies the coroner's statement and goes off to hunt Iron. The sheriff returns to the police station where Amanda and Claire approach him. Soon, lights all around begin to flicker. Inside the local pub, Max, bartender Tony , and Harry see this too along with Earl in his car which suddenly died. Out the window, Tony sees Amanda, Claire and the sheriff, along with Iron coming their way. Claire turns and runs while Iron chases her. Claire falls and gets a bloody forehead. Right before Iron grabs her, Max appears and helps her escape. Jake returns in his car and sees Iron. Jake attempts to ram Iron until his car dies as well, but he managed to break off Iron's leg, causing it to fall apart. The infected pieces are still alive however, and one them grabs the sheriff and kills him. Jake gets Amanda and they and Earl hide in the pub with Tony and Harry. The kids run into Deputy Jenny , who doesn't believe the kids, who goes to see and have the kids locked in her car. While crying over the dead sheriff, Jenny is infected and dies. In the inn, the adults examine the goo covering only the blade of an ax and find out that the goo is an alien bacteria that feeds off metal, sucking the metal from human blood  killing them. Outside, Iron puts himself back together, and Claire and Max are still locked in Jenny's dead car  as Iron tries to grab Claire. She is touched, but not harmed. In the inn, they discover that, with blood, they can trick Iron into exploding. Jake and Amanda get gasoline and cover the tank with Amanda's vein blood. They plan to shoot it when Iron is close enough. With the blood, Iron is still worried about Claire. So Amanda unwraps her arm, releasing her scent of blood, attracting Iron. Max then escapes out of the car. In the inn, the infected metal ax blade puts itself into Tony's leg, killing him. Harry and Earl go through different anti-bacterial things but to no avail. But when Earl goes outside to check on Max and Amanda reenters the pub, a beer bottle spills on it and begins to dissolve. Harry then realizes that the bacteria hates alcohol when he accidentally drops his glass on the axe-head, so he and Amanda run outside with it. Iron gets close to the gasoline, Jake shoots, and he explodes. Pieces fly everywhere, knocking out Max, Earl, and Jake. A flamed piece lands on the hood of Jenny's car, and Claire barely escapes. Although a big explosion, the Pieces are still alive. Claire runs over to Max and tries to wake him up. Jake puts the beer into a spray container, and begins to spray the Pieces, killing the flames and the bacteria, while the others throw beer bottles. A little car engine makes its way to Max. Before it can infect him, Amanda appears and sprays it down. The mother and daughter are reunited. Max awakens and hugs Claire. The next morning, Jake, Amanda, and Earl go to the junkyard to crush the pieces. While doing so, Earl releases his special beer, and the three share it. Jake says the government didn't believe the story and they are coming to arrest him. Outside, he and Amanda share a kiss. Earl comes out, just in time to see the metal springing back to life, forcing Earl to break the special bottle in order to stop the last fragment. When Amanda asks if he has any more special beer to douse the yard and ensure the bacteria's destruction, he pauses, then says ""Do bears crap in the woods?"", a phrase he said early in the film."

The Pyross have red skin, and stocky, muscular features; water burns their flesh and rain is mortal to them. They use sunstones  as both money and energy source. During the rainy season, they keep locked in their city of stone and cannot get out; they protect themselves from the rain and from the wild water dragons who wander into Pyross territory during the rainy season. The Hydross, on the other part, have curvy features and blue or turquoise skin, and water is vital to them. In summer, the Hydross turn into stone statues and are thus vulnerable, while the Pyross can get out and venture into Hydross territory to destroy as many Hydross statues as they can before the rainy season starts again. The two people know very little about one another, and they cannot even touch one another, as the contact of Hydross skin burns the Pyross, and vice versa. Peace between Hydross and Pyross seems impossible, but two young people, a Pyross named Skan and a young Hydross, Kallisto, meet one another in improbable circumstances and try desperately to stop the eternal war.

In a flashback scene, Gedren murders Red Sonja's brother and parents after Sonja rejects the queen's sexual advances, and Sonja is raped by Gedren's troops. Later, Gedren's army and her aide-de-camp Ikol  attack a temple full of white-robed priestesses, who are preparing to destroy a large, glowing green orb called the Talisman, used by the Creator to forge the world. This dangerous artifact's destructive power is growing, and the priestesses intend to destroy it before it gets out of control and destroys the world. Only the priestess Varna  manages to escape and she is mortally injured. Varna encounters Lord Kalidor  and begs him to help her find her sister, Red Sonja. Kalidor finds Sonja and tells her that her sister is dying. Before dying, Varna tells Sonja what happened at the temple, and urges her to find the Talisman and destroy it. Sonja begins a journey to Berkubane, Gedren's Kingdom of Eternal Night. Sonja sees a storm in the distance, indicating that someone is using the Talisman. Kalidor offers to help her, but Sonja rejects his offer and rides to the now-ruined kingdom of Hablock. There she meets the young Prince Tarn  and his servant, Falkon . They tell her that Gedren wiped out Hablock and its army with the Talisman because Tarn refused to surrender. Tarn announces that he is raising a new army to crush Gedren and invites Sonja to work for him as a cook. She declines and goes her own way. Sonja kills Lord Brytag  after he refuses her passage through the mountain passes. His troops surround Sonja, and Kalidor, who has secretly been following her, attacks their rear, allowing Sonja to escape. Sonja comes across Tarn and Falkon in the mountains. Tarn is being tortured by bandits. Falkon rejoins Sonja to help her kill the brigands and free the prince. They travel onward toward Berkubane. At Castle Berkubane, Gedren and Ikol watch Sonja and her party approaching on a magic screen. Gedren recognizes Sonja and orders that she be brought back to the fortress unharmed. She and Ikol use the Talisman to conjure up a storm, forcing Sonja's band to take shelter in a watery cavern. Gedren unleashes an ""Icthyan Killing Machine"" in the cavern. Kalidor reappears, and helps Sonja blind the beast. Sonja now accepts Kalidor's company, but also warns him that ""no man can have her"" unless he can defeat her in a swordfight. Kalidor challenges her and they fight to a draw. Kalidor, Sonja and Falkon then infiltrate Castle Berkubane. To protect Tarn, they convince him to stay behind in order to prevent Gedren from escaping. Sonja confronts Gedren, while Kalidor and Falkon deal with her guards in the castle's dining hall. Ikol tries to escape with gold looted from Hablock, but is stopped by Prince Tarn, who accidentally kills him. The Talisman, which Gedren has placed in a Chamber of Lights, is becoming too powerful to control. Its power breaks the floor open, revealing a chasm of molten lava beneath the castle. Sonja and Gedren fight in the Chamber, and Gedren falls into the chasm. Sonja throws the Talisman in after her, destroying it and starting a chain reaction that tears Castle Berkubane apart.

The scientists responsible for these creations are congratulated by their employer, Mr. Jaguar, who plans to make these ""Bio-Humans"" into the strongest fighters on Earth. Despite warnings from his cousin, Men-Men, Jaguar laughs maniacally as Broly wags his furry tail in his tank. As Hercule  hasn't yet paid Android 18 the prize money she demanded for letting him beat her in the 25th World Martial Arts Tournament, she begins smashing Mr. Satan's mansion up, particularly his undeserved prizes from the tournament. Hercule, cowering, tries to tell 18 that he hasn't get the money yet, but she doesn't believe him, and continues to ransack his home. His screams of fright are heard by Goten, Trunks, Krillin, and Marron, who are waiting for 18. Hercule is visited by Men-Men, who claims to be the cousin of hercule's old martial arts rival, Jaguar. It seems that Jaguar is blackmailing Hercule into visiting his laboratory island to fight his bio-fighters. Hercule agrees, and departs with Men-Men, followed by Goten, Trunks and 18; 18 to ensure that Hercule does not cheat her again, and Goten and Trunks out of excitement over the Bio-Warriors. Upon arriving, Hercule is coldly greeted by Jaguar, who sets up a tournament for him to fight the bio-fighters, but when they demonstrate their incredible fighting abilities, they are more than which Hercule can handle, Goten, Trunks, and 18 intervene. Goten and Trunks are then confronted by a familiar face: The Priest from Natade Village whom they met in the previous movie. Enraged, Jaguar reveals his greatest weapon: a Super Bio-Fighter. But when Goten and Trunks see the Super Bio-Fighter, they recognize him as none other than the Legendary Super Saiyan himself, Broly. They confront the priest, who tells them that he sold Broly's frozen blood to Jaguar, and that the Super Bio-Fighter is Broly's clone. Goten and Trunks prepare to destroy Broly before he can be revived, but seeing Goten has already awakened Broly's Saiyan instincts and his vengeance against Goku. He breaks out of stasis, only to be drenched in the bio-liquid and turns into a horribly deformed, slime covered bio-mutant, giving him the name Bio-Broly. Jaguar commands Bio-Broly to attack Hercule, but 18 intervenes at the last minute, only to get pounded by the Bio-Saiyan. Just before Bio-Broly can kill Hercule, Trunks intervenes and save him in time. They then attack Bio-Broly head-on, and prove to be an equal match for the Bio-Saiyan, until Goten abandons the battle to save trapped scientists from the flooding of a dangerous bio-liquid which absorbs anything with a different genetic structure to its own and grows stronger. As Bio-Broly pounds Trunks around, 18 recovers and tries to stop him, but she too is beaten. Just before Bio-Broly can kill her, Krillin shows up in time and rescues 18, but Bio-Broly finds them both and almost kills them. Goten and Trunks then fight Bio-Broly again, but they get seriously pounded, and Bio-Broly almost kills Goten until Trunks devises a way to get rid of the menace. Trunks manages to lure Bio-Broly into a corner, where he blasts the bio-liquid tanks, causing them to shower on Bio-Broly and supposedly melt him. Unfortunately, this only makes the bio-liquid more powerful and his power rises, and it soon starts to flood the entire island, and possibly the whole planet. Goten, Trunks, Krillin and 18 manage to get as many people as they can out of the lab, including the reluctant Jaguar and Men-Men, who want to die shamefully along with their deadly creations, but Trunks rescues them anyway, and Hercule manages to escape by jumping into the water. To everyone's surprise, the bio-liquid seems to be solidifying by touching the sea water, so Goten, Trunks and Krillin use a triple Kamehameha Wave to blast the water by the island so high that the entire island is flooded with sea water, which solidifies all the bio-liquid. Unfortunately, the celebrations are cut short when Bio-Broly emerges from the sea as a giant. However, as fast as Bio-Broly emerges, he then turns to stone, due to having been drenched in sea water. Seeing their chance, Goten and Trunks blast the gigantic Bio-Broly statue into oblivion, ridding of Broly for good. Hercule emerges from the sea water, calling for help. Laughing, 18 says that she will help him if he promises to pay her 100,000,000 zeni. Fuming, Hercule swims off. In the Other World, Goku is informed that Broly  is causing trouble in Hell. Along with Pikkon, Goku is sent to stop Broly but instead he gives it a while longer as he continues to eat.

Dominick is a time traveller whose job is to observe transport systems on the 'flipside' - the era before the Time Barrier was broken. Dominick's 'Circuit'  is London 1980, where he believes he may have an ancestor - his great-great-grandfather, also named Dominick Hide. Breaking the rules, Dominick lands on the flipside to search for his great-great-grandfather. London of 1980 is a very different place to London 2130, and Dominick is completely unprepared for the amazing culture shock of Portobello Road. He has no money, and almost no idea how to behave. He concocts a story about finding a 'distant relative', and to avoid suspicion, calls himself Gilbey, after a brand of Gin. While he is on the flipside, he relies entirely on the kindness of strangers, including the owner of a clothes shop, Jane Winters. After an unsuccessful visit to the flipside, Dominick returns to 2130 determined to try again. Dominick tells his wife, Ava, that he plans to visit the flipside. She is upset and confused, and asks him not to go. Despite the risks involved, and the promise of trouble from his superior, Caleb Line, Dominick visits the flipside again. While he is there, and against all sense, Dominick begins a relationship with Jane. Still Dominick has not found his great-great-grandfather, but now his visits seem to be more concerned with seeing Jane than with finding the elusive 1980 Dominick. They spend a weekend together at a guesthouse in Herne Bay where his flying saucer has been taken. As a result, Jane becomes pregnant. When Dominick learns this, he goes to Caleb Line to admit his guilt, whatever the consequences. Caleb reveals that this he was aware, all the time, of what Dominick was doing. He sanctioned it because Dominick Hide is the victim of a ""genetic time-slip"" - he is, in fact, his own ancestor. The child Jane is carrying will be Dominick's great-grandfather. Caleb tells Dominick that further landings on the flipside will not be permitted, officially, implying that he trusts Dominick enough to turn a blind eye to further landings. However, having narrowly avoided causing a fatal accident on a previous landing, Dominick realises the danger involved, and decides to visit the flipside just once more, where he provides for Jane and his son by fetching them the following week's newspaper, from which Jane can use the soccer results to win the football pools. He explains that this will be the last time he can visit the flipside and says a sad farewell to his great-great-grandmother. Jane watches Dominick take off in his flying saucer, convinced at last that his story is true. The closing credits show Dominick and Ava walking and laughing in the surf at Herne Bay with their own baby."

Caleb tells Dominick that further landings on the flipside will not be permitted, officially, implying that he trusts Dominick enough to turn a blind eye to further landings. However, having narrowly avoided causing a fatal accident on a previous landing, Dominick realises the danger involved, and decides to visit the flipside just once more, where he provides for Jane and his son by fetching them the following week's newspaper, from which Jane can use the soccer results to win the football pools. He explains that this will be the last time he can visit the flipside and says a sad farewell to his great-great-grandmother. Jane watches Dominick take off in his flying saucer, convinced at last that his story is true. The closing credits show Dominick and Ava walking and laughing in the surf at Herne Bay with their own baby."

Four scars, the mark of the Four War Gods , appear on all of the children's backs except for the youngest girl, Ai. Asagi, the oldest, tells Ai to leave the island while she still does not bear the mark and says her goodbye. The Four War Gods find out that Ai has escaped and try to retrieve her, but InuYasha and the others defeat Goura and save Ai, who later asks InuYasha to save the others on Horai Island. Later, while Ai rests, InuYasha explains the myth of Horai Island, a place that appears once every fifty years. He remembers fifty years ago, when Kikyo took him to the island to meet the half-demon children. Suddenly, the Four War Gods appeared. Gora sucked some of Kikyo's blood , and Ryuura marks InuYasha's back with the scar, saying that he would never be free from them once he has the scar on him. The gang decides to head to Horai Island to investigate. The villagers panic upon seeing the island. In a small hut, Kikyo listens to a man's tale of Horai Island, then leaves, saying she will defeat the demons. The rest of the villagers rush to the shrine and start praying for divine protection when Kyoura appears, who proceeds to burn down the shrine and kill many of the villagers. Sesshomaru arrives and drives Kyoura off with his Dragon Strike. After the battle, he remembers back to his first encounter with Kyoura, when he was marked by the scar. As InuYasha and company near the island, Juura appears and fires his Thunder Cannon at them, destroying their boat. Miroku and Sango fly away on Kirara, pursued by Juura, while InuYasha, Kagome and Ai escape to the beach, where they meet Ryuura. In the ensuing fight, Ryuura easily deflects InuYasha's Wind Scar with his Earth Dragon Gale, then calls upon his Dragon Lightning and nearly kills InuYasha, but Kagome stops him by firing a sacred arrow. Ryuura is forced to retreat, but not before he hurls some insults at InuYasha. Ai leads the group to the village, where they find Asagi singing the ""Song of Parting."" together with the other four children. When InuYasha reveals his plan to confront the Four War Gods, Asagi begs him to reconsider, saying they'll all be killed. The gang learns that Asagi is going to sacrifice herself to the Cauldron of Resonance, and she argues that her death will allow the others to live a little longer. They all follow Asagi to the Cauldron, where InuYasha attempts to destroy the Cauldron with no success. Suddenly, he and Asagi are pulled into the Cauldron as it closes. On the outside, the rest of the gang and the children try to open the doors, while on the inside, InuYasha feels his strength waning. Then, Lady Kanade, the priestess who fought the Four War Gods fifty years ago, appears and lends her strength to InuYasha, along with the War Gods' power spheres, telling him to destroy it as soon as possible, and that it must never be opened. In return, she asks InuYasha to save the children, then gives her blessing to Asagi before she disappears. InuYasha calls upon Adamant Barrage and destroys the door to the Cauldron, accidentally breaking Kagome's bow in the process. Just then, a Kikyo look-alike appears and takes the power spheres from InuYasha. He chases her to the War Gods, where she opens the box, releasing the spheres to their owners. While Kagome, Shippo and the children attempt to make a raft to escape, the Kikyo doppelganger attacks InuYasha. At the Cauldron of Resonance, Sesshomaru appears and finds Kyoura waiting for him. Sesshomaru easily defeats him with another Dragon Strike. Meanwhile, Miroku and Sango fly on Kirara to confront Juura and the resurrected Goura. Using his Wind Tunnel, Miroku redirects Goura's blasts so that it hits Juura, before Sango finishes him off with Hiraikotsu. Meanwhile, InuYasha battles with the Kikyo doppelganger and is about to lose when the true Kikyo appears and defeats the impostor, then leaves her bow behind. InuYasha finds Ryuura attacking Kagome and the children, and kills him with his Wind Scar. With only Goura remaining, Miroku spears Gora's head with his staff, greatly weakening it. With InuYasha's Backlash Wave, he kills the last War God. However, the battle does not end here. All the power spheres combine to create one final War God who seems unstoppable. Kagome knows only a combination of her sacred arrow and InuYasha's Backlash Wave can destroy it, but she cannot fight because her bow was broken. However, the fireflies  lead the children to Kikyo's bow, and they bring it to Kagome. Finally, Kagome's arrow purified the War Gods's attack and, with the fireflies' blessing, InuYasha unleashes his Backlash Wave plus the addition of his Adamant Barrage, which killed them. As the gang and the children leave the island, watching as the island vanish in to the broken time line and Disappearing out of sight, putting the myth of Horai Island to rest. As the credits roll, it is indicated that the children spend some time with the gang at Kaede's village before departing as a group of six to face the world by themselves."

However, while trying to finish by stealing a can of ""Spuddies"" potato chips, he wakes Vincent and loses both the food and the red wagon that it's on when a truck runs it over. Hastily, he promises to replace everything by the time Vincent reawakens in a week. Meanwhile, a group of forest animals, led by Verne the box turtle, emerge from hibernation to find their food cache nearly empty. They begin foraging but find a large hedge blocking their way. Verne investigates, discovering a human residential community which confuses and frightens him. RJ, who sees the entire commotion, convinces the other animals it's easier to raid the humans' garbage for food rather than forage for it, and they manage to get enough food to keep them from starving. Verne, however, remains wary, especially after homeowner Gladys Sharp discovers the animals in her yard, chases them out through the hedge, and hires VermTech exterminator Dwayne LaFontant to keep them out. Worried for his family's safety, Verne decides to return the food to the humans. RJ tries to stop him, resulting in an argument between the two. This attracts the attention of a playful Rottweiler, who chases them across several lawns before all of the food the animals gathered is destroyed. RJ then blames Verne who, while trying to defend himself, makes a comment that hurts the others' feelings. RJ helps Verne reconcile with the others. He also discovers that Gladys has just restocked her pantry with a large food supply for an upcoming party and concocts a plan to get past the exterminator-planted boobytraps in her yard. Working together under cover of darkness, the animals get the food. RJ and Verne get into another argument, again over a can of ""Spuddies"", during which Verne  learn of RJ's true motives. Gladys wakes up, discovers the animals in her house, and calls VermTech. Dwayne arrives and traps the animals except for RJ, who escapes with the food. RJ takes the food to a now-awake Vincent, but when the latter points out RJ's treachery, the raccoon decides to sacrifice the food to save his friends. This angers Vincent, who chases RJ as he pursues Dwayne's truck. Verne is happy to see RJ again but the others no longer trust him since he abandoned them. They nearly thwart RJ's efforts to help before Verne finally convinces them otherwise. The animals then subdue Dwayne and turn his truck toward home, but the truck goes out of control and demolishes Gladys' house. The animals hide in the hedge, trapped by Vincent on one side and Dwayne and Gladys on the other. RJ and Verne get an idea to give Hammy the hyperactive squirrel his first ever can of energy drink, which puts him into overdrive. Exceeding the speed of light, Hammy activates an illegal trap that Dwayne had installed , capturing Vincent, Dwayne and Gladys. Gladys and Vincent are taken into custody by the police and a wilderness preservation group, respectively, while Dwayne escapes after taking advantage of Gladys' attempt at fighting a police officer and resisting arrest, only to encounter the same Rottweiler that chased RJ and Verne earlier. Back in the forest, Verne tells RJ that if he'd explained what he was trying to do in the first place, the others would have helped because ""that's what families do,"" and welcomes him back to the family. The animals also find that while Hammy was in his caffeine-charged state, he had refilled their food cache with nuts to satisfy them for the year. In a post-credits scene, the animals go to the vending machine seen in the beginning of the film and cause every product to fall into the access bin. However, the amount of snacks prevents the access door from opening, prompting Hammy to remark that this is ""kind of anti-climatic."""

Despite being in their twenties, Sonny and Girly act like prepubescent children, dressing in English school uniforms and sleeping in giant cribs in a room full of toys. The family's lives are built around an elaborate role-playing fantasy, called ""The Game"", which is structured around a set of ill-defined yet strictly enforced rules. Because a rich childhood is incomplete without friends, Sonny and Girly regularly seek out male loners, the homeless, and hippies to lure back to their house , where they are then forced to play ""The Game"". Should the ""new friends"" refuse, they are ""put on trial"" and then ""sent to the angels""-- a euphemism for being made the victim in snuff films produced by Sonny in which he ritualistically hunts down and murders the men on the manor grounds.

The prostitute—rechristened ""New Friend""-- is outfitted in schoolboy clothes and subjected to an indeterminate period of torment ""playing the game,"" during which he is repeatedly presented with his client's body as a reminder that the family has incriminating information about him. After Mumsy makes sexual overtures to New Friend one evening, he gets the idea to turn the family against itself. ""New Friend's"" plot succeeds, as he creates sexual jealousy between the women after first sleeping with Mumsy and then Girly. Sonny, left out of the sexual politics, petitions to have New Friend ""sent to the angels,"" resulting in Girly bludgeoning him to death with an antique mirror. Nanny attempts to secure New Friend for herself by murdering Mumsy with acid-tipped needles, but the attempt fails and Girly hacks Nanny to death with an axe and cooks her head for use in baked goods. Rather than turn on one another, Mumsy and Girly declare a truce, deciding to ""share"" New Friend by alternating what days of the week each woman will be permitted to have sex with him. The two women agree, though ponder what will happen should either of them ever become bored with New Friend, with Mumsy declaring it as an inevitability. Preparing for this day, New Friend settles into Mumsy's room with the acid-tipped needles Nanny had attempted to kill Mumsy with, content to bide his time enjoying the women's company."

On the eve of the graduation parade, Brian Moreland meets privately with the academy commander, retired Brigadier General Harlan Bache, who promotes him to Cadet Major, the highest cadet rank in the academy. Brian is well-liked and respected by almost everyone, especially his fellow officers Cadet Captain Alex Dwyer and Cadet 1st Lieutenant Edward West. The next day at the parade, General Bache announces that the school's board of trustees has decided to sell the school to real estate developers, but that they will remain open for one more year, giving many at Bunker Hill hope that the school can be saved. A dance is held at the academy after commencement. As the cadets arrive with their dates, a group of local teenagers outside the gates harass them verbally. A brawl breaks out when Moreland tries to take control of the situation, and when General Bache follows him and attempts to end the fight, his service pistol is seized by one of the local boys and goes off. One of the townies is killed, and Bache is arrested. Before he can be charged with manslaughter, the cadets find out that Bache has suffered a heart attack and is in critical condition at a local hospital. In the wake of the incident, the board decides to close the school immediately. Cadet Major Moreland meets with his officers and they unanimously decide to take control of the campus. When the Dean of Students arrives with the local sheriff to empty the armory the weapons are already gone, and they are met by Moreland and a cadre of armed cadets. The cadets demand that they be allowed to meet with General Bache and negotiate with the board of trustees to keep the school open. The school staff and the sheriff are escorted to a school bus and allowed to leave, since Moreland refuses to hold them as hostages, and armed cadets secure the perimeter against any attempt to retake the campus in the meantime. Another group of cadets have been sent to a local food supply warehouse to restock their provisions but one of their trucks breaks down on the way back. As Cadet Captain Dwyer attempts to fix the engine, a group of townies threatens them with another fight until hotheaded Cadet Captain David Shawn opens fire with his M16, shooting several bursts into the air. The townies scatter and the cadets abandon the stalled truck, fleeing the scene in the second truck and ramming a police car in the process. The police surround the campus, but Moreland maintains order and initially morale is high. A delegation of parents soon arrives, led by Brian's father, an Army Master Sergeant, who tries to save face by telling Brian that he's made his point and it's time to end the standoff. The two argue, and after his father slaps him, Moreland orders the delegation escorted from the campus. To demonstrate to the police and parents that none of the boys are being held against their will, Moreland assembles the cadets and offers them a chance to walk out. All of them choose to stay. The siege grows more tense when the National Guard arrives. The commander, Colonel Kerby, negotiates with Cadet Major Moreland with greater diplomacy and patience than his father had, but with no more success. Although Kerby admits to Moreland he admires an institution like Bunker Hill, he explains that he is accountable to the state legislature, which has been inundated with complaints and fears from locals and parents. At the next morning muster the officers report that eleven cadets have climbed the walls overnight to return home. Moreland assembles the entire battalion and again offers any cadets who wish the opportunity to leave the campus. At least half of the remaining cadets drop their weapons and walk out, including Moreland’s friend Lieutenant Edward West. As the siege continues, food is running out and the water is turned off. When the electricity is turned off, one of the cadets is severely burned as they attempt to restart the school's old gasoline powered generator. They permit an ambulance to enter and take the injured boy to a hospital, and afterwards, Moreland offers to stand down if the order comes from General Bache. Kerby replies that Bache had died the previous night. The cadets, deeply hurt by Bache's death, hold a military memorial service in his honor. One night, an M48 Patton tank rolls up to the main gate and scans the immediate area. One of the youngest cadets, on sentry duty near the gate, panics and runs out to surrender. He drops his weapon, which fires upon hitting the ground. Nervous National Guard soldiers open fire, killing the cadet's companion, Charlie Auden, who had tried to go after him. Charlie's death weakens Moreland’s resolve considerably and, after conferring with Dwyer, he decides to end the occupation. He calls all the cadets to muster and orders them to surrender. But the rebellious David Shawn starts shooting and firefight ensues. Dwyer and Moreland run to Shawn's room, hoping to stop him, as police and National Guard invade the grounds. Shawn and Moreland are killed by suppressing fire from the Patton tank, and the fight ends abruptly as Colonel Kerby takes command of the campus. Accompanied by a saddened Colonel Kerby, Dwyer carries Moreland's body out of the school, followed by the surviving cadets, as well as the National Guardsmen, Army and local law enforcement personnel. Last, we see a flashback of prouder times at Bunker Hill as General Bache reviews a parade of cadets.

Elgin asks for the assistance of researchers Roy  and Gerry Bennett  because they respect Cole's wish to avoid using cyanide to poison the rabbits. Roy proposes using hormones to disrupt the rabbits' breeding cycle, and takes some rabbits for experimentation. One rabbit is injected with a new serum believed to cause birth defects. However, the Bennett's daughter Amanda  loves the injected rabbit, so she switches it with one from the control group. Amanda is then given the injected rabbit as a pet, but it soon escapes. While inspecting the rabbits' old burrowing areas, Cole and the Bennets find a large, unusual animal track. Meanwhile, Cole's son Jackie  and Amanda go to a gold mine to visit Jackie's friend Billy, but find him missing. Jackie finds more of the animal tracks in Billy's shed, while Amanda goes into the mine and runs into an enormous rabbit with blood on its face. Screaming in terror, she runs from the mine. Mutilated bodies begin to crop up around town, including Billy, a truck driver, and a family of four. Elgin, the Bennets, Cole, and Cole's two ranch hands, Frank ([[Henry Wills  and Jud , go to the mine to try to kill the rabbits with explosives. As Elgin and Cole set charges on top of the mine, Roy and Frank enter the shaft to get pictorial evidence. Outside, a rabbit surfaces and attacks Jud before Gerry can shoot it. Roy and Frank escape the rabbits in the mine and run outside as the explosives are detonated. The explosives fail to kill the rabbits, and that night they attack Cole's ranch, killing Jud while Cole, Frank, Jackie, and Cole's housekeeper escape into the storm shelter. The rabbits make their way to the small town of Galanos, killing everyone they find before taking refuge in the buildings for the day. In the morning, Gerry and Amanda leave to avoid the coming press, but get stuck along a sandy stretch of road. Roy and Elgin update Sheriff Cody  on the situation, and after realizing the rabbits have escaped the mine, call in the national guard. As night falls, the rabbits leave Galanos to continue making their way to the main town, Ajo, killing everything in sight. Cole proposes using a half-mile wide stretch of electrified railroad track as a fence to contain and kill the rabbits. They recruit a large group of people at a drive in theater to help herd the rabbits with their car lights, with assistance from the machine gun fire of the national guard. Thousands of rabbits make their way into the trap, where they are shot and electrocuted. At the end of the film, Cole tells Roy that normal rabbits, as well as coyotes, have returned to the ranch.

In the first episode, Words, we meet Kiril, a young monk who has taken a vow of silence, who stands up for Zamira, a young Albanian girl who is accused of murder and is on the run from a mob. For her sake, Kiril leaves the monastery and the two of them make their way through the Macedonian landscape, but their romance is heading towards a sudden and brutal end. Faces is set in bustling and trendy London. Anne, a picture editor, is torn between the love of her husband Nick and the attraction she feels for Aleksandar, a disillusioned war photographer. She is pulled into a series of tragic events by a shoot-out at a nearby restaurant. The third and final story, Pictures, brings the two previous stories together. It focuses on Aleksandar's return to Macedonia to settle. He learns that the war has divided his home village and that his Albanian neighbours are now seen as enemies. Hana, an Albanian woman he was, and apparently still is, in love with, asks him to take care of her daughter Zamira. While Aleksandar sets out to find the girl, a storm is building on the horizon, and the film returns us to its beginning.  Upon watching the film, it becomes clear that the sequence could have been any of three  - though somewhere an intended inconsistency will become apparent. The end of Words sees Zamira gunned down and killed by her family when she tries to escape them - photos of the scene make a passive appearance in Faces. Suddenly the reappearance of Zamira in Pictures coupled with the ending which returns to the beginning could temporarily hoodwink the viewer that this is, in fact, the first part of the film - until a very close observation of the man lying dead at the beginning of Words is Aleksandar Kirkov, all while Zamira is running for her life after having killed one of the Macedonians. Faces set in London has a living Aleksandar Kirkov whose close friend Anne is developing black and white pictures of a dead Zamira. The motto of the film was, ""The Circle is not Round"" seen in graffiti form on a wall during Pictures but actually stands to deliver a message that in life, people and places may change but overshadowing scenarios  go backward and forward in a cycle."

Tiffany , a former lover and accomplice of serial killer Charles Lee Ray , acquires Chucky's remains  after bribing and later murdering a police officer who removed the dismembered ""Good Guy"" doll parts from an evidence locker by slashing his throat. Believing Ray's soul to still be inhabiting the doll, Tiffany crudely stitches Chucky back together and reenacts the voodoo ritual which instilled Ray inside the doll a decade ago. Though her chants initially fail to produce results, Chucky unexpectedly springs to life and kills Tiffany's goth-wannabe admirer, Damien , torturing him by ripping off his labret piercing while his hands and feet are cuffed, and suffocating him with a pillow while Tiffany watches with excitement. Tiffany and Chucky then get into an argument because Tiffany believed Chucky wished to marry her. Upon learning he had no intention of doing so, Tiffany throws him in a playpen she built for a nursery and locks him in it. She then later gives him another doll in a wedding dress with a real diamond ring to mock him. While Tiffany is watching TV while taking a bath, Chucky escapes by cutting through the wood of the play pen with the diamond part of the ring and kills her by pushing the TV into the bath. Then, using the same voodoo spell, Chucky gains further revenge against Tiffany by transferring her soul into a female doll so she could feel what Chucky went through as a living doll. Chucky, who is still intent on becoming human again, concocts a plan with Tiffany to retrieve an amulet that was buried with Ray's body and use the bodies of Tiffany's neighbor Jesse  and his girlfriend Jade  as a means to return to their normal lives. Tiffany sends Jesse a message asking him to take the two dolls to New Jersey in exchange for cash. Jesse convinces Jade to go with him and helps her pack. Meanwhile, Jade's police-officer uncle Warren  breaks into Jesse's car and plants a bag of marijuana to frame Jesse, whom he dislikes. Afraid of him ruining their plans, Chucky and Tiffany kill him by setting up an airbag to launch nails into his face. After the dolls hide the body under the backseat, Jesse and Jade return and begin their trip. Outside a convenience store, they are pulled over by Officer Norton, who asks to search Jesse's car for the planted drugs. After he finds it, he goes to his car to report to Warren. During this time, Chucky crawls over and shoves a cloth into Norton's gas tank and lights it. Norton is killed when his car explodes and, seeing the explosion, Jesse and Jade flee the scene. Soon, they stop at a wedding chapel/hotel and are married. During that time, Jade's uncle, still alive, tries to run away but is stabbed numerous times in the back by Chucky. While in the hotel, Jesse and Jade meet a con-artist couple Russ and Diane  who steal Jesse's money. As the criminals have sex in their room, Tiffany, who had seen them take Jesse's money and said how the woman ""doesn't deserve to wear that ring"", takes their bottle of champagne and throws it into the mirrored ceiling, sending down shards of glass and killing the two con-artists. Impressed at what she just did, Chucky reveals his true feelings for Tiffany, and then proposes to her. After accepting and putting on the ring, both dolls begin to have sex. The next morning, a maid  finds the corpses of the couple and Jesse and Jade drive away with their best friend David, who knew about their plan to elope and heard about the recent murders. He reveals that Jesse and Jade have been pinned for all of the deaths and, while searching for the source of a foul smell, finds Warren's body and demands that Jesse pull over. While he is confronting them, the dolls come alive and hold them hostage with guns, demanding for them to keep driving. David turns and is accidentally broken by a truck that taxes speeding, horrifying Jade and Jesse. Jesse and Jade drive away with the dolls. They are then chased by police, which Chucky is able to shoot the cars and make them go off the road. During that time, the dolls reveal their plan to them and get Jesse to drive in a mobile home to keep the cops off them by using a different vehicle. While preparing Jade for the body-switch, Tiffany begins talking with Jade, who manages to turn Tiffany against Chucky. A fight between the two dolls ensues and Jade seizes an opportunity by kicking and locking Tiffany into the oven while Jesse pushes Chucky out the window. Chucky shoots at Jesse, causing the RV to run off the road and into a ditch. Chucky finds Jade and forces her to take him to his grave site, while Jesse takes a weak Tiffany  and follows them. While the medical examiner is digging, Chucky shoots him in the back of the head and orders Jade to open the casket and give him the amulet. After she breaks it off his skeleton's neck, she throws it out at him. Jesse then appears with Tiffany and they trade hostages. While Jesse and Jade embrace, Chucky is about to throw his knife at Jade until Jesse sees and turns her around; being stabbed in the back. After Jade pulls the knife out of his back and holds him, they are tied up for the ritual. Before Chucky starts the body-switching chant, Tiffany distracts him by kissing him while she pulls the knife out of his pocket, stabbing him in his back. They fight until he stabs her in the heart, where she collapses to the ground. While distracted, Jesse knocks Chucky into his grave who demands to be let out. A private investigator arrives to see Jade pointing a gun into the hole. He sees Chucky and is clearly shocked by what he sees. The investigator then watches Jade shoot Chucky several times while he yells he'll come back as he always comes back. The investigator soon gets on the phone with the police, saying that Jesse and Jade are innocent of the murders and sends the couple away. While stumbling upon and investigating Tiffany's doll body, Tiffany suddenly springs to life and gives birth to a doll child before finally dying. The baby seems to attack the investigator as the film ends, thus setting the scene for Seed of Chucky to begin."

Lange , a mild-mannered clerk at a publishing company who dreams of writing Western stories. He gets his chance when Batala , the salacious head of the company, fakes his own death and the abandoned workers decide to form a cooperative. They have great success with Lange's stories about the cowboy, Arizona Jim — whose stories parallel the real-life experiences of the cooperative. At the same time, Lange and his neighbor, Valentine , fall in love. When Batala returns from the ""dead"", intending to reclaim the publishing company, Lange shoots and kills him . Lange and Valentine flee to escape the country, stopping at an inn near the Belgian border. Here, Valentine tells Lange's story to a group of the inn's patrons, who had recognized Lange as the ""murderer on the run"" and threatened to turn him in to the police. After the story is through, the men sympathize with Lange and decide to allow him to escape across the border to freedom."

Among the plan's stages are the procurement of a sketch of a new toy; the development of ""Synthodrones"", advanced androids; and a bizarre research project investigating the lifestyles of teenage girls. Meanwhile, Kim realizes that her crime-fighting lifestyle has prevented her from having a steady boyfriend and that Ron may be her only prospect for the upcoming junior prom, a distasteful prospect in the eyes of the other cheerleaders. However, Ron introduces Kim to Eric , a new student, and Kim and Eric are instantly attracted to each other. As their relationship progresses, Ron finds himself increasingly on the sidelines of Kim's life. He also realizes his own romantic feelings for Kim, but decides not to tell her for fear of harming their platonic friendship. Ron is also annoyed by the numerous changes the new owners of Bueno Nacho, his favorite fast-food chain, have been making. To complete the final stage in his master plan, Drakken kidnaps Kim's father, Dr. James Possible, a scientist who possesses the most advanced ""cybertronic technology"" in existence. Although Kim and Ron manage to rescue Dr. Possible, Drakken escapes and continues to confuse everyone with his scheme, which now includes board meetings at a company he recently acquired. Bueno Nacho has introduced their first kiddie meals, which come with a small, toy robot-figure called ""Little Diablo"". The Little Diablos are a worldwide popular sensation, and children all over the world are grabbing them. Kim realizes Ron's growing unhappiness and tries to have a heart-to-heart talk with him, explaining that things are changing and it's time to move on in life. While Kim and Eric attend Prom, Ron decides to take Rufus, his naked mole rat, to Bueno Nacho. There, he is distressed to find the bendy straws have been taken away and decides it is time to complain to the new owner of Bueno Nacho. When he is connected, Ron discovers the new owner is Dr. Drakken, who has imbedded cybertronic technology into each Little Diablo. Bueno Nacho's new manager, an agent of Drakken's, activates the army of Little Diablos which attack Ron and Rufus. Eluding the pursuing Diablos, Ron bursts into the prom insisting that the tiny dolls are evil. While most dismiss him as crazy, Kim decides to investigate his claims, and despite the protests of Eric, contacts Wade, who confirms what Ron said. His plans close to being exposed, Drakken unleashes a direct attack on Middleton. Kim's brothers' own Little Diablos transform into giant, armed robots. With help from the Possible family, Kim and Ron succeed in defeating the robot attack. However, Drakken then reveals to Kim that he has captured Eric, and demands her surrender in exchange for Eric's safety. Enraged, Kim dons a new, experimental high tech battle-suit, despite warnings from Wade and heads off with Ron to Drakken's current lair, Bueno Nacho's corporate headquarters. Kim and Shego battle while Ron takes care of Drakken's Sumo Ninja. After defeating Shego, Kim is happy when she sees Eric walking towards her, unharmed and hugs him. Eric then reveals that he is actually one of Drakken's Synthadrones and shocks Kim with a blast of electricity, rendering her unconscious. Ron charges at Eric in anger, but Shego knocks him out. The entire world is soon under attack from armies of the giant Diablo robots. Ron and Kim awake up in a storage room tied up. Kim, heartbroken, humiliated and depressed, is close to conceding defeat, thinking that there isn't a boy for her in the world, but Ron encourages her and ends up revealing his true and deep romantic feelings for her, making Kim realize that she, too, returns his romantic affections. With Rufus's help, they escape and head up to the roof to destroy the master signal tower controlling the Diablos. Shego and Eric attempt to stop them, but Kim manages to fight off Shego and Rufus kills Eric by puncturing Eric's foot and draining his ""syntho-ooze"". The Diablos deactivated, Drakken attempts to flee, but Ron cuts him off, saying that he crossed the line when he messed with Bueno Nacho. Drakken begs for mercy and Ron forces him to finally say his name. Drakken and his goons are taken into custody  and the media broadcasts the news of Kim and Ron's victory. Kim and Ron return to the Prom holding hands and everyone pauses to look at them. Bonnie tries to make fun of them, but everyone else starts to cheer as the next song  begins to play. Kim and Ron sheepishly stand there, not sure what to do until Rufus pushes them closer together. Ron holds out his hand for Kim and they head out onto the dance floor and have a slow dance. They pause during the dance and smile at each other before sharing their first passionate kiss."

It tells about the exploitation of working-class fishermen, specifically that of the eldest son of a very traditional village family, the Valastros. 'Ntoni convinces his family to mortgage their house in order to catch and sell fish themselves and make more money than they were already receiving from the wholesalers who had controlled the market with their low prices for a long time. Everything goes well until a storm ruins the family's boat, leaving them with nothing to keep the new business going. Following this disaster, the family experiences several awful events such as having to leave the house, the death of the grandfather, and 'Ntoni and his brothers being obliged to return to fish for the wholesalers.  The film can be divided by its prologue, three main phases and an epilogue. Its first part tells us about the fishermens' attempt to improve their economic circumstances. They demand a better price for their fish, and it is symbolized by 'Ntoni, the eldest son of Valastros family, throwing a pair of scales into the ocean, and the fishermen end up in prison. The wholesalers realize it is more profitable to have him and his friends fishing and release them. 'Ntoni, who has lived on the mainland, had brought some new open minded ideas with him and he tries to form a cooperative, but no one joins him. In deciding to do it on his own, he convinces his family to mortgage their house to buy a boat and starts his new life. A festive mood is present in this sequence, with all the village joining Valastro's family salting the fish in laughter and joy. The second part, is dedicated to show Valastro's vulnerability. They realize that the price for being owners is high; they not only have to buy the salt but also work hard and not stop even in the hardest storm, risking their lives to be able to feed so many mouths at home. When they go out in a particularly bad storm, their new boat is severely damaged, and the Valastros have no money to get it repaired. At this point in the film, we see the other fishermen and the wholesalers mocking them already, convinced of the immutability of the prevailing social order. The third phase of the film just affirms this already noticed vulnerability. The social and psychological consequences of the Valastros' attempt to change things are gradually revealed. They go out of work, no one wants to give them any opportunities, and the wholesalers are able to set the price for their fish. In the scene showing the wholesalers increasing the prices yet again, we can see the face of the children registering amazement at the cruelty of the adults. This was quite a common feature in neorealist films, and one almost sees this as an awakening of consciousness. The family unit, so strong in the beginning of the film, breaks down. Now they have no family, no house, the grandfather dies, 'Ntoni's brother Cola leaves for the mainland to seek new opportunities, their sister Lucia loses her reputation, yielding to the temptations of Marshal Don Salvatore, and 'Ntoni starts drinking. Only the elder sister Mara remains strong, although she loses all hope of ever getting married because of not being rich. In the epilogue, 'Ntoni finally overcomes his pride, recognizing the true cause of the problems of his kind and his class, and sees the need for collective action by going back with his two young brothers, Vanni and Alessio, to work for the wholesalers as a day laborer, who have bought new boats. The entire mood of the film becomes oppressive since the camera never leaves Aci Trezza, except in the scenes at sea at the beginning and end of the film. The outside world appears only indirectly when 'Ntoni goes to prison, when the family goes to sign a contract with the bank, when a stranger offering American cigarettes appears to tempt the youngsters to move to the mainland, and when the old baroness honors the inauguration of the new wholesaler's boats with her presence. Some allusions to modern Italian history are also there. On the wall of the restaurant we can see an image of a hammer and sickle. One of the wholesalers suddenly says: ""The country is full of communism!"", and his colleague answers: ""Raimondo is always right,"" in a parody of the Fascist slogan, ""Il Duce is always right."" At the end of the film, a faded text can be seen behind Raimondo: :Go with determination toward people. ~ Benito Mussolini."

'Ntoni, who has lived on the mainland, had brought some new open minded ideas with him and he tries to form a cooperative, but no one joins him. In deciding to do it on his own, he convinces his family to mortgage their house to buy a boat and starts his new life. A festive mood is present in this sequence, with all the village joining Valastro's family salting the fish in laughter and joy. The second part, is dedicated to show Valastro's vulnerability. They realize that the price for being owners is high; they not only have to buy the salt but also work hard and not stop even in the hardest storm, risking their lives to be able to feed so many mouths at home. When they go out in a particularly bad storm, their new boat is severely damaged, and the Valastros have no money to get it repaired. At this point in the film, we see the other fishermen and the wholesalers mocking them already, convinced of the immutability of the prevailing social order. The third phase of the film just affirms this already noticed vulnerability. The social and psychological consequences of the Valastros' attempt to change things are gradually revealed. They go out of work, no one wants to give them any opportunities, and the wholesalers are able to set the price for their fish. In the scene showing the wholesalers increasing the prices yet again, we can see the face of the children registering amazement at the cruelty of the adults. This was quite a common feature in neorealist films, and one almost sees this as an awakening of consciousness. The family unit, so strong in the beginning of the film, breaks down. Now they have no family, no house, the grandfather dies, 'Ntoni's brother Cola leaves for the mainland to seek new opportunities, their sister Lucia loses her reputation, yielding to the temptations of Marshal Don Salvatore, and 'Ntoni starts drinking. Only the elder sister Mara remains strong, although she loses all hope of ever getting married because of not being rich. In the epilogue, 'Ntoni finally overcomes his pride, recognizing the true cause of the problems of his kind and his class, and sees the need for collective action by going back with his two young brothers, Vanni and Alessio, to work for the wholesalers as a day laborer, who have bought new boats. The entire mood of the film becomes oppressive since the camera never leaves Aci Trezza, except in the scenes at sea at the beginning and end of the film. The outside world appears only indirectly when 'Ntoni goes to prison, when the family goes to sign a contract with the bank, when a stranger offering American cigarettes appears to tempt the youngsters to move to the mainland, and when the old baroness honors the inauguration of the new wholesaler's boats with her presence. Some allusions to modern Italian history are also there. On the wall of the restaurant we can see an image of a hammer and sickle. One of the wholesalers suddenly says: ""The country is full of communism!"", and his colleague answers: ""Raimondo is always right,"" in a parody of the Fascist slogan, ""Il Duce is always right."" At the end of the film, a faded text can be seen behind Raimondo: :Go with determination toward people. ~ Benito Mussolini."

The assailant kills Dionís, leads the blindfolded horse to a cliff's edge then pushes the wagon with Dionís and his son, Culet, off the cliff. Andreu, an 11-year-old boy, discovers the wreckage of the fallen cart. Culet is still alive but manages to say a single word before dying: Pitorliua, the name that villagers have given to a ghost believed to haunt a cave. The falangist mayor of the town suspects that Farriol, Andreu’s father, is involved in the deaths of Dionis and his son. Farriol, who was Dionís’s business partner dealing with birds, is an easy target for incrimination due to his suspicious background as a supporter of the Second Spanish Republic, which was repressed by the Francoist Spain. Years before, the mayor and Farriol were rivals vying for the love of Florència, Andreu’s mother, who ultimately chose Farriol as her husband, cementing the major resentment against both of them. Fearing for his life, Farriol decides to flee and cross the border into France. Florència has to work in a factory in Vic so Andreu is sent to live with his paternal relatives in a house full of women and children. Àvia, Andreu’s old grandmother and Ció, a widower aunt who has a son a few years older than Andreu, work looking after the country home of the richest family of the region, the Manuben. There is also a younger aunt, Enriqueta, who is being pressured into marrying an older neighbour she does not love. The grim household is completed by Andreu’s orphan cousin Núria, a maimed but beautiful girl around his age, who lost a hand while playing with a grenade. Soon Andreu begins to unearth his family’s dark secrets. His aunt, Enriqueta, is the talk of the village because she is carrying on a secret affair with a civil guard. The precocious and lively Núria is engaging in sexual games with her alcoholic school teacher. Andreu befriends an older boy who he first spots bathing naked in a river in the forest. The boy is a tuberculosis patient in a nearby monastery, who imagines he has angels' wings. Andreu helps him by setting aside some food for him. Farriol, as Andreu accidentally discovers, has not really left for France but is hiding in the farmhouse attic. Núria and Andreu become frequent companions roaming the mysterious forest together. She has a crush on him and tries a sex game, but he rejects her sexual advances. When the mayor orders a search of the farmhouse, Farriol is found and sent to prison. Farriol furtively tells Andreu to convince Florència to ask for help from the influential Mrs. Manubens. Florència pays her a visit. Because the rich lady is childless and has a weakness for children Florència takes Andreu with her. Mrs. Manubens reluctantly writes a letter to the mayor interceding on behalf of Farriol. However, the mayor tries to take sexual advantage of Florència instead. Andreu slowly discovers that his mother has a secret of her own. In her youth she was a close friend of Pitorliua, the ghost of the legend, who was actually a delicate young man. Visiting his burial place, Andreu and Núria encounter Pauletta, Dionís’s half-demented widow. Pauletta tells them that Pitorliua was the homosexual lover of the only brother of Mrs. Manubens and because of this he was castrated. She implies that Farriol had something to do with it. Exploring the cave where Pitorliua was castrated Andreu and Núria discover the names of the culprits on the wall: Dionís and Farriol. Andreu confronts his mother and Florència confesses that Dionís and Farriol were paid by Mrs. Manubens to scare Pitorliua off, but things went too far. Farriol is condemned to death. Before he is executed Florència and Andreu visit him in jail to say goodbye. He tells his son not to forget his ideals. After Farriol’s funeral Pauletta spitefully reveals to Florència and Andreu that Farriol was the killer of her husband and son following orders from Mrs. Manubens. Dionís tried to blackmail her and Mrs. Manubens first got rid of Dionís and then of Farriol. The rich lady bought Farriol’s silence in exchange for providing an excellent education for Andreu. Andreu begins to reject his family full of lies and deceptions. Instead of running away with Núria as they originally planned, he ultimately accepts to be educated at the expense of Mrs. Manubens. Florència comes to see him at the boarding school, but Andreu has not forgiven his parents. When a classmate asks him who was the woman who came to see him he just answers that it was a woman from his village.

30871765	/m/03fvn9	Sky King				{}	{}	{}	"Approximately six months after the events of the first movie, Rachel Keller  and her son Aidan  have moved from Seattle to the quiet coastal community of Astoria, Oregon. Rachel begins a new job at the Daily Astorian, a local newspaper, working for Max Rourke . Before long, there is news of a teenage homicide in town. Rachel investigates, finding the dead boy's face shows a deformed expression of horror just like the previous victims of Samara Morgan's cursed tape. Upon finding the boy's corpse, she also has a vision of Samara grabbing her and declaring ""I found you."" After that she goes to the police station in order to talk to the girl who witnessed the boy's death and after persuading the girl to tell her she finds out where the tape is. She takes the tape deep into the woods and burns it. Aidan has a dream in which he comes down to the T.V. room without Rachel home, and is pulled into the screen by Samara when the videotape starts. Back at home, Aidan starts to develop hypothermia, and his body is suddenly covered with bruises. At a county fair, Aidan takes pictures of himself in the bathroom mirror, with a blurred Samara standing behind him. His behavior grows increasingly odd and distant, and while driving back from the fair, the car carrying Aidan and Rachel is repeatedly attacked by a deer, nearly killing them. This event was apparently mysteriously foreseen by Aidan, who warned Rachel of impending danger seconds before the deer came out of nowhere. Strange occurrences within their house  frighten Rachel, leading her and Aidan to flee. Rachel subsequently asks Max if he can take care of the increasingly sick Aidan at his house. Max says that Aidan's condition merits a trip to the hospital, but Rachel, knowing that his illness is unnatural, is adamant that traditional doctors cannot help him. When Rachel attempts to give Aidan  a warm bath at Max's, a series of paranormal events leads to Rachel seeing Aidan's body replaced by Samara. Max walks in when she attempts to drown Samara, and sees her trying to drown Aidan instead. Suspicious, he insists on taking Aidan to the hospital against her wishes, stating, ""You wanted my help, now you're getting it."" Based on the bruises on Aidan's body, the hospital staff, particularly psychiatrist Dr. Emma Temple , suspect child abuse on Rachel's part, because Rachel reveals she suffered from postpartum depression, and won't allow her to be near her son. Desperate for answers, Rachel flees the hospital and returns to the Morgan Ranch  to dig deeper into Samara's past. Knowing that Samara was not Richard and Anna Morgan's biological child, she tracks down Samara's birth mother, Evelyn , who tried to drown Samara as an infant and has been living in a mental institution ever since. Meanwhile, Samara  inflicts a psychic assault on Dr. Temple, forcing Dr. Temple to commit suicide so that Samara  can escape the hospital. Evelyn advises Rachel to ""listen to your baby"" when she seeks advice on how to deal with Samara. Max goes to Rachel's house to check on her, only to find Aidan watching TV alone. He attempts to surreptitiously capture Aidan on film in order to reveal Samara, as Aidan had before Samara possessed him. Aidan/Samara notices the camera. When Rachel returns home, she finds Max's car parked outside and his dead body inside with the same warped expression of Samara's other victims. Disturbed and unsure of what to do, Rachel then goes inside to face her possessed son. Rachel tells Aidan/Samara that he should go to sleep. Aidan responds that he never sleeps. She suggests she make him something to eat. Rachel goes into the kitchen, preparing two peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. On one sandwich, she puts sleeping medication, intended to make Aidan unconscious. After eating the sandwich, Aidan soon falls asleep. Rachel fills the upstairs bathtub with water and holds an unconscious Aidan underwater. Aidan suddenly wakes up, telling Rachel that he is still Aidan. Rachel then drowns Aidan and Samara's spirit leaves his body, and Rachel is then able to revive him. However, Samara attempts to come back into the house through the TV set. Rachel grabs onto Samara as she is emerging, and is pulled into Samara's well inside the world of the cursed video. Looking up, Rachel realizes that the well lid is always left open. Rachel begins climbing the side of the well. Halfway up, Samara emerges from the water below and also ascends in a very inhuman fashion. As Rachel is climbing out of the well, Samara grabs her leg. Rachel manages to shake her off and then causes a jet of water to come out of the side of the well. Samara loses her grip and falls back down the well, however, she begins climbing again at a rapid rate. Rachel climbs out of the well just as Samara cries '""Mommy!""' in a deep voice. Rachel responds angrily that she's not her mother and pushes the lid shut just as Samara is about to escape, trapping her in the well. As Rachel wanders the monochromatic world of the cursed tape, she hears Aidan's voice and walks toward it, only to come to the cliff where Anna Morgan jumped to her death. She hears Aidan calling her name below. Determined to follow Aidan's voice, Rachel jumps off the cliff and ends up back in her living room with Aidan, where they embrace. Aidan calls Rachel '""Mommy""', and she asks him to just call her Rachel. The film ends when the camera then views the street and the sky, where a crescent moon can still be seen. The film then flickers out."

The style of the film is a legacy of Lowenstein's background in advertising and music video production; before Dogs in Space he had served as director for a series of promotional clips for songs from the INXS album The Swing. The script was developed from Lowenstein's own experiences and the central character Sam is based on Sam Sejavka from the band The Ears, with whom Lowenstein lived in the 1970s. Chuck Meo, who plays a drummer in the movie, also lived with the pair. The house, in Berry Street, was the same house Lowenstein and Sejavka shared and was rented from its new owners and modified at considerable expense for the film. Lowenstein wrote himself out of the film and several of his exploits were attributed to the character Tim . Sejavka has a brief cameo in a party scene as a character called Michael. In the film, Sam and Tim are the key members of a band called Dogs in Space and share their house with various social misfits including Sam's girlfriend Anna , a university student called Luchio  and a transient and apparently nameless teenager known only as The Girl , a character based extremely closely on Sara, who for a period lived with Lowenstein at Berry Street. The film's minimal plot traces the day-to-day existence of the characters, particularly the relationship between Sam and Anna, and is virtually an endless sequence of intense party scenes involving heavy substance-abuse. In between, there are trips to Ballarat  and humorous encounters with an aggressive neighbour  and one character's fast-talking, chainsaw-wielding uncle , who simply turns up one afternoon with his family . There is also a minor sub-plot in which the characters try unsuccessfully to pass off some rubbish burned in an oven as a piece of Skylab to a local radio station. In the end, the group's dysfunctional and hedonistic lifestyle claims a victim when Anna dies from a heroin overdose.

Yukie is later revealed to be Koyuki Kazahana, a princess from an island known as the Land of Snow. Doto Kazahana, who is revealed to be Koyuki's uncle, was responsible for the murder of her father Sosetsu in a coup d'etat. During the shooting of the film, Doto's henchmen, wearing Chakra armor, attempt to capture the princess, but Team 7 manages to delay the princess from being captured. Doto eventually captures Koyuki and kills her bodyguards, who reveal themselves in an attempt to protect and restore her rightful place as the ruler of the Land of Snow. Naruto enters the ship to rescue the princess, only to be captured and forced to wear a chakra-draining device. Doto forces Koyuki to hand over a crystal necklace her father had given her when she was young, thinking that this is a key that can unlock the hidden treasure Sosetsu had left behind before detaining both Koyuki and Naruto. Sakura, Sasuke and Kakashi infiltrate the fortress while Naruto and Koyuki escape from captivity. They confront Doto but he manages to capture the crystal necklace and flees with Koyuki. Naruto proceeds to follow Doto while the remaining members of Team 7 confront Doto's henchmen. Kakashi gets his revenge by defeating Doto's henchman Nadare Roga, while Sakura and Sasuke defeat the other two henchmen Fubuki Kakuyoku and Mizore Fuyukuma. Meanwhile, Doto discovers the hidden treasure to transform the island into the Land of Spring using a heat generator. Naruto confronts him in a duel, but gets overpowered while Sasuke uses his Chidori to weaken Doto's armour. Soon after, Naruto releases his energy and uses his new Seven Colored Chakra Rasengan, killing Doto and activating a mirror to transform the land. At the end of the film, Koyuki decides to reclaim her rightful place of royalty and even mentions personally with Team 7 that even in the life of royalty, her acting career will not end.

She is returning from a long trip to the West Bank. In Los Angeles, she works at a homeless mission and looks up her only living relative in the US, her late mother's brother, Paul . He is a paranoid Vietnam veteran who drives around filming and spying on Arabs and people with Arab features. Lana, in contrast, leans toward anti-war convictions and has been changed by her experiences abroad, so feels outside American culture. Having first-hand knowledge of the Middle East and Africa, she sees similarities between the slums of Los Angeles and those of the Third World. After she and Paul see the murder of a young Pakistani outside the mission, they take his body to his family. Their road trip offers Paul a different view of Arab home life. Over the course of the film, Paul and Lana learn more about each other.

According to a prophecy, the city would fall to a race of warlike, one-eyed monsters referred to as ""one-eyes"" should the balls be removed, and could only be saved by ""the simplest soul with the smallest and simplest of things"". Living in the city are a humble and good-hearted cobbler named Tack and a nameless, unsuccessful yet persistent thief. Both characters are mute and have no dialogue. When the thief tries his luck in Tack's house, the two scuffle and stumble onto the street, causing Tack's tacks to fall out onto the street while Zigzag, King Nod's Grand Vizier, walks through it. Zigzag steps on one of the tacks and orders Tack to be arrested while the thief escapes. Tack is brought before King Nod and his daughter, Princess Yum-Yum, who takes an instant liking to Tack. Before Zigzag can convince Nod to have Tack executed, Yum-Yum saves Tack by breaking one of her shoes and ordering Tack to fix it. While repairing her shoe, Tack and Yum-Yum become increasingly attracted to each other, much to the jealousy of Zigzag, who lusts after Yum-Yum and plots to take over the kingdom by marrying her. Meanwhile, the thief notices the golden balls atop the minaret and decides to steal them. After breaking into the palace through a gutter, the thief steals the repaired shoe from Tack, leading the cobbler to chase him through the palace. Upon retrieving the shoe, Tack bumps into Zigzag, who notices the shoe is fixed and takes the opportunity to lock Tack in a dungeon.  The next morning, Nod has a vision of the Golden City's doom at the hands of the one-eyes. While Zigzag tries to convince Nod of the kingdom's security under the protection of the golden balls, the thief manages to steal the balls after several failed attempts, only to lose them to Zigzag's minions. Tack escapes from his cell using his cobbling tools during the ensuing panic. Nod notices the balls' disappearance after being warned of the one-eyes by a dying soldier who was mortally wounded during an attack against them. Zigzag attempts to use the stolen balls to blackmail the king into letting him marry Yum-Yum. When Nod refuses, Zigzag defects to the one-eyes and gives them the balls instead. Nod sends Yum-Yum, her nanny, and Tack on a journey to ask for help from a ""mad, holy old witch"" who lives in the desert. They are secretly followed by the thief, who hears of treasures on the journey but has no success stealing any. They also meet a band of dimwitted brigands led by Chief Ruthless in the desert whom Yum-Yum declares as her royal guard. The protagonists reach the hand-shaped tower where the witch lives, and learn from the witch that Tack is the one prophesied to save the Golden City. The witch also presents a riddle: ""Attack, attack, attack! A tack, see? But it's what you do with what you've got!"" The protagonists return to the Golden City to find the one-eyes' massive war machine approaching. Remembering the witch's riddle, Tack shoots a single tack into the enemy's midst, sparking a Goldberg-esque chain reaction that causes the war machine to slowly collapse and destroy the entire one-eye army. Zigzag tries to escape, but falls into a pit where he is eaten alive by alligators and his mistreated pet vulture Phido. The thief, avoiding many deathtraps, steals the golden balls from the collapsing machine, only to have them taken away from him by Tack, after which the thief gives up and lets Tack have them. With peace restored and the prophecy fulfilled, the city celebrates as Tack and Yum-Yum marry; before they kiss, Tack speaks for the first and only time in the film, saying ""I love you"" to Yum-Yum in a deep voice. The film ends with the thief stealing the entire reel of film and running away.  The version by Fred Calvert is considerably different from Williams' workprint. Four songs have been added – the film originally had none. Many scenes have been cut: These include the thief attempting to steal various objects along with evading capital punishment for it, and the subplot where Zigzag tries to feed Tack to Phido. Also removed are any references to the ""bountiful maiden from Mombassa"", whom Zigzag gives to King Nod as ""a plaything"" in the workprint. Tack, who was  mute in the original, speaks many times in the film and narrates most scenes in past tense as an older Tack: The original had narration only in the beginning by a voice over. Some subplots have been added; In one, Yum-Yum is tired of doing nothing and wants to help her father: She volunteers to be sent to the perilous journey in order to prove herself to be more than ""just a pretty face"". Another subplot is that there is a social class romance between Tack and Yum-Yum that is similar to Disney's Aladdin: The Nanny scolds Yum Yum for liking a lowly cobbler so much, and is very negative towards Tack. In the original, her behaviour is very different and much more positive. Also, there are several lines of alternate or removed dialogue. Additionally, the following scene-specific changes have been made: * In the scene where Yum-Yum is introduced, she tells Nanny that she is tired of living a life of ""regal splendor"" and sings the first added song of the film, ""She is More"". * The scene where Zigzag's plans are revealed to the audience has been moved to an earlier point of the film . * After Zigzag puts Tack in his cell, Tack and Yum-Yum sing the second song, ""Am I Feeling Love?"". * The one-eyes are revealed at the very beginning during the opening narration. The scene where the One-Eyes would have been first introduced in Williams' version has been changed to a nightmare for King Nod, who then calls Zigzag immediately. The king had a nightmare in the original, too, but more abstract and later in the film. * The reason for the King refusing to let Zigzag marry Yum-Yum is that he finds it ridiculous that his minister, who is a practitioner of the black arts, should wed a princess, who is only allowed to marry someone pure of heart. * The brigands are a troupe of loafers who were sent twenty years ago by the King to guard his borders. Because none of them are literate, they do not know when to return and have become bandits. They sing the song, ""Bom Bom Bom Beem Bom"" to describe their situation. Oddly, they seem to understand the text in their ""Brigand's Book"" very clearly. * The Witch first appears as a floating eye, instead of being initially inside a tiny urn. * The Witch's riddle is: ""When to the wall you find your back; a tack, a tack, a tack!"" * The way the slave women kill the Mighty One-eye is changed: In the original, they chant ""throne"" and sit on him . In this version, they throw him off the cliff. * During the collapse of the war machine, Tack and Zigzag have a hand-to-hand fight. The fight ends with Tack sewing Zigzag's robe, disabling him. * When One-Eye's army has been broken, the thief emerges and  willingly hands the Golden Balls to the King. When Tack and the Princess marry, there are flashbacks of all their times together up to that point, while the song ""It's So Amazing"" plays. Tack mentions that the thief gave him his word that he would never steal again, with the thief then shown breaking his promise by stealing the ""The End"" sign and the entire film. * Because Tack now has a voice throughout the film, the gag where he has a deep voice has been removed.  The Miramax version includes all changes made in The Princess and the Cobbler, and adds the following: * Several previously mute characters were given voices, most notably the thief . Other characters that have added voices are Phido and the alligators. * The Golden City is called Baghdad. * The Witch is the benevolent twin sister of the evil One-Eye. * The scenes with the witch in her human form are removed in this version of the film, leaving only a floating eye and a ghostlike image. * The Witch's riddle is extended to: ""When to the wall you find your back; a tack, a tack, a tack! Belief in yourselves is what you lack! A tack, a tack, and never look back!"" * Most scenes featuring the One-eye's slave women have been removed, although he can still be seen sitting on them. * The scene where the Mighty One-eye dies has been removed, and he appears to be alive when his machine is shown burning . Whether or not he dies afterward is unknown, although it is implied by Tack that he did – Tack says that ""One-eye and his army were defeated for all eternity."" * The ending has been entirely recut. At the end, Tack becomes Prince and the first Arabian Knight. The song ""It's So Amazing"" has been removed. During the wedding, the thief attempts to steal the balls again. Tack ends the story by saying: ""So next time you see a shooting star, be proud of who you really are. Do in your heart what you know is right, and you too shall become an Arabian Knight."" Tack also mentions that the thief eventually was put in jail for years but becomes the Captain of the Guards and the king even allows him to steal one last thing which explains why he took the end sign as well as the entire film. * The end credits for the Miramax version featured the songs It's So Amazing, the short version of Bom, Bom, Bom, Beem, Bom, and the Arnold McCuller/Andrea Robinson version of the song Am I Feeling Love?, but the end credits for the Majestic Films version only featured the songs Bom, Bom, Bom, Beem, Bom  and the Arnold McCuller/Andrea Robinson version of the song Am I Feeling Love?.  The popular unofficial fan restoration by Garrett Gilchrist mostly follows Richard Williams' workprint very closely, at least in its intent, using most of its original audio track and editing structure. In order to present a more complete film, Gilchrist added additional music  and sound effects, and also included finished footage that does not appear in a finished state in the workprint, whether taken from Calvert's versions or from other rare sources. Most of the story changes made by Fred Calvert and Miramax are not present, but it does include a few minor Calvert-only scenes or alterations, either as a side effect of using Calvert's footage for a major video source or because Gilchrist felt these scenes were useful to the storyline. For this reason, Gilchrist does not refer to his edit as a ""Director's Cut.""<ref nameThieves, Cobblers, and Fan Edits: The 50-Year Odyssey of an Animated Masterpiece | urlTested | date29 September 2012}}  * Nanny becomes impatient with Yumyum and Tack's burgeoning romance and pushes her away so she can have her bath.  * The Thief's arrest for stealing an emerald has a longer ending.  * King Nod's line to his daughter, voiced by Clive Revill : ""My princess... I hardly know you... so brave. Just like your dear mother was! [chuckle] Very well. You will go. Look here!""  * The Mad and Holy Old Witch appears first as an eye, coming out of a lamp.  * The Old Witch says ""Mystic fumes, show me the way ...""  * Zigzag tries to convince One Eye to spare the Princess. ""She is the price for my traitorous deed.""  * Toward the end of the film, Zigzag tries to kidnap Yumyum on his horse. Tack fights back, punches Zigzag and stitches his cloak together. Tack and Yumyum hug. Zigzag hops away, falling into a pit for his death scene.  * The royal guards praise The Thief for returning the three golden balls, and lift him up.  * The credits roll over deleted-scene footage, including a section of the credits from The Princess and the Cobbler, showing The Thief on springs trying to steal the Buddha Ruby. * Gilchrist has said that the ""Mark IV"" version of The Recobbled Cut, coming 2013, will have longer scenes with the Brigands, taken from deleted scene audio."

Another subplot is that there is a social class romance between Tack and Yum-Yum that is similar to Disney's Aladdin: The Nanny scolds Yum Yum for liking a lowly cobbler so much, and is very negative towards Tack. In the original, her behaviour is very different and much more positive. Also, there are several lines of alternate or removed dialogue. Additionally, the following scene-specific changes have been made: * In the scene where Yum-Yum is introduced, she tells Nanny that she is tired of living a life of ""regal splendor"" and sings the first added song of the film, ""She is More"". * The scene where Zigzag's plans are revealed to the audience has been moved to an earlier point of the film . * After Zigzag puts Tack in his cell, Tack and Yum-Yum sing the second song, ""Am I Feeling Love?"". * The one-eyes are revealed at the very beginning during the opening narration. The scene where the One-Eyes would have been first introduced in Williams' version has been changed to a nightmare for King Nod, who then calls Zigzag immediately. The king had a nightmare in the original, too, but more abstract and later in the film. * The reason for the King refusing to let Zigzag marry Yum-Yum is that he finds it ridiculous that his minister, who is a practitioner of the black arts, should wed a princess, who is only allowed to marry someone pure of heart. * The brigands are a troupe of loafers who were sent twenty years ago by the King to guard his borders. Because none of them are literate, they do not know when to return and have become bandits. They sing the song, ""Bom Bom Bom Beem Bom"" to describe their situation. Oddly, they seem to understand the text in their ""Brigand's Book"" very clearly. * The Witch first appears as a floating eye, instead of being initially inside a tiny urn. * The Witch's riddle is: ""When to the wall you find your back; a tack, a tack, a tack!"" * The way the slave women kill the Mighty One-eye is changed: In the original, they chant ""throne"" and sit on him . In this version, they throw him off the cliff. * During the collapse of the war machine, Tack and Zigzag have a hand-to-hand fight. The fight ends with Tack sewing Zigzag's robe, disabling him. * When One-Eye's army has been broken, the thief emerges and  willingly hands the Golden Balls to the King. When Tack and the Princess marry, there are flashbacks of all their times together up to that point, while the song ""It's So Amazing"" plays. Tack mentions that the thief gave him his word that he would never steal again, with the thief then shown breaking his promise by stealing the ""The End"" sign and the entire film. * Because Tack now has a voice throughout the film, the gag where he has a deep voice has been removed.  The Miramax version includes all changes made in The Princess and the Cobbler, and adds the following: * Several previously mute characters were given voices, most notably the thief . Other characters that have added voices are Phido and the alligators. * The Golden City is called Baghdad. * The Witch is the benevolent twin sister of the evil One-Eye. * The scenes with the witch in her human form are removed in this version of the film, leaving only a floating eye and a ghostlike image. * The Witch's riddle is extended to: ""When to the wall you find your back; a tack, a tack, a tack! Belief in yourselves is what you lack! A tack, a tack, and never look back!"" * Most scenes featuring the One-eye's slave women have been removed, although he can still be seen sitting on them. * The scene where the Mighty One-eye dies has been removed, and he appears to be alive when his machine is shown burning . Whether or not he dies afterward is unknown, although it is implied by Tack that he did – Tack says that ""One-eye and his army were defeated for all eternity."" * The ending has been entirely recut. At the end, Tack becomes Prince and the first Arabian Knight. The song ""It's So Amazing"" has been removed. During the wedding, the thief attempts to steal the balls again. Tack ends the story by saying: ""So next time you see a shooting star, be proud of who you really are. Do in your heart what you know is right, and you too shall become an Arabian Knight."" Tack also mentions that the thief eventually was put in jail for years but becomes the Captain of the Guards and the king even allows him to steal one last thing which explains why he took the end sign as well as the entire film. * The end credits for the Miramax version featured the songs It's So Amazing, the short version of Bom, Bom, Bom, Beem, Bom, and the Arnold McCuller/Andrea Robinson version of the song Am I Feeling Love?, but the end credits for the Majestic Films version only featured the songs Bom, Bom, Bom, Beem, Bom  and the Arnold McCuller/Andrea Robinson version of the song Am I Feeling Love?.  The popular unofficial fan restoration by Garrett Gilchrist mostly follows Richard Williams' workprint very closely, at least in its intent, using most of its original audio track and editing structure. In order to present a more complete film, Gilchrist added additional music  and sound effects, and also included finished footage that does not appear in a finished state in the workprint, whether taken from Calvert's versions or from other rare sources. Most of the story changes made by Fred Calvert and Miramax are not present, but it does include a few minor Calvert-only scenes or alterations, either as a side effect of using Calvert's footage for a major video source or because Gilchrist felt these scenes were useful to the storyline. For this reason, Gilchrist does not refer to his edit as a ""Director's Cut.""<ref nameThieves, Cobblers, and Fan Edits: The 50-Year Odyssey of an Animated Masterpiece | urlTested | date29 September 2012}}  * Nanny becomes impatient with Yumyum and Tack's burgeoning romance and pushes her away so she can have her bath.  * The Thief's arrest for stealing an emerald has a longer ending.  * King Nod's line to his daughter, voiced by Clive Revill : ""My princess... I hardly know you... so brave. Just like your dear mother was! [chuckle] Very well. You will go. Look here!""  * The Mad and Holy Old Witch appears first as an eye, coming out of a lamp.  * The Old Witch says ""Mystic fumes, show me the way ...""  * Zigzag tries to convince One Eye to spare the Princess. ""She is the price for my traitorous deed.""  * Toward the end of the film, Zigzag tries to kidnap Yumyum on his horse. Tack fights back, punches Zigzag and stitches his cloak together. Tack and Yumyum hug. Zigzag hops away, falling into a pit for his death scene.  * The royal guards praise The Thief for returning the three golden balls, and lift him up.  * The credits roll over deleted-scene footage, including a section of the credits from The Princess and the Cobbler, showing The Thief on springs trying to steal the Buddha Ruby. * Gilchrist has said that the ""Mark IV"" version of The Recobbled Cut, coming 2013, will have longer scenes with the Brigands, taken from deleted scene audio."

The 10-year old Hitler  is shown to be arrogant and disobedient. He has a stern, ill-tempered father, Alois Hitler ([[Ian Hogg , and a doting mother, Klara Hitler , who indulges his dreams of becoming a great artist. One day, his father dies of a heart attack but the young Hitler shows no empathy or concern. Several years later, a 17-year old Hitler  applies unsuccessfully to the Vienna Arts Academy but is told he lacks the talent to become an artist. Following his mother’s death, he moves to Vienna permanently but is unable to find work and soon becomes destitute and homeless. Influenced by the city’s prevalent anti-semitism, young Hitler becomes convinced that the Jews and immigrants are to blame for his misfortunes. In 1914, the now adult Hitler  leaves Austria for Munich and joins the Germany army to fight in the First World War. After surviving a major battle, he is promoted to the rank of Corporal but his intense fanaticism and virulent anti-semitic and anti-Marxist rhetoric make him unpopular with the other soldiers, who routinely ridicule and ostracise him. After Hitler displays bravery during one particular battle, he emotionally blackmails his Jewish commanding officer into awarding him an Iron Cross, claiming to be the only soldier in the regiment to defend him against anti-semitism. During the last days of the war, when Germany is in retreat, Hitler is blinded by a gas attack and is recovering in a hospital when, he learns that the German Army has surrendered in the war. Hearing the news, he suffers an emotional breakdown, regains his eyesight and vows to dedicate his life toward reversing the outcome of the war. Hitler returns to Munich in 1919 to find it in the midst of political revolution. Still employed by the army, he is assigned to report on the activities of the newly formed political parties in the city. After attending a meeting of the German Worker’s party, he is recruited by the party’s leader, Anton Drexler , to give speeches and organise its propaganda activities. Hitler’s speeches repeat the same themes: that Germany has been betrayed by the leaders who surrendered in the last war as well as the Communists, Jews and immigrants who are destroying the country from within. Gradually, his popularity as a fiery orator significantly expands the party’s membership and attracts the attention of wealthy entrepreneur, Ernst Hanfstaengl , who encourages Hitler to refine his image and create a symbol for the party - which Hitler does, by cropping his facial hair into his trademark toothbrush moustache, and making the Swastika the party's official emblem, respectively. Hansftaengl also puts Hitler in contact with the city’s elites; among them, decorated war hero, Herman Goering ; who help the party raise funds, allowing Hitler to buy his own newspaper and hire the SA , led by the militant Captain Röhm , to act as his personal security and also promote the party in the streets through agitation and violence against political opponents and Jews. The party’s new direction toward the elites and away from its working class roots upsets Drexler, who wants the party to merge with another right wing group, a decision Hitler strongly opposes. Following a tense confrontation, Hitler threatens to resign the party unless Drexler agrees to step down as leader. Drexler acquiesces, and in 1921, Hitler becomes Fuhrer of the newly named National Socialist Party. In 1923, Germany’s economic situation has worsened and the Bavarian Commissar, Gustav von Kahr , bans Hitler from holding rallies, as he believes the party’s agitation is causing further unrest around the countryside. Hansfaengl introduces Hitler to Fritz Gerlich , a renowned journalist and Von Kahr’s speechwriter. Hitler hopes he can persuade Gerlich to convince Kahr to accept him as an ally in his government. Gerlich, however, concludes from the conversation that Hitler is an unstable psychopath with a dangerous ideology and warns Kahr that he must be stopped. Kahr tries to outfox Hitler by convincing him that he is preparing to stage a military coup against the national government in Berlin and that Hitler must remain silent or else he can play no part in it. Upon learning that the proposed putsch is merely a ruse and that Kahr has no intention of working with him, Hitler confronts Kahr at gunpoint and coerces him and his associates into supporting his own plan for a putsch. To convince them to side with him, he gains the tacit approval of esteemed military general, Erich von Ludendorrff . Röhm and the SA plan to take over the military barracks in preparation for a march on Berlin. However, when Ludendorff releases Von Kahr and his associates, they alert the Bavarian Army of Hitler’s plan and the attempted coup is quickly crushed. Hitler takes refuge at the Hanfstaengl’s home, almost resorting to suicide before Ernst’s wife, Helene Hanfstaengl , stops him. Hitler is promptly arrested by the authorities and put on trial for attempted treason. Much to Gerlich’s horror, who is watching in the stands, Hitler manages to use the trial to his advantage, winning over the audience and the Judge with his courtroom theatrics and compelling speeches, in which he accuses Kahr and the national government, of being the real traitors. Consequently, the Judge awards him a lenient sentence of nine months imprisonment, during which Hitler writes his memoirs , assisted by his secretary, Rudolph Hess . After his release from prison, Hitler visits the Hansftaegls. Ernst has fallen out of favour with Hitler for abandoning the putsch in order to escape jail time and for refusing to publish Hitler’s memoirs. Their relationship is further fractured when Ernst becomes jealous of Hitler’s affections toward Helene, whom Hitler credits for saving his life by talking him out of suicide after the failed putsch. In 1925, Hitler goes to the countryside to escape politics. His older step-sister, Angela , and her daughter, Geli Raubal , come to live with him. Hitler quickly becomes infatuated and protective toward the attractive Geli, and he takes her with him when he returns to Munich to re-unify the party, which has disintegrated into warring factions since his incarceration. Blaming the putsch’s failure on Ludendorff’s incompetence, Hitler declares that the party can no longer rely on military means to achieve power but rather by following a legal, democratic course. He tells the party their task is to win elections, not cause agitation. This declaration puts him into conflict with Röhm, who continues to believe the party’s route to power is through an SA-led coup. Röhm’s refusal to bow to Hitler’s directive strains their relationship. Nonetheless, Hitler’s demand for complete subordination of the party wins the approval of the remaining party leaders, including an impressionable young agitator named Joseph Goebbels . During the late 1920s, as Germany’s economic situation once again worsens, the party’s political fortunes improve, with the National Socialists gaining more and more seats in the Reichstag with each election. Alarmed by the party’s growing popularity, Gerlich proceeds to write articles in opposition to Hitler, inflaming both Hitler and the SA, who attempt to suppress the newspaper through violence and intimidation. The paper’s editor bows to the pressure and fires Gerlich. Gerlich, however, soon forms his own newspaper by covertly using the same publishing house which produces Hitler’s newspapers, knowing that it is the one publishing company Hitler cannot afford to close down. Meanwhile, Geli, who has become distraught by Hitler’s emotionally abusive behaviour and overbearing control over her life, commits suicide with his pistol. Following her death, Hitler becomes acquainted with Eva Braun , who soon becomes his live-in lover until she too begins experiencing the same feeling of imprisonment that Geli felt. Eva eventually attempts suicide, but after the attempt fails, Hitler tells her never to do so again as it will interfere with his political ambitions. In 1932, Hitler becomes a German citizen in order so that he may run for President against incumbent, Paul von Hindenburg . Although he is unsuccessful, the party has become the largest party in the Reichstag, a fact which emboldens Hitler to demand Hindenburg appoint him Chancellor . Hindenburg, who despises Hitler, instead appoints Franz von Papen and Kurt von Schleicher to the Chancellorship, respectively, but both men fail in their positions as the National Socialists continually use their majority to dissolve each parliamentary session. Left with no other choice, Hindenburg appoints Hitler German Chancellor in 1933. Hitler tells Goering and Goebbels that they must do something drastic to consolidate their hold on power. Thereafter, the Reichstag is mysteriously set on fire, allegedly by a communist, and Hitler uses the incident to persuade the parliament to award him dictatorial powers, which include suspension of civil liberties and suppression of the press. As a consequence, Gerlich's newspaper is shut down and he is arrested by the SA. Despite Germany becoming a police state under his command, Hitler still feels insecure in his position and believes he must crush all his opponents once and for all. On June 30, 1934 , Röhm is arrested for refusing to accept that the SA must be absolved into the German Army rather than remain a separate para-military force. Given the choice by Hitler to commit suicide, Röhm refuses and is shot dead. Gerlich, who has been imprisoned at the Dachau concentration camp, is brutally beaten and murdered, and his wife sent a pair of his bloodied spectacles with no official notice of her husband’s death. Von Kahr, Schelicher and Hitler’s other political enemies are all swiftly ambushed and murdered. Hanfstaengl, who has all but completely fallen out out favour with Hitler, and whose marriage to Helene has become estranged after she has grown closer to Hitler, makes plans to flee Germany and the new regime. Following Hindenburg’s death in August, 1934, Hitler combines the office of President and Chancellor into one – at last making him the absolute ruler of Germany.

He demands the release of his drug kingpin father, Enrique Cali, only to be told that his father has already been delivered to the United States for trial. They escape by helicopter and with the weapons and logistics assistance of Luis' second-in-command, an American named Jack Thorpe, they enter the U.S. through Mexico. In the United States, the Regis High School is a prep school for teenage boys with wealthy and influential parents, half of whom have been expelled from other schools. A group of pranksters consisting of students Billy Tepper, Joey Trotta, Hank Giles, Ricardo Montoya, Jonathan Bradberry and Phil Donoghue are watched over by their teachers, especially stern but well-meaning Dean Parker. Phil's father is the Federal Judge presiding over Enrique Cali's trial, so he is taken to a safe location as a precaution. Unaware of this, Luis Cali invades the school to capture him, callously killing those who get in the way. Furthermore they rig the campus with heavy firearms and remote-detonated explosives. With Phil nowhere to be found and the sons of numerous influential individuals in his grasp, Luis takes the entire school hostage. Underestimating the threat, the local Sheriff attempts to intervene but is repelled by bazooka fire. The FBI and US Army are called in, keeping their distance to avoid provoking the terrorists. Luis releases the school faculty  but institutes hourly headcounts to keep track of the boys. The students, under Billy's leadership, use their expertise in skirting authority to collect tactical information about the occupying forces, which Billy covertly brings to the authorities on the outside. They won't allow Billy to return, but with Parker's encouragement, he escapes and narrowly rejoins the students in time to be counted, preventing the killing of Gould and four students in response. Joey's father, New York mafia boss Albert Trotta arranges through Luis' father for the boy to be released. Joey, contemptuous of his father, refuses to go. He steals a weapon and opens fire on another terrorist, but is killed. Luis tries to impress upon Parker, who comes to retrieve the body, that it was an accident, but Albert takes revenge by having Enrique Cali killed in prison. Knowing they must act before Luis can learn of his father's death, the authorities undertake a rescue mission. Special Forces  covertly infiltrate the school and begin taking out terrorists. Meanwhile, Billy and his friends sabotage the detonator for the explosives, incapacitate several more terrorists with surprise attacks and lead the students and Gould to a secret basement chamber. Overwhelmed by the assault, Luis takes Billy at gunpoint and holds him in Gould's office, where Parker and commandos converge and kill him, the dean being wounded in the process. The remaining terrorists are subdued and the students are liberated.

After escaping when the booth is knocked over, Terry is injected with truth serum by the computer tech, this time posing as a police officer, but escapes after trapping his arm in a car window and rolling the car into traffic. In a drug-induced haze, Terry again contacts Sarah and makes an impassioned plea for her help. Sarah tells Terry she would rather let Jack be killed than risk losing face. A disgusted Terry chastises Sarah for her indifference to Jack's plight and walks out. She then stumbles into work and after embarrassing Mr. Page by yanking off his fake hairpiece in front of the entire office, passes out. Terry awakens at home and is dropped in on by Sarah who has had a change of heart and gives her a contact. After passing the contact to Jack, she is again captured by the KGB and learns that Talbot is a KGB mole and the contact he provided  is a setup to kill Jack. After nearly being tortured with a power sander, Terry escapes and is caught by police. After realizing the police are arresting her rather than protecting her, Terry escapes. She rushes to the bank to warn Jack, but is again ambushed by the KGB and Talbot. After struggling with the KGB and biting Talbot's groin, she confirms to Jack that the contact will kill him. A gun-wielding Marty kills the last of Talbot's henchmen, identifies himself as Peter Caen, and gives Jack the correct contact.

Going through one of Jack's romantic contacts, Lady Sarah Billings , Terry is rebuffed and then captured by the KGB, who lock her in a phone booth and drag her around the city. After escaping when the booth is knocked over, Terry is injected with truth serum by the computer tech, this time posing as a police officer, but escapes after trapping his arm in a car window and rolling the car into traffic. In a drug-induced haze, Terry again contacts Sarah and makes an impassioned plea for her help. Sarah tells Terry she would rather let Jack be killed than risk losing face. A disgusted Terry chastises Sarah for her indifference to Jack's plight and walks out. She then stumbles into work and after embarrassing Mr. Page by yanking off his fake hairpiece in front of the entire office, passes out. Terry awakens at home and is dropped in on by Sarah who has had a change of heart and gives her a contact. After passing the contact to Jack, she is again captured by the KGB and learns that Talbot is a KGB mole and the contact he provided  is a setup to kill Jack. After nearly being tortured with a power sander, Terry escapes and is caught by police. After realizing the police are arresting her rather than protecting her, Terry escapes. She rushes to the bank to warn Jack, but is again ambushed by the KGB and Talbot. After struggling with the KGB and biting Talbot's groin, she confirms to Jack that the contact will kill him. A gun-wielding Marty kills the last of Talbot's henchmen, identifies himself as Peter Caen, and gives Jack the correct contact. After initially not showing up at a restaurant where he and Terry plan to meet, Jack  appears in her office to thank her personally by taking her out to dinner."

Natraj falls for her and eventually expresses his wish to marry her. She doubted that he will marry her at first because of the fact that she lost one leg in an accident. But Natraj still wanted to marry her and they eventually tie the knot. However, Natraj's aunt Rajamma  and her son, his cousin Balu do not like Sivakami and often look down on her because of her deficiency, and their hatred for her increases even more when Natraj entrusts the key of the money safe to her.

When Sivakami gets pregnant, Balu, along with his mother try and abort the baby fearing that Sivakami may control them of money once the baby is born by secretly spiking her drinks with a special drug which will abort the baby, and they succeed twice. But Natraj and Sivakami did not know of their plot and thought that the abortion naturally happened. Disheartened, they accept it as fate. One day when they were going out. Sivakami notices a temple tower in a distance. After some inquiry, they find out that it is an old temple, known as ""Kolakara Kaliamman Kovil"" meaning temple of killer Goddess, named so because of many mysterious murders that has been happening in that temple for the past ten years. One of the murders were shown in the beginning of the movie, where a married couple takes shelter in the temple during rain and the husband is lying dead under the trident of the Goddess the next morning, and the wife dies along with husband while mourning for him. Many other murders happened similarly. Nobody went to the temple after that. Sivakami wanted to go to the temple, and they enter the temple, which was very dilapidated.

One day Rajamma makes Sivakami grind rice to make a ""Maavilakku"" , despite knowing that she is handicapped, and goes to the temple with the flour for the vilakku without Sivakami, also knowing that Sivakami goes to the temple every Friday. Unhappy that she was not able to see the maavilakku ceremony, she prays to the Mother Goddess to forgive her. The Goddess  appears in front of her house in the guise of a lady, gives her some flour as blessing and leaves the house. After that, things start happening to the advantage of Sivakami through the grace of the Goddess. She gets pregnant again and this time Rajamma and Balu's efforts were in vain to abort the baby. Eventually Sivakami gives birth to a beautiful baby girl. Since young, the girl, named Devi, has behaved in many ways like the Mother Goddess.

At the house, Pierce asks who the father is and the woman says that he could be the father if he wants. Angered by the comment, Pierce leaves the house and continues his way to Soldier’s place. At the house, Soldier’s mother Mrs. Richardson asks Pierce if Soldier would ever act his age and wants Pierce to keep him out of trouble. Pierce promises her by saying that Soldier wrote him a letter that said he would never go back to jail and even asked for a job. Mrs. Richardson asks about his brother’s wedding and Pierce tells her about how he doesn’t like her because she’s rich. Pierce leaves saying that he has to go work at his mother’s shop. At the shop, Mr. Bitterfield comes in asking if Pierce’s mother, Mrs. Mundy, can mend the rip in his church going pants. When Pierce goes in the back to consult his mother, she says to tell Mr. Bitterfield that they can fix it but to instead throw them in the trash and give Mr. Bitterfield a pair from the unclaimed box.

Turning around to see Pierce and his father still wrestling, the man leaves as does Pierce’s parents. Back at home, Pierce’s mother informs him that his brother, Wendell, and his fiancée, Sonia, are coming over. Pierce says he does not want to go, complaining that Sonia is always bragging about how her family is rich and privileged. She warns Pierce that he has to behave so Sonia can see that he is civilized. She then tells him to go over to the neighborhood elders, Big Momma and Big Daddy, to see if they need anything and to pick up a pot. Once there, Big Daddy gets mad at Pierce for being rude and not saying anything. Pierce explains that he has to get back to the house before Wendell gets there. Pierce and Sonia get into an argument because Pierce thinks that Sonia had nothing to worry about all her life because she attended charm school. Sonia retaliates saying that she had to worry about things such as grades and if people liked her and her. Sonia also says that charm school taught young girls how to be ladies. They walk into the living room, where Wendell was telling his secretary of the wedding count. Upon hearing that, Pierce’s mother then turns and asks Pierce when he’s going to have a secretary. She says that she put them in church so that when they settled down she would have done her job. Intending that Pierce has not yet accomplished anything, Pierce tells his mother that it is not his fault. This upsets his mother as she tells him that it is his fault because of all the sacrifices that she and their father have given up for them. The next day, a man comes in looking for the clothes that he had brought in two months ago. They have trouble finding it because they man does not remember what he put his name as.

With Soldier close to returning home, Pierce goes to a liquor store and asks his friend if he would be willing to give Soldier a job. The friend says that he would give Pierce a job, but he will not give one to Soldier. Having been rejected, Pierce then goes to ask his friend, Bob, telling him that Soldier is getting out of jail. Bob states that it is too bad because a person like Soldier should just stay in jail until he rots. Hearing this, Pierce leaves without even asking and picks up Soldier to take him home. When Mrs. Richardson sees Soldier she starts crying and Pierce consoles her saying that he is here to stay. Pierce hangs out with Soldier saying that Soldier is with a different girl every time he seems him. They goof around and hang out for the day.

Someone hiding in the bushes then leaps out and tries to shoot them but there are no bullets in the gun. They end up chasing the man, but Pierce lets him go. Pierce’s mother begs him not to embarrass the family during dinner with the Richardson’s. She says that she didn’t raise heathens, but Pierce still states that he does not like Sonia because she has never worked for anything in her life. During dinner, Mr. Richardson asks Pierce what his job is. Pierce says that he went to school but did not like that everyone was doing the same thing. He tells him how he used to drive heavy machinery and delivered explosives. He states that he likes to work with his hands and that he’s not smart enough to become a lawyer. Pierce’s mother then says that it would have been nice to have a doctor and a lawyer in the family, but Pierce remarks that they are all crooks. Mr. Richardson says that the real corruption is in politics. Pierce states that the higher up you go, the lower the people you find. When Pierce’s mother asks Sonia about her trial, Pierce yells at her saying that letting her client go free was wrong because he had killed people. This ends the dinner and they leave with Pierce’s mother saying how ashamed of him she is.

Pierce’s mother goes to church but has to come back because she forgot her prayer book. She ends up walking in on them having sex and freaks out because they also did it on her prayer book. The girl then runs away in embarrassment. The next day, Soldier is waiting in a car for Pierce with another girl and sends Angela to go tell Pierce to hurry up. Angela ends up not telling Pierce that they are waiting and they leave without him.

He rushes home to ask his brother and Sonia to change they date, but they refuse because he had never been nice to Sonia. Pierce’s father then talks to him and tells them that maybe they can change the date of the funeral. With new hope, Pierce goes back to Soldier’s house to ask. Once there, Soldier’s dad tells him about the stress of the last few days and all the relatives that have flown in for Soldier’s funeral. Hearing this, Pierce abandons the idea of asking them to change the date of the funeral and is now left conflicted.

He tells his mother that someone else has to be the best man, but she gets angry and tells him to go sit down. However, Pierce ends up getting a car and drives to Soldier’s funeral only to be late and miss it.

Any foreign citizen who is able to find a path into the U.S. is eligible to apply for refugee protection in the form of political asylum. At the time of filming, all requests for asylum were handled by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Behind the doors of the asylum office lies a dramatic real-life stage where American ideals about human rights collide with the nearly impossible task of trying to know the truth. The film shows the closed corridors of the INS for an extraordinary close-up look at what has been called the Ellis Island of the 21st Century. It is an intimate world never before seen on screen—asylum officers, lawyers, translators, economic migrants, legitimate refugees looking for protection, all focused on the confidential interviews that are the heart of the asylum process. Cases examined within the film involve individuals originating from China, El Salvador, Albania, Nigeria, Romania, Algeria, France and Russia. The film reveals the challenges of determining the validity of claims made in the asylum interview process. The film closes with several onscreen statements about how the asylum application process has changed since filming. Congress passed legislation which reduces the number of people who are eligible to apply for asylum. The legislation also jails individuals arriving at U.S. borders requesting asylum. Additionally, the legislation limited an individual's right to appeal some of the decisions from asylum officers.

Overwhelmed by the loss of his mother and confronted by his own advancing age, Wexler embarks on a curious, lively, and sometimes troubling worldwide trek to investigate what it really means to live forever. Wexler’s search takes him to the places where people live the longest: from Okinawa, Japan to Iceland. He journeys to Las Vegas to attend a convention for funeral directors, and the Ms. Senior America Pageant. He contemplates a future in cold storage at the Alcor Life Extension Foundation cryonics facility in Arizona. Wexler even receives exercise tips from Jack LaLanne, hormone replacement advice from Suzanne Somers, and promises of eternal life from biogerontologist Aubrey de Grey. But whose advice should he take? Does Buster Martin, a chain-smoking, beer-drinking centenarian marathon-runner have all the answers? What about elder-porn star Shigeo Tokuda? The more Wexler travels into the strange worlds of Laughter Yoga, calorie restriction, and old-fashioned religion, the less sure he becomes of his goal. Can it be that life’s true meaning is found in the humble chili dog? Wexler contrasts unusual characters and philosophies with the insights of health, fitness and life-extension experts in his engaging new documentary. The film challenges our notions of youth and aging with comic poignancy. Begun as a study of prolonging life, How To Live Forever evolves into a fun and provocative examination of life’s deepest mystery.

Tormented in his dreams by memories and his secret aspiration for eternal peace. Taro is regularly 'inspected' by his former military inspector Yamada, who exploits the situation to entertain former Japanese officers, nostalgic of Imperial Japan, by luring visitors to the island through his War Veterans Association.

For the sadistic pleasure of the former Japanese officers, Yamada organises ""inspections"" during which the new recruits must prove their devotion to the emperor by sacrificing their lives. Many years later Shintaro, the son of the fisherman's daughter, finds himself on the island after searching for his father. He learns his father disappeared on the island just before the massacre. He contacts Yamada through the War Veterans Association, who agrees to take him and others to the island. But once they arrive he abandons them and puts Taro in charge. For Shintaro and his comrades this means forced enrolment, military drills and suffering. After months of torture Shintaro and the other captives start to accept Taro's twisted sense of reality.

There, Lincoln befriends a young African American boy, William Johnson , and intervenes when he sees Johnson being beaten by an overseer. Because of his son's actions, Thomas is fired. That night, Lincoln sees Barts break into his house and attack Nancy. She dies shortly afterwards. Thomas tells Lincoln that Barts poisoned Nancy. Nine years later, a vengeful Lincoln attacks Barts at the docks, but Barts, who is actually a vampire, overpowers him. However, before Barts can kill him, Lincoln is rescued by Henry Sturges . Sturges explains that vampires exist, and offers to teach Lincoln to be a vampire hunter. Lincoln accepts and, after a decade of training, travels to Springfield, Illinois. During his training, Sturges tells Lincoln that the vampires in America descend from Adam , a vampire who owns a plantation in New Orleans with his sister, Vadoma . Sturges also tells Lincoln of the vampires' weakness, silver, and presents him with a silver pocket watch. In Springfield, Lincoln befriends shopkeeper Joshua Speed , and meets Mary Todd . Though Sturges warned him not to form any close relationships, Lincoln develops romantic feelings for Mary. Lincoln successfully finds and defeats Barts. Before dying, Barts reveals that Sturges is also a vampire. Lincoln confronts Sturges, who reveals that, many years ago, he and his wife were attacked and bitten by Adam. Adam turned Sturges and killed his wife. Now that Sturges was a vampire he could not kill Adam or any other vampire . Sturges has since been training vampire hunters, hoping to destroy Adam. Disappointed, Lincoln decides to abandon his mission. However, Adam learns of his activities and kidnaps Johnson to lure Lincoln into a trap at his plantation. Adam captures Lincoln and tries to recruit him, revealing his plans to turn the United States into a nation of the undead. Speed rescues his friends, and they escape to Ohio. Lincoln marries Mary and begins his political career, campaigning to abolish slavery. Sturges warns Lincoln that the slave trade keeps vampires under control, as vampires use slaves for food, and if Lincoln interferes, the vampires will retaliate. After Lincoln's election as President of the United States of America, he moves to the White House with Mary, where they have a son, William Wallace Lincoln . William is later bitten by Vadoma and dies. Confederate President Jefferson Davis  convinces Adam to deploy his vampires, and this impacts the first day at Gettysburg. Lincoln orders the confiscation of all the silverware to produce silver weapons. Speed, believing that Lincoln is tearing the nation apart, informs Adam that Lincoln will transport the silver by train. On the train, Adam and Vadoma, who have set fire to the upcoming trestle, attack Lincoln, Sturges, and Johnson. During the fight Adam learns that the train holds only rocks. Speed reveals that his betrayal was a ruse to lure Adam into a trap, and Adam kills Speed for this. Lincoln wraps his silver watch around his fist and punches through Adam's chest, killing him, and Lincoln escapes the exploding train alongside his allies. Meanwhile, Mary and the ex-slaves have transported the silver to Gettysburg through the Underground Railroad - it is here that Vadoma is killed by Mary. The now leaderless Confederate vampires stage a final, massive assault and are met head on by the Union. Armed with their silver weapons, the Union soldiers destroy the vampires and eventually win the war. Nearly two years later, on April 14, 1865, Sturges tells Lincoln that the remaining vampires have fled the country. Sturges tries to convince Lincoln to allow him to turn Lincoln into a vampire, so that he can become immortal and continue to fight vampires, but Lincoln declines and leaves for the theater with his wife, apparently implying he is soon to be assassinated by John Wilkes Booth. In modern times, Sturges approaches a man  at a bar in Washington, D.C. as he once approached Lincoln.

Anna is a British exchange student who, having fallen in love with Jacob, a design student, spends the summer with him, overstaying her student visa after it had expired on graduation. She returns home to London for a family obligation, and when she flies back to Los Angeles as a tourist she is detained, denied entry, turned away, and sent back to England by Los Angeles airport immigration officials, throwing the couple into an awkward and strained long-distance relationship. Anna is banned from entering the United States for this prior violation of having overstayed her original visa. The deep love of the couple is strained by the distance and frustration of not being able to see each other except when Jacob can make the time away from his successful design business in Los Angeles to visit Anna in England. Anna's family in England hires an immigration lawyer to try to get the ban lifted and allow Anna to return to Jacob in the United States.{{cite news}} Anna's father suggests that marrying may help to get the ban lifted. Upon Jacob's return to the US, and after an undisclosed time, he begins a relationship with someone else, a work colleague . Anna continues to struggle with her feelings for Jacob and eventually phones him up suggesting that they should marry, that no other relationships that they experience are like the one they have together. Jacob returns to the UK once again and marries Anna in a small court ceremony with her parents as witness. They are told to wait 6 months before appealing the ban on Anna's visa again, and Jacob returns to the UK after these 6 months for the appeal, which is again unsuccessful and the relationship of Anna and Jacob is compromised. They again begin relationships with other people, but Anna and Jacob still feel a profound connection with each other. Anna gets promoted at her work to a position that she is really happy about. Anna's boyfriend at the time, Simon, proposes to her. Shortly after, Anna finds out from her lawyer that her ban from the United States has finally been lifted. She gives up her job, her current boyfriend and her apartment and she returns to Los Angeles to Jacob. Jacob greets Anna at the airport with flowers and the two have the reconciliation that they didn't have after Anna was first banned, although it seems to lack the passion you see earlier in their relationship. Reunited and without any legal impediments to being together, Anna and Jacob are shown to be starting a life together. The film closes with the two in the shower reminiscing their initial courtship. They appear somewhat strained likely because their journey together has had many ups and downs. The movie ends with both characters reflecting back on a cascade of clips of their initial encounters together. The future of Jacob and Anna's relationship is unclear.

31008706	/m/0gg9fr3	Wish 143			24	{}	{}	"{""/m/02hmvc"": ""Short Film""}"	David, a 15 year-old living in the Cancer ward of a children’s hospital, is asked by Dreamscape Charity representative for his biggest dream. David states that he would like to lose his virginity before he dies. The shocked representative attempts to talk David into meeting a celebrity, but David insists that losing his virginity is all he wants. This statement creates a minor media splash, much to the consternation of a Priest in the hospital. The Priest tries to convince him to have sex for love, while David insists “I don’t have time for love!” David meets with his ex-girlfriend Amy. During the visit Amy tells him that although she thinks of him often, she’s dating someone else. She leaves a letter with him and leaves. David stuffs the unread letter into his pocket and sneaks out of the hospital. He goes to a red light district and attempts to solicit a prostitute. The woman he approaches tells him to use the money to “buy something nice for your mother.” An upset David picks up bricks and starts throwing them at cars until he is arrested. When the priest picks him at the police station he asks him why he did it. David responds “I wanted to see how low I could go.” The priest finds the unopened letter from Amy and reads it. In it Amy states that, while she is flattered by the proposition of having David lose his virginity to her, she feels like she cannot do it. She continues by writing she hopes he gets better soon, and she’s sure that when he does she’ll find a nice girl who loves him. The Priest knows what Amy does not, the cancer is spreading and “getting better” is not a possibility. Later that night the Priest wakes David up and takes him via motorcycle to see a prostitute. He tells her she is very nice and gently reminds him that he doesn’t have to do anything he doesn’t want to. While inside David nervously talks to the girl. She asks him what he wants to do and he replies “I don’t know, what do you want to do?” The girl smiles and states she has never been asked that before. She takes off his shirt revealing several tubes and scars coming from his chest. David explains that various treatments that he’s had. She responds by showing him her own scar. She tells him he’s handsome and asks if anyone has told him that. David replies people tell him how sick he is. She touches his shoulder and asks him if anyone touches him. David replies he is only touched by doctors who are checking vital signs. David asks the girl to lie in bed and hold him “that’s all that I want.” David cries while she gently holds and comforts him. The Dreamscape Charity representative returns and asks again if there are any wishes that David wants. A much more contented David says he doesn’t need anything. The representative smiles and tells a story about how the charity arranged for a kid to meet an entire sports team, but at the last minute the kid changed his mind and instead used the van to go on a fishing trip with his uncle. “There’s a real wish.” The representative wishes him luck and leaves. In the end, David realizes he has found the love of friendship with the Priest who has been helping him, and they spend a day together clay pigeon shooting.

Thomas's parents go away for the weekend, leaving him alone in the house, but warn him not to have too many people over, and not to drive his father's Mercedes. Thomas is reluctant to have the party at his house, but Costa continues with his plan. Costa hires AV-student Dax to chronicle the night's events. Costa and J.B. advertise the party throughout the school. Thomas himself invites Alexis, the hottest girl at school, and his best friend Kirby, who has a crush on Thomas. Costa, Thomas, and J.B. go to buy marijuana from drug-dealer T-Rick. While T-Rick gets the marijuana, Costa steals his lawn gnome to use as a party mascot. As they leave, T-Rick discovers his gnome stolen and chases after them but they escape in Thomas' mini-van. As night falls, the party's start time passes but no one turns up and Thomas worries that the party will fail. Suddenly, party-goers arrive en-masse. Thomas intends to limit the party to the backyard and poolhouse with the house guarded by two young security guards, Everett and Tyler. However, more and more people begin to arrive and the party moves beyond their control and into the house. Thomas questions Costa on how he advertised the party, forcing him to confess that he put ads on Craigslist and on a local radio station, worried that no one would attend. As the party grows, T-Rick's gnome is smashed, revealing that it contains a large amount of ecstasy tablets, which are quickly consumed by the partygoers. The police arrive, responding to a noise complaint, but the party goers remain silent, convincing the officers that the party has already ended. After the police leave and the party resumes, Thomas kisses Kirby and reveals that he loves her. Alexis meanwhile flirts with Thomas throughout the night and eventually seduces him. Kirby walks in on the pair as they are about to have sex and leaves the party upset. The noise and chaos of the party, which has now spilled out into the surrounding neighborhood, receives televised news coverage with helicopters flying over the house. A dwarf guest drives Thomas' dad's Mercedes into the pool after being put into an oven by other partygoers. The police return in force but are overwhelmed and repelled by the guests. They decide to let the party end naturally before moving in. T-Rick arrives armed with a flamethrower in an attempt to reclaim his gnome. He begins setting fire to the trees and cars in search of Costa, forcing the guests to flee and the party to end. The police shoot his flamethrower pack and it explodes. Thomas, Costa, J.B., and Dax flee with the other guests as Thomas' house burns and the SWAT team moves in to retake the neighborhood. The neighborhood is left aflame. By morning, the friends return to their respective homes to discover what punishment awaits them. After his parents return, Thomas' father commends him for managing to throw the party because he thought he was a loser, but he uses Thomas' college fund to pay for the damages. At school, Thomas, Costa and J.B. are cheered by the students and Thomas reconciles romantically with Kirby. In the epilogue, T-Rick is recovered alive following the explosion, Thomas is convicted for disturbing the peace, contributing to the delinquency of minors, and inciting a riot, and Costa and J.B. are acquitted; Costa because of his expensive lawyer and J.B. because his parents convince the court that he is mentally incapable and unfit to stand trial. Costa, however, is currently waiting for the results of three paternity tests. Dax, meanwhile, is under investigation for the disappearance of his parents. In an interview with Jillian Reynolds, Costa promises his next party will be even better.

The film is about two youngsters, both of whom are quite the ideal children. Imagine a girl who makes a guy wait hoping to get her parents to approve his proposal; or a guy who says, “I’ve met the girls parents, I see them in her eyes”. These are the stuff most of the typical families dream of, as they plan their kids’ futures. The film has its funny moments and occasionally, an overdose of sentimental scenes. The director has done a fairly decent job with the narrative and Yash impresses in his role as the lovelorn urban lad. His dancing skills deserve special mention — he’s easily one of the best we have in Sandalwood. New girl Bhama makes a decent debut, though Deepu, who has dubbed for her, deserves equal applause. Rangayana Raghu and Tara excel, the film shows Raghu in a different light, as opposed to his over-the-top comical roles.

Emilia often picks up tramps in hope to reform them into productive men, but they always disappear stealing anything they can in the house. In the surrounding woods, Alberto Medina, a famous songwriter, is on a vacations hunting trip. While the old car he is driving falls off a wreckage he has to walk to find help and ends up in the Valverde's home, but for his dirty and ragged clothes Emilia takes him for a tramp and invites him to stay with them. For some inexplicable reason Alberto accepts, despite the protests of Emilia's family and their butler, but in the next days he proves to be more than a regular homeless man: helping Miguel when he arrives home drunk, enchanting the heart of Suzi, and especially during a business dinner where he secures Miguel a financial investment support from a bank manager, but also making Suzi jealous after the manager's daughter, Patricia, insists on dating him the next day. Alberto ends up having a date with Patricia, first at a country club and later to an undisclosed place. During that day two policemen find the destroyed car at the wreckage and find the owner, who confirms that Alberto was riding the car and they assume he died in the accident. Alberto goes back to the Valverde's later that night and realizes he has no key so he falls asleep in the back room. The next morning when they look for Alberto they don't find him in the bedroom, then Miguel reads a note in the newspaper where they inform he died in a car accident, causing a chaotic chain of faints and madness around the house. During the confusion Alberto finally finds Suzi  and kisses her declaring their love.

While the old car he is driving falls off a wreckage he has to walk to find help and ends up in the Valverde's home, but for his dirty and ragged clothes Emilia takes him for a tramp and invites him to stay with them. For some inexplicable reason Alberto accepts, despite the protests of Emilia's family and their butler, but in the next days he proves to be more than a regular homeless man: helping Miguel when he arrives home drunk, enchanting the heart of Suzi, and especially during a business dinner where he secures Miguel a financial investment support from a bank manager, but also making Suzi jealous after the manager's daughter, Patricia, insists on dating him the next day. Alberto ends up having a date with Patricia, first at a country club and later to an undisclosed place. During that day two policemen find the destroyed car at the wreckage and find the owner, who confirms that Alberto was riding the car and they assume he died in the accident. Alberto goes back to the Valverde's later that night and realizes he has no key so he falls asleep in the back room. The next morning when they look for Alberto they don't find him in the bedroom, then Miguel reads a note in the newspaper where they inform he died in a car accident, causing a chaotic chain of faints and madness around the house. During the confusion Alberto finally finds Suzi  and kisses her declaring their love.

While the old car he is driving falls off a wreckage he has to walk to find help and ends up in the Valverde's home, but for his dirty and ragged clothes Emilia takes him for a tramp and invites him to stay with them. For some inexplicable reason Alberto accepts, despite the protests of Emilia's family and their butler, but in the next days he proves to be more than a regular homeless man: helping Miguel when he arrives home drunk, enchanting the heart of Suzi, and especially during a business dinner where he secures Miguel a financial investment support from a bank manager, but also making Suzi jealous after the manager's daughter, Patricia, insists on dating him the next day. Alberto ends up having a date with Patricia, first at a country club and later to an undisclosed place. During that day two policemen find the destroyed car at the wreckage and find the owner, who confirms that Alberto was riding the car and they assume he died in the accident. Alberto goes back to the Valverde's later that night and realizes he has no key so he falls asleep in the back room. The next morning when they look for Alberto they don't find him in the bedroom, then Miguel reads a note in the newspaper where they inform he died in a car accident, causing a chaotic chain of faints and madness around the house. During the confusion Alberto finally finds Suzi  and kisses her declaring their love.

Alberto goes back to the Valverde's later that night and realizes he has no key so he falls asleep in the back room. The next morning when they look for Alberto they don't find him in the bedroom, then Miguel reads a note in the newspaper where they inform he died in a car accident, causing a chaotic chain of faints and madness around the house. During the confusion Alberto finally finds Suzi  and kisses her declaring their love.

During an official visit of the president Tito to Cuba in 1979, the attention of the capital was directed to the Phantom in the white Porsche. The Mysterious driver that drove like crazy in a stolen car over the square Slavija made in the midnight hours a real spectacle, constantly managed to get away from the police. Over the radio he openly called the police to catch him, what was the first oppositional act in the post-war Yugoslavia. Several tens of thousand people went on the streets to support him.

His voice over explains “You can’t control who you fall in love with, or who falls in love with you. Love doesn’t make sense.” The film flashes back to three months earlier to Ray’s time as a confident, self-centered lounge singer/dart thrower. Ray’s band consists of his friends Fozzie , Frank  and the “love of his life” Kelly . Before he joins the band onstage, Ray prays to God asking him for assistance in getting Kelly to love him. Despite Ray’s ongoing affection to her, she seems drawn to Fozzie who, claiming he's genuinely uninterested, is rejecting Kelly’s advances. After Ray’s crowd pleasing performance, he is informed by the bartender that someone has left a package for him. The package contains “love darts.” The instructions for the darts explain that when someone is poked with love dart they are immediately attracted to the first person they see. This attraction lasts for 6 hours. At the end of the 6 hours if the love is meant to last it will, but if the love wasn't meant to be, it won’t. Ray tells Fozzie about the darts and they both agree to have a test run. While the band walks home from a gig, Ray throws a love dart catching a prissy Jersey Girl named Angela. The first man she sees is Ray’s quiet, low-key bandmate Frank. Just as the instructions promised, Angela falls in love with Frank immediately. Ray and Fozzie follow the new couple around. After exactly six hours, Angela appears to still be in love with Frank and Ray declares the darts “effective.” Ray enlists Fozzie’s help in creating the “most romantic six hours” ensuring that Kelly will remain in love with Ray after the love dart’s initial power ends. Fozzie is able to offer several tips, knowing a surprising amount about Kelly and the things that are important to her. Ray goes to Kelly’s house and strikes her with a dart. As promised by the dart’s instructions, she immediately falls in love with him. They go on their date which goes perfectly. Towards the end of the six hours they kiss. When the six hours end, Kelly looks uncomfortable, thanks him for the evening, and leaves. It is clear that the love from the dart did not last. Ray consoles himself by poking one woman after another until he has a whole flock of women  who are completely in love with him for six hours. During this time all he can do is talk about getting Kelly to fall in love with him again. He even contemplates convincing her that she has diabetes so she has to poke herself with the love darts over and over again. The love darts wear off and he is alone again, ready to try his last dart on Kelly one more time. Walking home from another gig with his band, Ray prepares for his final throw at Kelly. Moments before throwing the dart he realizes that his loyal friend Fozzie is really in love with her and that she is really in love with him. Instead of striking Kelly with the dart, he hits Fozzie right as he looks up at Kelly. The two instantly fall in love with each other. A wiser and less self-centered Ray returns to his apartment. He finds another mysterious box outside his apartment with a note that says “nice work.” He opens the box and finds Cupid’s bow and arrow. The film flashes forward to three months in the future at the point the film began. The band continues but without Ray; Angela is the new singer. Frank & Angela and Fozzie & Kelly are still very much in love. Ray is many miles away driving on his motor scooter on the country road his bow and arrow tied to his back. He repeats “you can’t control who you love, or who loves you.” He ends by saying that love doesn’t make sense. He knows all this because “I am the God of the Love.”

The package contains “love darts.” The instructions for the darts explain that when someone is poked with love dart they are immediately attracted to the first person they see. This attraction lasts for 6 hours. At the end of the 6 hours if the love is meant to last it will, but if the love wasn't meant to be, it won’t. Ray tells Fozzie about the darts and they both agree to have a test run. While the band walks home from a gig, Ray throws a love dart catching a prissy Jersey Girl named Angela. The first man she sees is Ray’s quiet, low-key bandmate Frank. Just as the instructions promised, Angela falls in love with Frank immediately. Ray and Fozzie follow the new couple around. After exactly six hours, Angela appears to still be in love with Frank and Ray declares the darts “effective.” Ray enlists Fozzie’s help in creating the “most romantic six hours” ensuring that Kelly will remain in love with Ray after the love dart’s initial power ends. Fozzie is able to offer several tips, knowing a surprising amount about Kelly and the things that are important to her. Ray goes to Kelly’s house and strikes her with a dart. As promised by the dart’s instructions, she immediately falls in love with him. They go on their date which goes perfectly. Towards the end of the six hours they kiss. When the six hours end, Kelly looks uncomfortable, thanks him for the evening, and leaves. It is clear that the love from the dart did not last. Ray consoles himself by poking one woman after another until he has a whole flock of women  who are completely in love with him for six hours. During this time all he can do is talk about getting Kelly to fall in love with him again. He even contemplates convincing her that she has diabetes so she has to poke herself with the love darts over and over again. The love darts wear off and he is alone again, ready to try his last dart on Kelly one more time. Walking home from another gig with his band, Ray prepares for his final throw at Kelly. Moments before throwing the dart he realizes that his loyal friend Fozzie is really in love with her and that she is really in love with him. Instead of striking Kelly with the dart, he hits Fozzie right as he looks up at Kelly. The two instantly fall in love with each other. A wiser and less self-centered Ray returns to his apartment. He finds another mysterious box outside his apartment with a note that says “nice work.” He opens the box and finds Cupid’s bow and arrow. The film flashes forward to three months in the future at the point the film began. The band continues but without Ray; Angela is the new singer. Frank & Angela and Fozzie & Kelly are still very much in love. Ray is many miles away driving on his motor scooter on the country road his bow and arrow tied to his back. He repeats “you can’t control who you love, or who loves you.” He ends by saying that love doesn’t make sense. He knows all this because “I am the God of the Love.”

The Pirate Captain, inexpert in the ways of pirates, leads a close-knit, rag-tag group of amateur pirates who are trying to make a name for themselves on the high seas. To prove himself and his crew, the Pirate Captain enters the Pirate of the Year competition, with the winner being whoever can plunder the most. After several failed attempts to plunder mundane ships, the Pirate Captain talks with his close first mate, the Pirate with a Scarf, about giving up and selling baby clothes as a living, but is convinced to try boarding the next ship they find, which happens to be the Beagle. They find no treasure but succeed in capturing Charles Darwin. Darwin recognizes the crew's pet Polly as the last living dodo, and implores the Pirate Captain to enter it into the Scientist of the Year competition at the Royal Academy in London for a valuable prize. The Pirate Captain directs his ship to London, despite being warned of Queen Victoria's hatred for pirates. Darwin desires to win the Scientist prize on his own in order to impress Queen Victoria, on whom he has a crush. He uses Mr. Bobo, his trained chimpanzee who was from an old theory that parodies his own theory, to try to steal Polly. The Pirate with the Scarf witnesses the kidnapping but the attempt goes awry after alerting the other pirates. Darwin avoids implicating himself much to the Pirate with the Scarf's frustration, but now the Pirate Captain insists on hiding the bird and entering the competition on his own. The display of the dodo takes the top prize: a minuscule trophy, an Encyclopedia set and an opportunity to meet the Queen. During the ceremony, the Pirate Captain accidentally reveals his pirate identity, but Darwin convinces the Queen to spare the Captain's life because he knows the location of Polly. The Queen lets the Captain go free with a full pardon, but orders Darwin to locate the dodo by any means necessary. Darwin takes the Pirate Captain to a tavern, and the latter ultimately reveals that he had stashed Polly in his beard. Darwin and Mr. Bobo are able to capture Polly and are chased by the Captain up into the Tower of London, where the Queen is waiting. The Queen quickly dismisses Darwin and Mr. Bobo, and then offers the Pirate Captain a large amount of treasure in exchange for the bird. Soon, the Pirate Captain reunites with his crew with his newfound wealth, stating that Polly is sleeping within his beard, and sets off for the Pirate of the Year ceremony. The Pirate with a Scarf expresses doubt to the validity of the Captain's story. At the ceremony, the Pirate Captain wins the grand prize from the Pirate King, but rival pirate Black Bellamy makes the Queen's pardon known to all pirates in attendance. The Captain is stripped of the prize, his plunder, and his pirating licensing, and on learning that he lied about Polly's fate, his crew abandons him as well. The Captain returns alone to London to sell baby clothes, but soon becomes determined to free Polly. He re-encounters a now-devastated Darwin, who has learned that the Queen is part of a secret dining society with several other world leaders who are now aboard her steamship, the QV1, waiting to eat Polly and several other endangered animals. The Pirate Captain enlists Darwin's help to steal a dirigible and rescue Polly. Aboard the QV1, the Pirate Captain and Darwin disrupt the meal, and are soon joined by the rest of the Captain's crew, having been informed by Mr. Bobo of his need. The Queen locates them and after justifying her reasons behind her hatred of pirates, attempts to kill both of them, but together they best her. In the battle, they accidentally mix the ship's store of baking powder with vinegar, causing a violent reaction that rends the ship in two. The Pirate Captain rescues Polly and they escape safely, leaving behind a furious Queen. With his reputation among pirates restored because of the large bounty now on his head, the Pirate Captain and his crew continue to explore the high seas in search of adventure. They leave Darwin on the Galapagos Islands, where he finally finds a girlfriend, and Mr. Bobo joins the Captain's crew. As for the Queen, she is left at the mercy of some of the rare animals she had planned on eating.
31052739	/m/0gg8hw5	Zoomates	1998		8	{}	{}	"{""/m/02hmvc"": ""Short Film""}"	"A woman named Helen , who works at the zoo, tells her boss Mr. Sutten  that she doesn't think it's right for the animals to be trapped there, she argues that they should live in houses like humans. After a failed attempt at disposing of her with a trapdoor, Mr. Sutten gives her three animals, Mark the Polar Bear , Paul the Alligator , and Warren the Ostrich , and makes a deal - If she can take them home and prove they are able to conventionally live in a house like the average human, he will shut down the zoo and release them all. Helen takes the animals back to her apartment for the night and leaves them with a manual on how to live there, telling them she'll check up on them again in the morning. The animals first find her washing machine and dryer, which Mark goes into assuming it's where he is supposed to bathe when the others question what it's for. When he comes out, he feels dizzy from the spinning and bumps into a shelf, knocking a bottle of floor wax onto the ground, causing the slippery wax to then spill across the floor and prevent them from being able to get up. Somebody then appears at the door, and upon trying to get over and answer it the three animals find they slip over every time. Mark tries to resolve the problem by kicking Paul and Warren across the room, but this causes disaster when they crash straight through the door and knock the man down the stairs. At the bottom the man tells them he had come to offer them spiritual enlightenment, which Paul declines, claiming he heard it's ""high in sodium"". Later, Mark takes some ice from the fridge and puts it on his bed in an attempt to make it feel more like his bed at home. During the night, however, all the ice below him melts and floods the apartment, as well as waking up the others. The water then reacts with an electrical outlet, causing a fire. In attempt to stop the fire, Paul checks Helen's manual, which tells them in the case of a fire the apartment's sprinkler system will start automatically. The sprinkler then turns on, which resolves the fire but contributes to the flood. Now desperately trying to work out how to prevent the flood from getting even worse, Paul reads aloud that the sprinkler system will turn off manually, but he misunderstands the meaning of the word, asking ""Where are we supposed to find a man at this hour?"" Warren suggests that if they wait, the sprinkler system may just turn off by itself... The next morning Helen arrives back at the apartment, seeing water flowing out from underneath the door as she arrives. When she opens it, much to her dismay a huge gush comes out and washes her away, after which she finds her apartment in a huge mess. Helen asks the animals ""What on Earth happened?"" with Paul responding ""We had a little accident"", although Warren attempts to lighten the situation by reassuring her that they ""kept the place intact"". This is soon proved wrong when Mark leans against the wall, his hand going straight through it and consequently causing the entire building to collapse. The cartoon ends with a disappointed Helen breaking the fourth wall, saying ""This is going to be tougher than I thought""."

The same plan is being discussed between a roofing contractor named Kenny Bostick  and second wife Jesse , the current big year record holder fearing his record of 732 species is to be topped. Stu Preissler , founder and CEO of a company bearing his name, sits at his Manhattan office headquarters, talking fondly of his hobby of birding, his colleagues made aware of his pressing desire to set a new big year record which is to commence after New Year's. At his parents' house over dinner, Brad reveals to his father  he has begun his big year and the travel costs necessary to undertake his dream have already been budgeted. His father objects, feeling his 36-year old cash-strapped son should instead focus on his career. Brad is resolute, however, encouraged by his mother . After receiving notification of a Xantus's Hummingbird sighting, Stu is unsuccessfully tempted by his former company colleagues  to return to New York City. Unbeknownst to Stu, Bostick arrives at the same house in British Columbia. Bostick again comes into contact with Stu when the two men are aboard a birding boat. Aware he may have a fellow birder on his tail, Bostick engages in antics to worsen Stu's seasickness. Brad befriends a nauseous Stu and also meets for the first time fellow birder Ellie . Bostick's wife attempts to gain her husband's attention back on the home front, informing him she has decided to hire out a rival contractor to begin work on remodeling their home. Stu is also pressured again by his former company, this time onsite, begging him to return to help close a deal. Reluctantly, he agrees to depart for two days. The three birders all rush to the Gulf Coast area to view fallout of birds before a storm. Hundreds of birders flock to the area, including Ellie, much to Brad's delight. After spending the day together, Brad and Stu dine together, when Brad discloses he is currently doing a big year. Stu decides against sharing the same, fearing his new-found friend may innocently reveal to Bostick his own pursuit. While birding in Coos Bay, a friend of Brad's  comes to discover Stu's growing list and posts a picture of him to his website, which makes Brad aware that Stu is pursuing a big year . Feeling hurt, Brad divulges Stu's goal to Bostick while the two are aboard a plane on their way to Attu Island. Stu was booked on the same chartered flight but narrowly missed it, largely held up by his work. His disappointment only worsens watching local news anchormen stating the storm created prime birding conditions on Attu. Meanwhile, A Rustic Bunting is sighted on the island by Bostick. Stu arrives days later and makes amends with Brad, wanting to remain friends. He encourages Brad in his pursuit of Ellie, who also made the trip, as well as suggesting they team up so at least one of them can break Bostick's record. Ellie calls Brad to inform him a Pink-footed Goose has been spotted in Boston. Any thoughts he had of pursuing her are dashed, however, when she and her boyfriend pick him up from the train station. Stu and Brad meet up again, finding out each has totaled more than 700 species thus far, and bump into Bostick but are soon outwitted by him in their attempt to a see a Blue-footed Booby, causing the two to form an alliance, the well-heeled CEO paying for a helicopter ride to see snowcocks. Upon landing, Brad is notified his father suffered a heart attack and returns to be with him. His father comes to affectionately view his son with a new found respect after hearing Brad explain his love for his favorite bird, the American Golden Plover. Bostick's wife awaits him at a fertility clinic, but despite their agreement, Bostick cancels on her at the last minute after being notified a Snowy Owl, his most coveted bird, has been spotted and would also help allow him in breaking his own record. When he returns home, he finds the constant traveling has been too taxing on his wife, whom he suspects may have become involved with the contractor working on their home, despite her statements quite to the contrary. Calling from his home, Stu phones Brad with the final big year results. Bostick is first with 755. Coming in second, Brad laments ""he got more birds, but we got more everything,"" as he looks at his new love interest, Ellie who's come for a weekend visit. Stu smiles, staring at his wife. The film ends with the new couple gazing through binoculars, Stu hiking with his toddler grandson birding enamored by birds of the Rockies, and Bostick on a birding adventure in China, seemingly alone."

Since their music is aimed solely at the smallest, girliest of consumers  and written by their producers Samson en Gert , who may collectively be remembered as the Belgian Walt Disney in years to come , this movie was a sure fire hit. Like the Monkees, K3 go by their own names, live and sleep together and perform songs while remaining a struggling band . Unlike the Spice Girls, this film knows where it's audience lies and has no trouble reaching it. Surprisingly, the girls do not perform much music at all: only three numbers, all of which are used as background music. Phoney Italian crook Frederico Gazpacho  wants to get his hands on an ancient Egyptian 'Washabi' Medallion, which just happens to be hidden away in the house of the late adventurer and architect who found the amulet, and I bet you can guess which threesome are just about to move into that faithful house. Kristel  picks up a ""Mega Macy"" comic book, which not only foreshadows things to come but is also an excuse to give the entire film a comic book look, complete with stylish black and white panels substituting for scene changes . Naturally the three of them find the amulet hidden in a wall almost immediately and, unaware of its powers, Kathleen  decides to wear it around her neck. Gazpacho sends his two silly henchmen to get the hidden treasure: Rode Tijger  is the dumb fat one who never shuts up, Zwarte Panter  is the Chinese girl who never speaks and who's Kung Fu is, shall we say, not all that impressive. The magic amulet grants wishes, and each time one of the girls happens to make one, little animated gold stars do their handy work. About half way through, Dutch loud mouth and incredibly gay comedian Paul de Leeuw makes his first appearance as the Genie of the Medaillon, painted gold and spitting out thought balloons and animated letters all over the place. You can see right through him, and it looks like all of his scenes were filmed separately. This makes me wonder if he ever met K3 during filming at all. De Leeuw is even more unbelievably loud and annoying than usual, because for some reason every European children's movie has to include at least one of these hyperactive character. Luckily, his scenes are kept to a bare minimum. Kathleen wishes to be a princess. Karin  wants to fly and Kristel asks for a mega-bike like Mega Macey. Soon they have spent 98 of their 100 wishes, and that's the moment the Genie chooses to explain the 100 wish limit. It's also the moment the nasties choose to reveal their dastardly intentions to the girls, forcing Kristel to use the penultimate wish to turn all three of them into Mega Macey . The special effects, cinematography and production design are quite impressive by Studio 100 standards, even the script by Samson & Gert is funnier than their usual material, patented for the K3 audience of pre teenager girls. Although the running time of the film is less than an hour , I believe a short film starring another Verhulst/Verbiest franchise was featured as an appetizer: Piet Piraat, who's movie resume at the time of this writing is a tie with the K3 girls: two each. There's also a superhero spin off television series called ""Mega Mindy"". Samson & Gert truly are unstoppable."

Six weeks after her wedding, as Ava and her younger sister Shelby  are preparing a guest list for their parents surprise 30th wedding anniversary, their parents appear at Ava's office arguing with one another. Betty reveals to Ava that Bradley had an affair 25 years ago, and declares that she wants a divorce. When Ava tries to counsel them, they refuse because she is their daughter and much less maritally experienced. Ava decides to try and save her parents' marriage. When her mother refuses to live with her father, she moves her father into her house, without consulting Charlie. Charlie is upset because Ava didn't ask him first. She apologizes to Charlie and promises that her father will only stay with them for a short period. Their friend, Gerber, suddenly shows up at their door with his new Polish wife, Kasia, whom he had met the night before in a bar. Gerber tells Ava about Charlie’s first marriage ten years ago, which she didn't know about. The revelation upsets Ava, and Charlie apologies for not telling her about it earlier. He explains that it took place under the influence of alcohol when he was 22 years old, and only lasted for a few weeks. Due to Ava’s father living with them, and her obsessing over trying to repair her parents' marriage, Ava & Charlie’s own marriage deteriorates because they are not having sex. Ava sends her parents to a different counselor, who suggests that they follow the “death break” therapy - no contact with one another so that they feel the absence, and therefore value each other, which is supposed to bring them closer together. Ava knows that this therapy only works over long periods of time, which, due to the party, she doesn’t have. She decides to take them to another counselor, along with Charlie. During one of the exercises, one spouse climbs a rock tower while the other spouse holds the rope which helps build trust between the partners. During the exercise, Ava's parents get into an argument and her father leaves the rope, leaving Betty suspended in air calling for help. Ava leaves her own rope, which is supporting Charlie, and tries to help her mother, which results in Charlie falling, injuring his back and neck. Ava apologizes, but he warns her that her distracted behavior is causing a increasing gulf between them. In secret, Ava continues planning the 30th anniversary surprise party. However, her mother throws a wrench in her plans and tells Ava that she is leaving on a trip to South Asia in 10 days for six months. Ava feels that her plan to bring her parents back together is failing, so she decides to play a trick on them in a last-ditch effort. She enlists Charlie to take her father out for a men's night and bring him back to the house later. Charlie takes her father to a bar where Gerber meets them. Much to Charlie's chagrin, Gerber takes them to a stripper club. At the club, the men drink excessively and Bradley enjoys the strip club’s dancers. Gerber tells Bradley that, because he is rich, he can marry a young, hot girl from Europe. Charlie and Bradley are drunk when they reach home where Ava is waiting with her mother. Under the influence of Gerber's advice, a drunken Bradley tells Betty that she can leave because he wants to marry one of the young European girls, which effectively destroys Ava's plan. Ava gets angry with Charlie for his childish behavior, which spoiled her last chance to bring her parents together. In response, Charlie complains that their lack of a sex life is caused by Ava's excessive determination to avoid her parents' inevitable divorce. Shelby decides to take Betty to a Speed Dating party so that she can meet other men. During the party, Betty meets many men, but realizes that none can replace her husband. Meanwhile, at Ava's, Bradley asks Ava to give him some pills to help him sleep. Ava concedes, and tells her father to take two pills, but he takes three and falls dead asleep. Then, Ava deviously flushes away the rest of pills in the toilet and calls an ambulance, claiming that her father took all of the sleeping pills of the bottle in a suicide attempt. The paramedics take Bradley to the hospital where he is admitted. Then, Ava calls her mother and informs her that Bradley tried to commit suicide after losing her. Betty rushes to the hospital where Ava and Charlie are already waiting. Bradley's doctor tells them that he hadn't, in fact, taken many of the pills and that he'll be fine. Betty goes in to Bradley’s room where they reunite, and Betty tells Bradley that she realized that in spite of their disagreements, he is the best man she'd ever known. Charlie asks Ava about the number of pills Bradley had taken, and she admits that she had created the whole incident in an attempt to bring her parents together. Charlie is upset by this and yells at Ava for her manipulative behavior, and for not telling him about her plan, after which he storms out of the hospital. When Ava and Shelby are about to leave the hospital, they discover that Bradley had produced a son from the affair that Bradley didn't know about. However, Betty has forgiven Bradley and welcomes his son into the family. Later that night, when Ava reaches home, she discovers that Charlie had left, leaving a note saying that he is “staying at Gerber's… need some time.” The next day, Ava goes in to Charlie’s office to apologize for her actions, and asks him to come back home. He replies that “he can't answer that right now”. She invites him to her parents' 30th anniversary party, which is now back on, but he declines, saying that he isn't in the mood for celebrating. Upon hearing this, Ava becomes enraged and accuses Charlie of having an affair with his secretary, Adriana. He denies that there is an affair, questions her motives for marrying him, suggesting that perhaps she had only done so to boost her career and lend credibility to her marriage counseling business. Ava is stunned, and leaves when Charlie takes a business call. The next day, Gerber kicks Charlie out because Kasia’s parents, two brothers, and three cousins are on their way for a visit. Charlie is surprised to hear Gerber talk to his wife in Polish, and questions him. Gerber says that if you love someone and want to live a successful married life, you have to accept and respect their family as well. At her parents' house, Ava asks her father for a drink so that she can keep herself in control during the Anniversary party, still reeling from the breakdown of her own marriage. Then, she takes her parents to the party, where they are surprised and pleased. Ava, who is sitting alone thinking about her ruined married, is approached by Shelby, who is worried about her and asks where Charlie is, to which Ava replies, “I don’t think he is going to make it.” Shelby gets upset, and tells Ava that she only has herself to blame for her failing marriage, as she neglected Charlie in her quest to save her parents' marriage, first denying her husband sex and then baselessly accusing him of adultery. Ava apologizes and admits that she isn't perfect and may not know everything about marriage. Shelby responds that she should say that to Charlie, at which Ava rushes out of the party to find Charlie, but meets him as he's on the way in to find her. She apologizes for her behavior and they renew their wedding vows. When Charlie asks Ava if she wants to go back in to the party, she suggests they consummate their marriage instead. At the end of the film, footage is shown of Charlie with his and Ava's baby daughter laughing.

Six weeks after her wedding, as Ava and her younger sister Shelby  are preparing a guest list for their parents surprise 30th wedding anniversary, their parents appear at Ava's office arguing with one another. Betty reveals to Ava that Bradley had an affair 25 years ago, and declares that she wants a divorce. When Ava tries to counsel them, they refuse because she is their daughter and much less maritally experienced. Ava decides to try and save her parents' marriage. When her mother refuses to live with her father, she moves her father into her house, without consulting Charlie. Charlie is upset because Ava didn't ask him first. She apologizes to Charlie and promises that her father will only stay with them for a short period. Their friend, Gerber, suddenly shows up at their door with his new Polish wife, Kasia, whom he had met the night before in a bar. Gerber tells Ava about Charlie’s first marriage ten years ago, which she didn't know about. The revelation upsets Ava, and Charlie apologies for not telling her about it earlier. He explains that it took place under the influence of alcohol when he was 22 years old, and only lasted for a few weeks. Due to Ava’s father living with them, and her obsessing over trying to repair her parents' marriage, Ava & Charlie’s own marriage deteriorates because they are not having sex. Ava sends her parents to a different counselor, who suggests that they follow the “death break” therapy - no contact with one another so that they feel the absence, and therefore value each other, which is supposed to bring them closer together. Ava knows that this therapy only works over long periods of time, which, due to the party, she doesn’t have. She decides to take them to another counselor, along with Charlie. During one of the exercises, one spouse climbs a rock tower while the other spouse holds the rope which helps build trust between the partners. During the exercise, Ava's parents get into an argument and her father leaves the rope, leaving Betty suspended in air calling for help. Ava leaves her own rope, which is supporting Charlie, and tries to help her mother, which results in Charlie falling, injuring his back and neck. Ava apologizes, but he warns her that her distracted behavior is causing a increasing gulf between them. In secret, Ava continues planning the 30th anniversary surprise party. However, her mother throws a wrench in her plans and tells Ava that she is leaving on a trip to South Asia in 10 days for six months. Ava feels that her plan to bring her parents back together is failing, so she decides to play a trick on them in a last-ditch effort. She enlists Charlie to take her father out for a men's night and bring him back to the house later. Charlie takes her father to a bar where Gerber meets them. Much to Charlie's chagrin, Gerber takes them to a stripper club. At the club, the men drink excessively and Bradley enjoys the strip club’s dancers. Gerber tells Bradley that, because he is rich, he can marry a young, hot girl from Europe. Charlie and Bradley are drunk when they reach home where Ava is waiting with her mother. Under the influence of Gerber's advice, a drunken Bradley tells Betty that she can leave because he wants to marry one of the young European girls, which effectively destroys Ava's plan. Ava gets angry with Charlie for his childish behavior, which spoiled her last chance to bring her parents together. In response, Charlie complains that their lack of a sex life is caused by Ava's excessive determination to avoid her parents' inevitable divorce. Shelby decides to take Betty to a Speed Dating party so that she can meet other men. During the party, Betty meets many men, but realizes that none can replace her husband. Meanwhile, at Ava's, Bradley asks Ava to give him some pills to help him sleep. Ava concedes, and tells her father to take two pills, but he takes three and falls dead asleep. Then, Ava deviously flushes away the rest of pills in the toilet and calls an ambulance, claiming that her father took all of the sleeping pills of the bottle in a suicide attempt. The paramedics take Bradley to the hospital where he is admitted. Then, Ava calls her mother and informs her that Bradley tried to commit suicide after losing her. Betty rushes to the hospital where Ava and Charlie are already waiting. Bradley's doctor tells them that he hadn't, in fact, taken many of the pills and that he'll be fine. Betty goes in to Bradley’s room where they reunite, and Betty tells Bradley that she realized that in spite of their disagreements, he is the best man she'd ever known.

Ralph had been bitten by a hamster which is really a lab rat, brought onto the plane by Henry  for his school students. Ralph is restrained, but not before he bites the flight attendant Paula . The plane is forced to make an emergency landing in Las Vegas, and once it has landed, air traffic control refuses to let it approach the gate. Disobeying orders, Captain Forrest  and his co-pilot Willsy  find a jetway operated by a baggage handler Ed Ramirez . Almost everyone evacuates the plane, except for the elderly couple Bev Stevens  and her paralyzed mute husband Doc Stevens , and the pilots, who try to keep the violent Ralph contained in an aircraft bathroom. However, they learn that they have been locked out of the airport. Soon, armed soldiers and what appear to be CDC scientists surround the terminal. One of the passengers, a military medic named Shilah Washington , reveals she has a medical kit in her bag in the plane's cargo hold. The lead flight attendant Jenny , Henry, Ed, Nial Britz , and Preston  sneak back into the plane to retrieve it. They retrieve Shilah's kit and Nial's gun and they try to leave the hold. While in the plane, Jenny is attacked by an infected Captain Forrest and Nial shoots and kills him, but it seems that some of the captain's blood had gotten into Nial's eye. They also discover Ralph has escaped from the bathroom, whereabouts unknown. When they meet up with the rest of the group, they begin to realize that the infection is probably a form of rabies spread through bites. Doc is bitten by an infected rat and the group decide to lock him and Paula away to prevent further infection. George , an unaccompanied minor, accuses Henry of being responsible for the infection by bringing rats onto the plane. Jenny talks to Henry and asks if George's accusations are true. When Henry tells Jenny that George is just confused, they reconcile, and are then attacked by the escaped Ralph. With the help of Ed and Shilah, Jenny and Henry kill Ralph by strangling him. A team of four heavily-armed officers administer drugs to the group, and release the infected passengers from their confinement. Before she can receive the drugs, an elderly woman named Louise Treadwell, is bitten by her infected cat. Doc, also infected, bites one of the officials. After shooting Doc, the officers and one of the passengers attempt to evacuate but are shot and killed by personnel outside the doors. Ed drags one surviving officer back inside, and the group hides in a catering truck from the infected. When they reach the catering truck, the passengers realize Nial is infected, and he grabs and attacks his wife. The group question the wounded officer, who reveals that he does not represent the CDC but rather the Department of Homeland Security's anti-biological terrorism division called Chemical Biological Domestic Terrorism . He tells them about a quarantined building in Los Angeles that housed a bioterrorist group's lab and confirms that the drugs are experimental antidotes, which Shilah had strongly suspected. The wounded officer grabs Nial's gun from Henry and kills himself. While in the catering truck, Ed soon reveals that the building has an old drainage tunnel and he tries to give them details, but Ed is attacked by co-pilot Willsy from the roof of the truck. George pushes a button to raise the truck and Willsy is crushed to death. The survivors try to access an old drainage tunnel through which they can escape the airport. One of the passengers is attacked, and Jenny, George, Shilah and Ed run away. Henry is nowhere to be found and they keep running. Jenny comes face to face with an infected Paula and she kills Paula by pushing her over the edge of the high walkway. They reach the engineer's office and start looking for the blueprints of the tunnel. The group is confronted by more infected and Henry reappears and kills them to save the group. George snoops in Henry's briefcase, discovering alarming documents relating to viruses, along with a vial and syringe. The others realize Henry has been bitten in the latest attack, and George confronts him with the evidence he found in Henry's briefcase. Henry admits to having been part of the terrorist cell at the apartment building, who have planned a worldwide plague. Ed attempts to grab Henry's gun and Henry shoots and kills him. While administering himself with the antidote, Henry elaborates that he is part of a bioterrorist group that believes the human population needs to be culled in a plague. Henry kidnaps George and plans to use him as a human shield, in case of attack. Jenny tries to stop Henry, but Henry hits her in the head with his gun. Shilah and Jenny get separated and Jenny encounters the infected Preston, but she manages to kill him. Shilah finds Jenny again, but has been bitten. As Jenny escapes, Shilah allows herself to be attacked by the infected to give Jenny a better chance of survival. Jenny finds George near the drainage tunnel. George tells Jenny that Henry's antidote has failed and that Henry is now infected and mutating into a rat-like humanoid. When Jenny climbs down to George, Henry attacks her. The night vision goggles fall on the ground in front of George. George puts them on, sees the gun, and shoots Henry, thus saving Jenny. Jenny and George  escape along a baggage tunnel as the terminal begins to burn down. When they are in the tunnel, George looks at Jenny and sees she has been bitten. She begs George to leave her behind. George refuses to go without her, and Jenny reluctantly agrees to follow. At the end of the tunnel, George squeezes through the bars to escape. George waits for Jenny and calls out to her. A savage and infected Jenny attacks George and grabs on to his hoodie, but George escapes by taking it off and leaving it behind. George reluctantly leaves the now infected Jenny trapped with the rest of the infected.

Ralph had been bitten by a hamster which is really a lab rat, brought onto the plane by Henry  for his school students. Ralph is restrained, but not before he bites the flight attendant Paula . The plane is forced to make an emergency landing in Las Vegas, and once it has landed, air traffic control refuses to let it approach the gate. Disobeying orders, Captain Forrest  and his co-pilot Willsy  find a jetway operated by a baggage handler Ed Ramirez . Almost everyone evacuates the plane, except for the elderly couple Bev Stevens  and her paralyzed mute husband Doc Stevens , and the pilots, who try to keep the violent Ralph contained in an aircraft bathroom. However, they learn that they have been locked out of the airport. Soon, armed soldiers and what appear to be CDC scientists surround the terminal. One of the passengers, a military medic named Shilah Washington , reveals she has a medical kit in her bag in the plane's cargo hold. The lead flight attendant Jenny , Henry, Ed, Nial Britz , and Preston  sneak back into the plane to retrieve it. They retrieve Shilah's kit and Nial's gun and they try to leave the hold. While in the plane, Jenny is attacked by an infected Captain Forrest and Nial shoots and kills him, but it seems that some of the captain's blood had gotten into Nial's eye. They also discover Ralph has escaped from the bathroom, whereabouts unknown. When they meet up with the rest of the group, they begin to realize that the infection is probably a form of rabies spread through bites. Doc is bitten by an infected rat and the group decide to lock him and Paula away to prevent further infection. George , an unaccompanied minor, accuses Henry of being responsible for the infection by bringing rats onto the plane. Jenny talks to Henry and asks if George's accusations are true. When Henry tells Jenny that George is just confused, they reconcile, and are then attacked by the escaped Ralph. With the help of Ed and Shilah, Jenny and Henry kill Ralph by strangling him. A team of four heavily-armed officers administer drugs to the group, and release the infected passengers from their confinement. Before she can receive the drugs, an elderly woman named Louise Treadwell, is bitten by her infected cat. Doc, also infected, bites one of the officials. After shooting Doc, the officers and one of the passengers attempt to evacuate but are shot and killed by personnel outside the doors. Ed drags one surviving officer back inside, and the group hides in a catering truck from the infected. When they reach the catering truck, the passengers realize Nial is infected, and he grabs and attacks his wife. The group question the wounded officer, who reveals that he does not represent the CDC but rather the Department of Homeland Security's anti-biological terrorism division called Chemical Biological Domestic Terrorism . He tells them about a quarantined building in Los Angeles that housed a bioterrorist group's lab and confirms that the drugs are experimental antidotes, which Shilah had strongly suspected. The wounded officer grabs Nial's gun from Henry and kills himself. While in the catering truck, Ed soon reveals that the building has an old drainage tunnel and he tries to give them details, but Ed is attacked by co-pilot Willsy from the roof of the truck. George pushes a button to raise the truck and Willsy is crushed to death. The survivors try to access an old drainage tunnel through which they can escape the airport. One of the passengers is attacked, and Jenny, George, Shilah and Ed run away. Henry is nowhere to be found and they keep running. Jenny comes face to face with an infected Paula and she kills Paula by pushing her over the edge of the high walkway. They reach the engineer's office and start looking for the blueprints of the tunnel. The group is confronted by more infected and Henry reappears and kills them to save the group. George snoops in Henry's briefcase, discovering alarming documents relating to viruses, along with a vial and syringe. The others realize Henry has been bitten in the latest attack, and George confronts him with the evidence he found in Henry's briefcase. Henry admits to having been part of the terrorist cell at the apartment building, who have planned a worldwide plague. Ed attempts to grab Henry's gun and Henry shoots and kills him. While administering himself with the antidote, Henry elaborates that he is part of a bioterrorist group that believes the human population needs to be culled in a plague. Henry kidnaps George and plans to use him as a human shield, in case of attack. Jenny tries to stop Henry, but Henry hits her in the head with his gun. Shilah and Jenny get separated and Jenny encounters the infected Preston, but she manages to kill him. Shilah finds Jenny again, but has been bitten. As Jenny escapes, Shilah allows herself to be attacked by the infected to give Jenny a better chance of survival. Jenny finds George near the drainage tunnel. George tells Jenny that Henry's antidote has failed and that Henry is now infected and mutating into a rat-like humanoid. When Jenny climbs down to George, Henry attacks her. The night vision goggles fall on the ground in front of George. George puts them on, sees the gun, and shoots Henry, thus saving Jenny.

The spokesman of the Holy See evades questions from the press and the curiosity of the outside world by reporting that the new pontiff felt the need to sequester himself in prayer and reflection before taking office, and by explaining that he will make his official appearance within a few hours. This does not happen. In accordance with the laws of the Church, until the pope appears before the people on the balcony, the ceremony of election is not over and no one in the conclave can have contact with the outside world. The College of Cardinals, deeply concerned by the crisis and the depression from which the new pope seems to be suffering, calls in the psychoanalyst Professor Brezzi. The cardinals react to the psychoanalyst with some suspicion, but still allow him to examine the new pope. Brezzi, in the presence of the cardinals, tries to initiate a psychotherapy session which, however, fails to reveal anything to explain the depression and helplessness that plague the pontiff. Brezzi reveals that his ex-wife is also a psychoanalyst and the newly elected pope is taken secretly to see her, but escapes his minders and runs away during a walk. Unaware of his absence, the cardinals kill time by playing games, ranging from cards to an international volleyball tournament organized by Brezzi. Vatican spokesman Marcin Rajski makes everyone believe that the Pope is in his quarters in prayer, and eventually the cardinals find Melville and give him another chance to announce his acceptance. However, when Melville comes out onto the balcony he declines his new position, claiming ""I am not the leader you need,"" and retreats back into St. Peter's."

His past catches up with him when he is ambushed in a parking lot and left for dead with 22 bullets in his body. Against all odds, he survives to take revenge on his killers. Former mafia boss Charlie Mattei is shot by an eight-man death squad in a car park, but survives the hit with severe injuries. On the hunt for the shooters, he finds himself confronted with his criminal past and resulting threat to his family. Mattei had left the business several years ago to his old friend Tony Zacchia. He had since lived a retired life spent with his family. He tries to identify those responsible without bloodshed. This ""weakness"" is, however, exploited, and his friend Karim is brutally murdered by the same people who had shot him. Mattei swears revenge and goes on a hunt for the masterminds of the attack. He visits the hit squad during a birthday celebration and announces that he will kill them one by one anytime, anywhere. Marie Goldman is the policewoman investigating the shooting in the parking lot. Her husband, who was also a policeman, was killed in the service but his killer was never caught. Despite the indifference of her superiors, she would like to clear up the murder of her husband. Towards the end of the movie, in order to get to Tony Zacchia, a desperate Mattei makes a deal with Goldman, who herself is divided between doing her duty and punishing the murderers of her husband who she suspects were Zacchia's men. The police get a USB stick containing data incriminating Zacchia in a money fraud and laundering operation. He finally confronts Tony Zacchia at his home and is about to kill him, but is interrupted by the police who end up arresting both Zacchia and Mattei. In the end, Mattei is released as the cops do not have enough evidence to charge him. Goldman had earlier in the movie revealed to Mattei that one of the 8 shooters had missed him on purpose in the shootout at the start of the movie. Mattei figures out that this 8th shooter was his friend and lawyer who had been forced by Zacchia into shooting Mattei. He is forgiven by Mattei and the movie ends with Mattei walking with his family on a beach. His voiceover tells the audience that he had left his past life behind him and all he wanted to do was spend whatever possible time he had left with his family. He also says that he will no more have to look over his shoulder as he is at peace with his past. As they walk away, he turns and looks over his shoulder which tells us that there is no getting away from his past for him, ever."

Despite his years of hard living, Thompson remains confident of winning but soon finds himself in trouble. Drawing on all his reserves he is able to knock his opponent down but not out. McGovern gets up and then knocks Thompson out for a ten count. Thompson still hopes to continue his career and regain his title, but a visit to the Doctor's informs him that the sight in one of his eyes has gone. He realises he will be unable to fight on and retires. His promoter explains that he spent most of his money during his career, and even a benefit held in his honour goes towards paying taxes. His wife, a glamorous nightclub singer, leaves him now that he can no longer provide expensive things for her. Thompson sinks into self-pity, returning to pubs in his old haunt in East London where he grew up to drink himself into an alcoholic stupor. One day, while drinking he encounters a former girlfriend from before his boxing career took off, Beryl. She is now the girl of a local big-shot gangster boss Joe Sleat. Sleat, who remembers Thompson as a young boy and was always jealous, is amused to see him in his current state and offers him a job working for him. Beryl tries to stop Thompson from being drawn into Sleat's orbit, but she is unsuccessful. Before long Thompson has become one of Sleat's best men, although he is treated contemptuously by the boss. Before long Beryl and Thompson are clearly developing feelings for each other irritating Sleat who feels that Thompson is getting above himself. He sets up an armed robbery on a jewellers and plans it so that Thompson will be killed in the raid. Beryl gets wind of this and intercepts the message telling Thompson about the raid, and then informs the police of Sleat's robbery. In the ensuing chaos, Sleat shoots a policeman dead and escapes. Now a fugitive he returns to his house where Beryl and Thompson are. She tries to tell Thompson not to get involved, but he still feels obliged to Sleat for giving him a break in his outfit. When the police arrive the three of them make a run for it and are pursued by the police through the streets of London's docklands. They finally hole up in a warehouse and Thompson and Sleat shoot down two more policemen. As Sleat gleefully points out to him, Thompson is now in as much trouble as he is. They all face hanging for their crime, and decide to fight it out. The situation rapidly develops into a siege. Sleat begins to break down, and eventually tries to make a run for it but is killed. Thompson and Beryl continue to hold out, but it has dawned on him there is literally no way back. Yet restored by Beryl's confession of her love for him and the sound of a nearby radio recounting the ongoing story of the siege and the career of the former champion ""Croucher"" Thompson - allowing him to briefly relive his glory days as a fighter - he accepts his fate and calmly walks outside to be shot down."

Sleat, who remembers Thompson as a young boy and was always jealous, is amused to see him in his current state and offers him a job working for him. Beryl tries to stop Thompson from being drawn into Sleat's orbit, but she is unsuccessful. Before long Thompson has become one of Sleat's best men, although he is treated contemptuously by the boss. Before long Beryl and Thompson are clearly developing feelings for each other irritating Sleat who feels that Thompson is getting above himself. He sets up an armed robbery on a jewellers and plans it so that Thompson will be killed in the raid. Beryl gets wind of this and intercepts the message telling Thompson about the raid, and then informs the police of Sleat's robbery. In the ensuing chaos, Sleat shoots a policeman dead and escapes. Now a fugitive he returns to his house where Beryl and Thompson are. She tries to tell Thompson not to get involved, but he still feels obliged to Sleat for giving him a break in his outfit. When the police arrive the three of them make a run for it and are pursued by the police through the streets of London's docklands. They finally hole up in a warehouse and Thompson and Sleat shoot down two more policemen. As Sleat gleefully points out to him, Thompson is now in as much trouble as he is. They all face hanging for their crime, and decide to fight it out. The situation rapidly develops into a siege. Sleat begins to break down, and eventually tries to make a run for it but is killed. Thompson and Beryl continue to hold out, but it has dawned on him there is literally no way back. Yet restored by Beryl's confession of her love for him and the sound of a nearby radio recounting the ongoing story of the siege and the career of the former champion ""Croucher"" Thompson - allowing him to briefly relive his glory days as a fighter - he accepts his fate and calmly walks outside to be shot down."

He sets out with his dog and searches for the source of this strange noise, then suddenly the dog is being dragged inside and brutally killed by an unknown beast creature. Then the ranger is also dragged inside and killed by the creature. Then the plot shifts to the 1970s where a college  farewell party is taking place. Two friends Amudhan and Vendhan , decide to stay back in the college hostel and spend the vacation there. This is mainly because Amudhan's Girlfriend Poongavanm lives in the nearby village of poomanandhipuram, so that he can't miss her during this vacation. The only thing that lies between the college and the village is the same corn field , that is believed to be the hunting ground of the strange creature, that the people now call Ambuli. Though some people called it a myth, many believed that ambuli did exist. One night, despite warnings from Vendhan, Amudhan decides to go through the corn field to reach poomanandhipuram to meet Poongavanam. He makes the first trip successfully, but while he returns, he hears the same strange noise and is been chased and thrown off his cycle by Ambuli . Amudhan runs for life and reaches the college, where he meets Vendhan and narrates him what happened and says to him that Ambuli is real. Vendhan is little convinced by Amudhan's narration and they both decide to visit the corn field together that night to see what really is happening. They both travel the entire field and reach one corner and find a wood house , and they meet Sengodan there. Sengodan guards the fields but his looks cause a little bit of suspicion to the boys that he might be the ambuli. But Sengoden does not harm them and the boys fled the place. The next day, they ask Vendhan's father  about Ambuli and also they enquire about Sengodan. Vendhan's father is very much angered by the news that they both travelled alone at night in the corn fields and cries to them saying that Death awaits whoever enters the field at night, as there lives a ferocious creature called Ambuli, that has killed so many people in the past and is still hungry for human life. He says that Vendhan is the only person he has got and if something happens to him he can't live. So he humbly requests them not to go there again. But still accepts to say about Ambuli and Sengodan. ""About some 40 years ago, on the day of Solar eclipse, a pregnant women who has no one except her elder child, walks into the village of poomanandhipuram but faints right under the sun . The villagers rescue her and she gives birth the very night. But the baby born was not exactly a human being. It was half human, half beast like a neanderthal. The beast baby bites the arm of the village doctor and it also attacks her mother fatally and escapes into the fields, and it has been till date killing humans. And Sengoden is none other than the elder brother of Ambuli and Sengoden is a murderer as he killed the founder of the college, and says that they are lucky not to be harmed by Sengoden"". This is the story said by Vendhan's father to Vendhan and Amudhan. Vendhan and Amudhan decide to collect more details about Ambuli and they visit many people in the village and enquire. They meet one of their seniors Marudhan, who is a practical youth who does not believe in Ambuli at all. But ironically, Marudhan's grandma is the village lady doctor, whose arm was bitten by ambuli at birth. They find a painting of ambuli from another senior, . With this painting as a proof, they try to make a complain in the police station, where the Head cop says, they need at least a photograph as a proof and not a painting. Vendhan and Amudhan accept the challenge and decides to visit the corn field to take a pic of Ambuli. But they are once again interrupted by Sengoden and they take a pic of him, thinking that he is Ambuli. As things went ths way, one night, Marudhan gets very curious about Ambuli, and decides to investigate things on his own. Thus he secretly follows a villager, who takes a full grown goat with him, and ties it to a small boat and sends into the lake that lies ahead of the old temple caves . Maruthan watches to boat shake and the goat is now gone. He understands that the villagers were paying sacrifice to ambuli to vent his anger. So the next day he decides to see what lies ahead of the lake. He goes in the same boat and enters the cave where he encounters the creature. Terrified, he runs for his life and escapes from that place. Now having started to believe in Ambuli, he enquires about it to his grandma. At the same time, Amudhan and Vendhan check for some details in the library about Ambuli. They enter the Founder's room  and find an Important Clue on his table. The Clue leads them to a key that leads them to the secret Projector room, which also turns out to be the chemical lab that has been locked for years. They Find some Projector reels and start watching them, as at the same time Maruthan's Grandma narrates what actually happened to Ambuli's mother and why Ambuli was born like a beast.What follows is some terrible truth that entire shocks Amudhan, Vendhan and Maruthan. The founder of the college , is basically a scientist, who worked with the British Army in the second world war. After retirement he begins the college in South India. His longtime goal is to successfully carry out and finish his project. That is to create humans who can live for 150 years healthily. He decides to use Sengodan's mother as his specimen and injects his chemicals into the womb. This starts having an impact on Ambuli. The scientist dopes her with strong sedatives so that she visits him often for checkup, so that he can carry out his test without any problem. As she reaches her pregnancy date, she is affected too much by the sedatives and starts walking to the scientist to get herself checked. That day turns out to be the Solar eclipse, and unfortunately she is affected by the radiation form the eclipse. This causes a big change in her womb and thus Ambuli is born, as a Beast. The Lady doctor who checked her pregnancy is terrified by the looks and behaviour of Ambuli and tells his mom to kill Ambuli right then. But she lets Ambuli escape and commits suicide. Angered by this, Sengoden kills the founder who is the reason for all this. Now Having collected all details about Ambuli, Amudhan, Vendhan and Maruthan decide that there is no use hiding from ambuli and they must fight against it. Or else they all will die of fear.

He sets out with his dog and searches for the source of this strange noise, then suddenly the dog is being dragged inside and brutally killed by an unknown beast creature. Then the ranger is also dragged inside and killed by the creature. Then the plot shifts to the 1970s where a college  farewell party is taking place. Two friends Amudhan and Vendhan , decide to stay back in the college hostel and spend the vacation there. This is mainly because Amudhan's Girlfriend Poongavanm lives in the nearby village of poomanandhipuram, so that he can't miss her during this vacation. The only thing that lies between the college and the village is the same corn field , that is believed to be the hunting ground of the strange creature, that the people now call Ambuli. Though some people called it a myth, many believed that ambuli did exist. One night, despite warnings from Vendhan, Amudhan decides to go through the corn field to reach poomanandhipuram to meet Poongavanam. He makes the first trip successfully, but while he returns, he hears the same strange noise and is been chased and thrown off his cycle by Ambuli . Amudhan runs for life and reaches the college, where he meets Vendhan and narrates him what happened and says to him that Ambuli is real. Vendhan is little convinced by Amudhan's narration and they both decide to visit the corn field together that night to see what really is happening. They both travel the entire field and reach one corner and find a wood house , and they meet Sengodan there. Sengodan guards the fields but his looks cause a little bit of suspicion to the boys that he might be the ambuli. But Sengoden does not harm them and the boys fled the place. The next day, they ask Vendhan's father  about Ambuli and also they enquire about Sengodan. Vendhan's father is very much angered by the news that they both travelled alone at night in the corn fields and cries to them saying that Death awaits whoever enters the field at night, as there lives a ferocious creature called Ambuli, that has killed so many people in the past and is still hungry for human life. He says that Vendhan is the only person he has got and if something happens to him he can't live. So he humbly requests them not to go there again. But still accepts to say about Ambuli and Sengodan. ""About some 40 years ago, on the day of Solar eclipse, a pregnant women who has no one except her elder child, walks into the village of poomanandhipuram but faints right under the sun . The villagers rescue her and she gives birth the very night. But the baby born was not exactly a human being. It was half human, half beast like a neanderthal. The beast baby bites the arm of the village doctor and it also attacks her mother fatally and escapes into the fields, and it has been till date killing humans. And Sengoden is none other than the elder brother of Ambuli and Sengoden is a murderer as he killed the founder of the college, and says that they are lucky not to be harmed by Sengoden"". This is the story said by Vendhan's father to Vendhan and Amudhan. Vendhan and Amudhan decide to collect more details about Ambuli and they visit many people in the village and enquire. They meet one of their seniors Marudhan, who is a practical youth who does not believe in Ambuli at all. But ironically, Marudhan's grandma is the village lady doctor, whose arm was bitten by ambuli at birth. They find a painting of ambuli from another senior, . With this painting as a proof, they try to make a complain in the police station, where the Head cop says, they need at least a photograph as a proof and not a painting. Vendhan and Amudhan accept the challenge and decides to visit the corn field to take a pic of Ambuli. But they are once again interrupted by Sengoden and they take a pic of him, thinking that he is Ambuli. As things went ths way, one night, Marudhan gets very curious about Ambuli, and decides to investigate things on his own. Thus he secretly follows a villager, who takes a full grown goat with him, and ties it to a small boat and sends into the lake that lies ahead of the old temple caves . Maruthan watches to boat shake and the goat is now gone. He understands that the villagers were paying sacrifice to ambuli to vent his anger. So the next day he decides to see what lies ahead of the lake. He goes in the same boat and enters the cave where he encounters the creature. Terrified, he runs for his life and escapes from that place. Now having started to believe in Ambuli, he enquires about it to his grandma. At the same time, Amudhan and Vendhan check for some details in the library about Ambuli. They enter the Founder's room  and find an Important Clue on his table. The Clue leads them to a key that leads them to the secret Projector room, which also turns out to be the chemical lab that has been locked for years. They Find some Projector reels and start watching them, as at the same time Maruthan's Grandma narrates what actually happened to Ambuli's mother and why Ambuli was born like a beast.What follows is some terrible truth that entire shocks Amudhan, Vendhan and Maruthan. The founder of the college , is basically a scientist, who worked with the British Army in the second world war. After retirement he begins the college in South India. His longtime goal is to successfully carry out and finish his project. That is to create humans who can live for 150 years healthily. He decides to use Sengodan's mother as his specimen and injects his chemicals into the womb. This starts having an impact on Ambuli. The scientist dopes her with strong sedatives so that she visits him often for checkup, so that he can carry out his test without any problem. As she reaches her pregnancy date, she is affected too much by the sedatives and starts walking to the scientist to get herself checked. That day turns out to be the Solar eclipse, and unfortunately she is affected by the radiation form the eclipse. This causes a big change in her womb and thus Ambuli is born, as a Beast. The Lady doctor who checked her pregnancy is terrified by the looks and behaviour of Ambuli and tells his mom to kill Ambuli right then. But she lets Ambuli escape and commits suicide. Angered by this, Sengoden kills the founder who is the reason for all this. Now Having collected all details about Ambuli, Amudhan, Vendhan and Maruthan decide that there is no use hiding from ambuli and they must fight against it. Or else they all will die of fear. So the village people gather as a strong mass and set to hunt Ambuli, headed by Maruthan. at the same time, Amudhan and venthan, along with their girlfriends, meet sengodan.

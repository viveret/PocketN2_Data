The doorbell rings, and she sees through the peephole that it is a young man, who later identifies himself as Sameer A. Purnavale , claiming to be an business partner of Mr. Malhotra and the house belongs to Mr Gupta. She is reluctant to open the door, even to talk to this stranger, as the police had just issued a warning about a killer at large in this area and denies that it is Malhotra house but Gupta's. She does offer him a sandwich, but he tricks her into opening the door, and lets himself in on the pretext of protecting her from an unknown person, who is making a noise elsewhere in the house. When no one is found, she asks him to leave, and opens the door, and finds another man with a gun, who later identifies himself as Police Inspector Qureshi . The two doubt his credentials, and Sameer phones the nearest police station and calls for help. The two men then get into a fight, and she gets hold of Qureshi's gun, and asks them to sit quietly. It is then revealed that the man claiming to be Inspector Qureshi is in fact a thief. She telephones her mother and ask her to contact the police. Purnavale tries to kill Qureshi, thinking that he is the serial killer and then uses the telephone to call the police, but finds that the phone is not working. He is unable to understand what is happening and asks Ma'am to hide somewhere safe inside the house. While trying to figure out a solution to the problem. There is ring at the door bell and Purnavale answers. He starts looking around for Miss Malhotra in the house and tells her that there was a man who was asking for Mr Malhotra and questions her this house is Gupta's and not Malhotra's as she had told him earlier to which she runs away to the top floor as she is scared of him without answering him. He starts looking for her for an answer to his question when he stumbles upon a dead body and identifies that the dead body is of Mr Malhotra. Purnavale panics when he looks around as she attacks him and in self defense he tries to kill her. In this confusion the thief who is mortally wounded stabs him to death assuming that he is the killer. When the thief checks on Purnavale's body Ms Malhotra starts singing like a psycho while she stabs him to his death and revealing that she is the killer.

Senior Sergeant Vaskov is stationed with a group of young female anti-aircraft gunners in a railway station far from the front line.

Thinking that they may sabotage military facilities, Vaskov and five of the women attempt to stop the Germans.

The film begins with him breaking into a Corsican girlfriends house; the girl, armed and voluptuous, believes Andrea a criminal and nearly shoots him before being seduced, but she later ends their relationship in the light of such an incident. Later, while spending an afternoon with an Asian air stewardess, he tries to achieve arousal by making up a situation about a dying relative, but the stewardess learns the sham and the liaison ends disastrously. Having had enough of his condition and the continuing problems it brings him, Andrea goes to a psychiatrist and pours out everything. He developed his problem in adulthood, but all his life he has flirted with woman and suffered from the consequences. The psychiatrist, while slightly unhinged due to long association with the deranged, sensibly recommends that Andrea try to seek out spiritual qualities in women rather than their physical attributes, and to attempt to connect with them emotionally. Andrea heads off to Switzerland, where he meets an Alpine girl. Following the doctors advice, he doesn't seduce her but charms her and takes her out on romantic dates. Things go well between them and Andrea, attracted by the girls sweetness, proposes marriage. Unfortunately, the night before their wedding, the couple visit a circus, where a beautiful lion tamer challenges anyone to kiss her in the middle of a group of lions. Andrea can't refuse such an offer, and gives the lion tamer the kiss of her life, bringing an effective close to his Swiss romance. Andrea next entangles with an American woman, the wife of a major who happens to be his superior. This potentially dangerous and passionate affair is blown quickly, and Andrea gets posted to Sicily, where he encounters a Sicilian girl from a fierce-tempered honorable family. The girls family accuses her of not being pure, and Andrea poses as a doctor in order to check on her, but in fact takes advantage of the dangerous opportunity to seduce her. The family catches him in the act and chase after him, and with much difficulty he escapes. Andrea now takes the only alternative he knows: he returns to his Italian hometown and to Gigliola, his first ever sweetheart, who still resides there. He had left Gigliola when he joined the army, and as a result she was heartbroken and lovelorn; however, she still loves him, and he hopes that her love will aid him in overcoming his problem. When she hears about Andreas condition and his attempts to cure it, she pledges to give herself to him if it will make him stop with other women. Andrea, however, cannot bear to seduce a woman he truly loves and instead spends the night with a pedicure who is reputed to bring ill fortune to her men. Andrea's next woman is a countess, whose husband is much older than she is and moreover suffers from deafness. She lures him into a plot to murder her husband: they will seat him under a heavy and delicately balanced stone ball atop a wall. At the slightest shock, the ball will fall on top of him. Aroused by such a dangerous venture, he consents . The count's deafness, however, is a sham, and having heard the plan, he tries to turn it upon Andrea: he adjusts the ball to become even more unsteady, and convinces Andrea to take his seat. But the seat itself breaks under Andrea's weight and while the count sets up a new one, Andrea accidentally slams a door and causes the ball to fall on the count. Andrea is put on trial for his supposed crime, which attracts wide publicity and interest.

However, this bicycle itself brings him face-to-face with Sharda, when he bumps into her by accident. Sharda's bicycle gets badly damaged & Ranjeet drops her off. Th same evening, Ranjeet goes to the wedding of his friend , a co-worker & a poet. Sharda is also present at the ceremony. Sharda & Ranjeet's love blossoms from there & soon they get married. In the course of a few years, Ranjeet is Sales Manager of the company and father of a son. Sharda & Ranjeet are still living in marital bliss. That is, until Nirmala, Ranjeet's new secretary, shows up. Ranjeet is inexplicably attracted to Nirmala. She is an honest girl who is trying to make two ends meet. She is much more beautiful compared to Sharda. But most of all, she knows nothing about Ranjeet's true intentions & his married life. Ranjeet is initially upset with his thoughts about her, but finally gives in. He carefully plans his further steps. He pretends to be the helpless grieving husband of a cancer stricken wife, who won't live much longer. Nirmala feels sorry for him, thus making it easier for him to get close to her. Nobody, not Sharda, not even his closest friend, suspects a thing. One day, Ranjeet bluffs to Sharda that he will be late coming home as he has a meeting. He takes Nirmala out to dinner. Next day, Sharda finds Nirmala's handkerchief, with lipstick marks on it, in Ranjeet's pocket. She immediately confronts Ranjeet, who makes up a story about a co-worker whose handkerchief he may have accidentally taken. Sharda reluctantly believes him. Ranjeet decides to take his next steps more carefully. Sharda too starts thinking that her fears were unfounded. Ranjeet makes even more interesting back up plans: He prepares two books of poetry, professing his love. The poems are the same in both, only one book contains Nirmala's name, and the other contains Sharda's. Ranjeet courts Nirmala without Sharda's knowledge. The turning point comes when Sharda sees him in a hotel with Nirmala. She later asks him about his meeting, about which the clueless Ranjeet lies. Sharda's fears are confirmed. She starts spying on him & Nirmala, taking incriminating pictures. After sufficient evidence is obtained, she secretly meets Nirmala, posing as a journalist. Nirmala, who hasn't seen Ranjeet's ""ailing wife"" yet, thinks Sharda intends to blackmail her. But Sharda reassures her that she won't. Nirmala spills all the beans, upon which Sharda reveals her true identity. Meanwhile, Ranjeet gets another promotion & rushes home happily to tell his wife about it. Sharda catches him unawares and lets him know that he is busted. Ranjeet does not know what has hit him. He turns round, only to see Nirmala behind him. Sharda tells him that she is leaving him & the divorce papers will be soon sent to him. Sharda & Nirmala console each other. Ranjeet calls upon his friend & lies that Nirmala has said some malicious lies to Sharda about him. Ranjeet's friend sides with him & lies about Nirmala's character. Sharda exposes Ranjeet in front of him as well, with help of the evidence she has collected. Sharda tells Ranjeet to choose either her or Nirmala. Ranjeet quietly gives Nirmala some money & lies to her, in a last-ditch attempt at damage control. But honest Nirmala returns the money to Sharda, making things even worse for Ranjeet. Sharda prepares to walk out on Ranjeet, while Nirmala resigns and leaves Ranjeet as well. Sharda comes to visit Ranjeet one last time, when their innocent son asks what is happening. Sharda decides to give Ranjeet another chance, if only for their son and soon life comes back on track. But soon another secretary joins the office & Ranjeet tries to resort to his antics once more. Just by coincidence, Ranjeet's friend suddenly walks in & Ranjeet backs off, taking this as a warning."

The Death Note's instructions claim that if a person's name is written within it while picturing that person's face, that person shall die. Light is initially skeptical of the notebook's authenticity, but after experimenting with it, he realizes that the Death Note is real. After meeting with the previous owner of the Death Note, a Shinigami named Ryuk, Light seeks to become ""god of the new world"" by passing his judgment on those he deems to be evil or who get in his way. After months of killing criminals, Light is dubbed Kira by the public and some believe him to be righteous about killing criminals. Interpol is no closer to catching him, and is going to pass the case on to the Ministry of Health as some disease, until L steps onto the scene. Known as the best detective in the world, L has solved many cases with his assistant Watari. Working with them, L manages to confront Light, live on TV, and deduces he is in the Kanto region of Japan and he can ""kill without lifting a finger."" The race begins between L and Light to discover each other's identity, and a game of cat and mouse ensues between the two geniuses. Later Misora kidnaps Shiori and asks Light to come to the art museum and confess that he really is Kira if he wants to save her. He goes to the museum, but denies that he is Kira, and begs for Shiori's release. Misora tells Light that unless he kills her using her real name, which was ""Naomi"" written in katakana, she would kill Shiori. Light adamantly insists that he is not Kira. Soichiro, upon seeing this, sends the police. Misora immediately becomes upset and distracted, allowing Light's girlfriend to break free and run away from her. Misora fires her gun and shoots Shiori, who dies in Light's arms shortly afterward, and then afterwards commits suicide by shooting herself. Later, Ryuk finds that Light had actually engineered Naomi's death using the Death Note, as he had already found out her name by checking with the church since she revealed to him she was Iwamatsu's fiancée and he reasoned that nobody would use a fake name in marriage and written a scenario whereby Misora would commit suicide after shooting Shiori. Obviously, Ryuk is confused, as by doing this, Light would end up killing Shiori, but Light reveals that he had written her name in the Death Note as well. Using these events to foster hatred for Kira, Light asks to join the investigation team when his father checked on him. While Soichiro is slightly reluctant, L immediately grants his wish and it is hinted that he is still certain that Light is Kira. As a prequel to the second movie, Misa, an actress, is chased down an alley by a man wielding a knife, intent on killing her. As she screams for help, the man dies of a heart attack just like Kira's victims. A second Death Note lands beside her.  The movie starts with Misa, a TV presenter, getting a 2nd Death Note. Later Misa, using her Shinigami eyes, kills Mogi and two policemen. Sayu was also almost killed until her father Soichiro crashed into the festival wearing a motorcycle helmet. Light kills Takada to regain ownership of his Death Note. Afterwards Light tricks Rem into killing L and Watari. After they both die, Rem dies for intentionally killing someone to help Misa. Misa then gives up her ownership of the notebook and loses her memory of it. Later it is revealed that L did not die and avoided death by writing his name in the notebook stating, ""L Lawliet will die 23 days from this date"". After proving that Light is Kira, Light pleads with Ryuk to kill L and the task force. Ryuk then agrees but writes Light's name in the Death Note, telling Light that anyone who uses the death note is banned from heaven and hell and will instead spend eternity as nothingness. Light dies in his father's arms begging him to believe he acted as Kira to carry out justice, which Soichiro had taught him since his childhood, into practice. Later Soichiro goes home and lies to his wife and daughter, saying that Light was killed by Kira. It ends 23 days later, with L dying peacefully."

The film opens in the La Fenice opera house in Venice with a performance of Il Trovatore. At the close of Manrico's rousing aria Di quella pira, the opera is interrupted by a major protest of Italian Nationalists against the occupying Austrian troops present in the theatre. Livia, an Italian Countess who is unhappily married to a stuffy old aristocrat, bears witness to this and tries to conceal the fact that her own cousin Marquis Roberto Ussoni organized the protest. During the commotion, she meets a dashing young Austrian Officer named Franz Mahler, and is instantly smitten by him. The two begin a secretive and highly forbidden love affair. Despite the obvious fact that Franz was responsible for sending Roberto into exile because of his radical behavior, Livia vainly pretends not to be aware of it. Although he is obviously using her for her money and social status, Livia throws herself into an affair of complete sexual abandon with Franz, giving away all her money and not caring what the high society thinks about her. But soon, Franz begins failing to show up for their trysts and Livia is slowly consumed with jealousy and paranoia. The war finally forces the lovers apart, with Livia's husband making her move away to their villa in the country in order to avoid the carnage. Late one night, Franz sneaks his way into Livia's bedroom, where he asks her for more money in order to bribe the army doctors to have him stay away from the battle field; Livia complies, giving away all of the money she was holding for Roberto, who intended to supply with it the partisans who were fighting the Austrians.  Livia's betrayal leads to tragic consequences; the Austrians overwhelm the under-equipped Italians. Eventually, Livia is almost driven mad by the fact that she is unable to see Franz and rejoices when a letter from him finally arrives. In it, he tells her how much he loves and misses her and that the money she gave him helped him stay away from the front. He advises Livia not to look for him, but she does not listen. As soon as possible, Livia, still grasping the letter, boards a carriage and hurries to Verona to find her lover, where she soon discovers what her indiscretion has caused, amidst the gloating Austrian soldiers. Once there, Livia makes her way to the apartment, which she herself had bought for Franz. But all she finds is a drunken, self-loathing rogue in the company of a prostitute, who openly mocks Livia for accepting his abuse. Franz brutally throws Livia out of his apartment, and she finds herself in streets full of drunk, sleazy soldiers. Livia realizes that she has Franz's letter. Nothing remains now but mutual self-destruction. Her sanity slipping, Livia heads to the headquarters of the Austrian Army, where she hands Franz's letter to a General, thereby convicting Franz of treason. Although the General sees that Livia is acting out of spite for being cuckolded, he is forced to comply and Franz is executed by firing squad. Livia, now insane, runs off into the night, crying out her lover's name.

The recovery of the sub results in a plot devised by Eric Lauffnauer, a U-boat officer during the war, to pull a daring million-dollar heist on the British ocean liner Queen Mary, which he and the others plan to rob on the high seas while the liner is making a transatlantic crossing. Brittain gets the sub in working order with the assistance of his own partner, Linc, and a new man, Moreno, a war hero and expert with engines. Disguised as officers from a British vessel on a top-secret mission, Brittain, Rossiter and Lauffnauer board the Queen Mary, where they seize the bullion in the cargo hold. The captain complies after the pirates threaten to open fire on the ship and its civilian passengers. Rossiter's greed leads to his being killed by a member of the Queen's crew. Brittain must abandon the money when Lauffnauer prepares to dive the sub without him. A U.S. Coast Guard cutter in the vicinity, played by the Miami, Florida-based USCGC Androscoggin, comes to the ocean liner's aid. Lauffnauer elects to fire the sub's torpedoes at it. When the others protest, he pulls a gun. Rosa tries to stop him and Lauffnauer accidentally shoots his friend, Moreno. The Coast Guard cutter destroys the torpedoes that Lauffnauer manages to fire from the U-boat. Brittain, Rosa and Linc dive off the sub, just before it is rammed by the Americans. They survive, paddling a raft, but their mission has resulted in three deaths and netted them nothing. NOTE: The USCGC Minnetonka is also listed in the film's final credits, since some of the scenes also used Minnetonka. At the time of filming, Minnetonka was homeported in Long Beach, California, close to Paramount's studio facilities in Hollywood.

Suddenly he hears Bugs Bunny in the distance, singing . Sam calls out to Bugs, who starts paddling towards the island. A high tide causes Bugs to fall into Sam's arms. Just as Bugs celebrates being on dry land, Sam tosses him in a stewing pot to cook. However, Bugs douses the flame with water from the pot. Sam then has to go back to his ship to get another match. The shark nearly gets Sam on his way to the ship, but Sam distracts the shark with a bone, goes back to the ship with one match and gets back to land. However, Bugs is not in the pot. When he checks the pot, the shark jumps out and starts eating Sam, but Sam manages to whack the shark with a mallet - soon whacking himself, when the shark jumps off. Bugs is on the ship itself, but Sam is determined to catch him. First, Sam tries to ride on a surfboard to the ship, but is almost swallowed by the shark. Next, Sam decides to outsmart both Bugs and the shark by tying a balloon around his waist and floating to the ship. When Sam floats down to the ship, Bugs opens a hatch that Sam floats into, with the shark waiting for him. Sam then manages to beat the shark back again. Sam catches Bugs again and throws him into the pot, lighting the fire again. However, Bugs tries to point out that a tidal wave is heading for the island. Before Sam can do anything, the tidal wave sweeps across the island, leaving Bugs safe in his pot, but the island gone. Sam, now being chased by Dopey Dick, swims to the pot, yelling for Bugs to pull him in. Bugs uses a pike pole to start pulling Sam in, but then tells Sam that he'll only keep him up if they make a deal. After a quick ""No deal!"" Sam eventually relents. The deal is that Bugs will keep Sam on the end of the pole to keep Sam above water, while Sam paddles. Sam looks back and sees the shark behind them and starts paddling faster, eventually going in the direction of San Francisco - which, according to a floating marker, is only 2,736 miles away."

Henry survives by inadvertently time traveling back two weeks earlier to the scene. Moments later, Henry is helped by an older version of himself, who has also traveled back. Unable to control the timing or destinations of his traveling, Henry finds himself drawn to significant people, places, and events in his life but is incapable of changing events beyond the minor differences his presence creates. In 1991, Henry meets Clare, who is overjoyed to see him although he is actually meeting her for the first time. Clare explains that she has known Henry for most of her life and that he is her best friend. They begin a relationship, which is challenged by Henry's disorder. His sporadic time traveling is further complicated by the fact that he is completely naked when he arrives at his destination, and from a young age he has learned how to pick locks and steal in order to acquire clothes and survive his travels. Among his getaways are many visits to young Clare; from present-day Clare's diary he gets a list of dates when he visited her, and gives those to young Clare so that she can be waiting for him with clothes. Falling in love, Henry and Clare eventually marry, though he actually time travels away before the ceremony and an older version of himself arrives in time to step in. Henry's disappearances take their toll on his relationship with Clare. His disorder allows him to win the lottery by having the numbers in advance, but also makes having a child with Clare seemingly impossible, as Henry's genes cause their unborn fetuses to time travel. After numerous such miscarriages, Henry has a secret vasectomy to end their suffering. Clare soon gets pregnant one last time — by a visiting younger version of Henry — and is able to carry the baby full term. Henry travels forward in time before the child is born and meets their daughter Alba as a preteen; she tells him that she is a time traveler, too, but has increasing control over when and where she travels. She also tells Henry that he will die when she is five, a fact that Henry keeps from Clare upon his return to the present. Young Alba is visited sporadically by her preteen self, who ultimately tries to prepare the younger girl for Henry's death. A devastated Clare soon finds out what is to come. Later, Henry time travels and is shot by Clare's father as he hunts; he returns in time to die in Clare's arms. A younger Henry later visits Alba and Clare, giving Clare hope that he will visit again, but he tells her not to spend her life waiting for him.

As word spreads, Archie's classmates, parents, the most beautiful girl in school, Sierra, and a ""Shady Bunch"" of teachers, shrinks, doctors, pill-pushers and counselors bombard him – some hoping to save him, some wanting to imitate him, others trying to push him over the edge. Archie films it all, pointing his incisive camera at the realities of life, death, violence, sex, money, drugs, music and media overload. Archie rants with comic accuracy, interweaving documentary footage with his narrative, graphically revealing what teens love and hate, do for kicks, and secretly hide within their souls. The same day he says he is going to kill himself on camera, he is taken away by the Police and brought to a mental hospital, where he repeatedly calls a psychiatrist a ""Cunt"" on camera, until the same psychiatrist tells him to go back to school and have teachers deal with him. The next day Sierra, the most popular and beautiful girl in school, confronts Archie about wanting to kill himself, along with many other students. He has always liked her but tells her off and leaves her standing alone. But Sierra won't give up and confronts Archie again, this time alone, asking if she could write a story about him for the school's newspaper, Archie agrees and both start filming. On the roof of the school they both go to, Sierra asks Archie why he would want to die and gets the answer that he's never really lived and hasn't gotten anything to live for, to which she replies that suicide is ""The permanent answer to a temporary problem"". Not surprised by this, Archie decides to hang out more with Sierra and include her in his plans. He visits her home and meets the parents, who tell him that their son, Shane, had a car accident last year and died, followed by that is a warning by the family to drive safely. In between the scenes Archibald is seen going to another psychiatrist, talking about life. They both develop a friendship and constantly quote movies. Also, in between David Carradine, Archie's inspiration, is seen giving interviews about death. One day Archie films Sierra jumping on his trampoline, her dress flies up and huge scars are seen on her legs, to which she says: ""It's just a rash"" and leaves the irritated Archie alone. The next day he decides to visit Sierra, welcomed by her mother who plans a charity event for her dead son, he asks to meet Sierra and talk to her. They both go to her room and she asks if she can trust him. When he says yes, she takes out a little box, with two razor blades and a piece of paper, a third razor blade is hidden in the paper. She pulls up her skirt, big cuts in her skin are revealed and takes the third razor blade to cut herself. Archie stops her from doing that, she accuses him of being a liar, saying she can trust him. He says she can, she then takes the razor blade and cuts Archie's chest. She tells him she wants to die as well and that they want to do it together, on camera. Archie agrees to that and so they make up a plan. They both film everything they do now. Archie is still a virgin, Sierra isn't and so she wants him to do a favour, she takes his virginity to not let him die a virgin. Later they go to a party and get really drunk, they also smoke pot and talk to other guests, who are at their school. Archibald goes out with the guys from his high school, talking nonsense. They find that they miss someone from their crew and one camera as well. The boy is found by them with the camera, coming out of a bush. The next morning Archie and his classmates have gym class and get ready in the locker room, Sierra filming the girls and Archie the boys. They go out of their locker rooms at the same time, the boys just stop and stare, whilst the girls start screaming and running away. The two gym class teachers are seen shocked and then the reason is revealed: The boy who had Archie's camera last night hangs from the basketball hoop, he has hanged himself there. In shock, Archibald films that, Sierra runs back in with the girls and the Police is called. Outside Archie is attacked by the dead boy's best friend, blaming him for getting his friend to commit suicide. Sierra thinks Archie's changed his mind about committing suicide with her because he is so shocked and gets mad at him. Archie declared that he still wants to die with her, but gets doubts. He gets in Sierra's car, she drives way too fast, screaming at Archie to look inside the glove box. He finds her box with the razor blades and the paper. She tells him to read the letter; it is from her brother Shane, who apparently died accidentally. It says that he can't live in this family any longer and that he will kill himself. Archie is shocked by the truth and now knows the real reason Sierra wants to die: her brother. They argue and Sierra kicks him out of her car, driving away. When he gets home, he finds his door open and his parents in his room, watching scenes from his undone movie about killing himself, they see Sierra cutting herself and them both talking about doing ""it"". Archibald asks them why they even got him, to which the parents firstly reply ""Because we love you"", but after a second time asking, they admit they only got him because his mother accidentally got pregnant, he was a mistake, but ""the best we ever made"". Still shocked, Archie doubts everything he has ever done and watches the footage on his camera. His friend who committed suicide is seen talking to the camera, about death, how nobody loves him and how he wants to end it all. Archibald gets into his car and drives to David Carradine's home, waits for him to get home and interviews him, whilst doing that he gets a phone call he doesn't answer. He tells him everything that's happened, to which Carradine replies: ""You really are fucked."" He then takes Archie out to the street and shows him homeless people, who still make others happy and give back. Archie sees that his problems can't be that bad and throws away his gun, with which he wanted to kill himself. He then looks at his phone to see who called him earlier, listening to a message on his mailbox, from Sierra who will kill herself now. Sierra is now seen on camera, talking about how she will take 60 pills to die and talking directly to Archie. Archibald immediately calls 9-1-1 to save Sierra and drives to her house, breaking a window to get it and finding her on the floor, knocked out. Thinking she's dead, he cries over her body. Sierra's parents come in and push Archie off, thinking it was his fault she is dying. A second later the ambulance comes in, trying to save her. The camera then switches to a funeral; high school friends and Archie are mourning over a grave. It is revealed that it is his friend's funeral, the one that killed himself in the gym. It turns out that Sierra could be rescued and they both don't want to die anymore. They later sit in Archie's room, listening to a message from David Carradine to Sierra. The camera slowly fades out as they kiss and Archie begins to say that the audience will probably think he and Sierra will now have a happy ending and a new beginning etc. etc. But no, Sierra finds a new boyfriend online and enjoys life while Archibald is still single, with his camera, but happy."

Both squads  are fierce rivals because each is the best on its respective coast; however, the Jets have beaten the Sharks at the annual Cheer Camp Championships for the previous three years in a row.

She deposits it to Rohit, which he safely locks in his safe. Since Rohit feels it’s not safe for her to wait at the platform he offers to drop her at his quarters, near by and she readily agrees to it. It’s so obvious that she’s running away from someone and Rohit feels she must have stolen the jewellery but she denies the accusation. She tells him that she inherited them from her mother but there are goons behind her because of it. And she’s escaping from them. He buys the story and assured that she’s safe and comfortable there, he goes back to the station.

Rohit immediately begins auditing the records and discovers that the entries are not correct and a huge sum of money has been missing.

A ferocious Tyrannosaurus Rex named Arnie charges on set and is about to devour a young doe named Barbara when suddenly, he removes his false teeth and lets the doe go out of sympathy. Gumby cuts the scene and questions Arnie on his hesitation to act ferocious. Although Arnie knows it is all just acting, he feels unfit for the part because it just isn't him. He explains that he once was a ferocious T-Rex, but thanks to the divine influence of George Pal, he has reformed and is now a vegetarian without a bad bone in his body. Gumby fails to understand the profound effect of George Pal on Arnie's persona, so Arnie and Pokey show Gumby a set of George Pal shorts to show him the significance of the artist, thus starting The Puppetoon Movie. A number of George Pal's short films are featured as part of the movie. These include The Little Broadcast, The Philips Broadcast of 1938, Hoola Boola and South Sea Sweethearts, The Sleeping Beauty, Tulips Shall Grow, Together in the Weather, John Henry and the Inky Poo, Philips Cavalcade, Jasper in a Jam, and Tubby the Tuba. After all the shorts, Gumby and the others meet other characters who George Pal animated, such as the Pillsbury Doughboy and the Alka-Seltzer mascot Speedy. Gumby then thanks George Pal for making all this possible, and everybody cheers. The screen pans out and shows a creature in silhouette with red eyes that looks similar to a gremlin, who looks at the audience, says ""George Pal!"", then climbs up a support beam while laughing hysterically. In addition to the film shorts listed above, the following Pal film shorts are also included in the 2000 DVD edition of The Puppetoon Movie: What Ho She Bumps, Mr. Strauss Takes a Walk, Olio for Jasper, Philips Cavalcade, Jasper's Derby, Hoola Boola, Ether Symphony, Aladdin and the Magic Lamp, The Magic Atlas, Jasper and the Haunted House, The Philips Broadcast of 1938, and The Ship of the Ether."

A narration explains the rigors of T'ai chi, and the effects it has on the individuals who learn it. When a person masters T'ai chi, their body becomes impregnable to any weapon. But a side effect of mastering T'ai chi is that the person’s hair turns white by age thirty, and their voices attain a high tone. One such T'ai chi master is the villainous Chief Chin  of the Chin Yin Chi clan. While students of the Lei Ping Kung Fu school go through an early morning training session, they witness two thugs from the Chin Yin Chi clan chase an old man and his daughter over the hill. The thugs start beating the helpless old man, much to the chagrin of his horrified daughter. The lead student, Ming Tu  interrupts the attack and warns the thugs to stop. Some other students get involved along with Ming Tu, and the thugs use some weapons on the students. Ming Tu manages to fight off the duo, but not before one of his fellow students is mortally wounded. The two thugs warn the students that the Chin Yin Chi clan will be back in force to kill them. Ming Tu escorts the old man and his daughter back to the Lei Ping school, where the wise master takes them under his protection. The two leaders of the Chin Yin Chi clan, Chief Chin and Chin Pa  show up at the Lei Ping school, demanding that the master hand over the old man. He refuses and one of his top pupils offers to go and fight for the schools honor. Despite his magnificent martial arts ability, he is no match against the Chin Yin Chi’s top dogs. Realizing the serious predicament they are in, the master himself goes to face the aggressors. Before doing so, he instructs his students to carry on the school’s name, and he selects Ming Tu as his successor, should he not survive the duel. The master and the Chin Yin Chi fighters engage in mortal combat, and soon the wise one is overpowered and killed. The old man, having taken an oath of peace, picks up a sword for the first time in twenty years and leaps into battle. His skills prove very admirable, but he too is taken down by the powerful duo. The students are horrified, and realize they cannot stand up to the invulnerable Chief Chin. The old man’s daughter is shattered. Ming Tu assumes leadership of the school and promises his students that the school will continue as the master intended, with him in charge. He also promises them that together they will take revenge against the Chin Yin Chi clan. Ming Tu comes up with a plan to take Chin Pa out of the equation, since he is not invulnerable like his cohort. So he walks into the Chin Yin Chi shrine and challenges the Chin Pa to a duel. Chin Pa’s weapon of choice is a loaded steel baton with a blade that wounds his opponents. Ming Tu falls victim to this weapon, but escapes from the shrine. This defeat only makes him more determined to beat Chin Pa. Ming Tu begins undergoing even more rigorous training to prepare for the next confrontation. He thinks up a way to counter Chin Pa’s baton—by covering his sword in oil so his opponent can’t get a grip on it. Sure enough, this works, and Ming Tu is finally able to kill Chin Pa. Chief Chin discovers the death of his comrade and goes looking for Ming Tu. Ming seeks additional training before he can face Chief Chin, but is forced into a confrontation with him. Ming cannot defeat the T'ai chi master, because he has no weak spot. Eventually, Chief Chin beats Ming unmercifully. The next senior pupil of the Wei Ping school, Sa Chien  takes charge since Ming Tu is out of action. He trains hard to beat Chief Chin, but when the inevitable confrontation takes place, Sa Chien cannot get the job done but barely escapes. The master’s daughter  meets an old nun who tells her how to find Chief Chin's weak point ""when he is not himself"". With the aid of the revenge-driven daughter, Sa Chien discovers that Chief Chin has one vulnerable spot after all, but getting him to expose it is near impossible unless he can get him to act other than ""himself""."

A narrator , present throughout the film, describes the two friends: Vicky is practical and traditional in her approach to love and commitment and is engaged to the reliable Doug . She is in Barcelona getting her masters in ""Catalan identity."" Cristina, on the other hand, imagines herself to be a nonconformist, spontaneous but unsure of what she wants from life or love. At an art exhibition, they catch a glimpse of the artist Juan Antonio Gonzalo . Cristina is intrigued by him at first sight, and grows curious when Judy and Mark tell the women that the artist has suffered a violent relationship with his ex-wife. Later that night, the women notice him across the room in a restaurant. He approaches their table to invite them to join him for the weekend in the city of Oviedo, in a small plane he flies himself, for sight-seeing, drinking wine, and sex. Cristina accepts the offer almost at once, but Vicky is unimpressed by his brazenness. She eventually decides to accompany her friend anyway, mainly to keep an eye on her and make sure that she doesn't get into trouble. At the end of their first day, Juan Antonio asks both women to come to his room. Vicky refuses, but Cristina agrees, though she falls ill before anything happens. For the remainder of the weekend, Vicky and Juan Antonio are together while Cristina recuperates. During their trip, he tells her about his former wife and muse, María Elena, and their tumultuous relationship. Vicky's opinion of Juan Antonio begins to change when he takes her to visit his father, an old poet. Late at night, they attend a Spanish guitar concert. Afterwards, Vicky finally succumbs to his advances on the way back home. The next day, Juan takes them back to Barcelona. Vicky, feeling guilty, does not mention the incident to Cristina, and the two begin to grow apart, Vicky throwing herself into her Catalan culture studies and Cristina taking up photography. Cristina quickly moves in with Juan Antonio. Meanwhile, Doug unexpectedly telephones Vicky, suggesting that they get married in Spain. She reluctantly agrees and he flies to meet her. One night, Cristina and Juan Antonio are awakened by a call, learning that Juan's ex-wife María Elena  has attempted to kill herself. Juan Antonio brings her to his house, and she moves into the guest room. Though initially María Elena mistrusts Cristina, she soon grows fond of her and her photography. Cristina soon realizes that the ex-spouses are still in love, and María Elena confides that their relationship was always loving but unstable because they were missing something, a mystery element. María Elena suggests that the missing link is, in fact, Cristina and the three become polyamorous. Cristina discloses the events of her life to Vicky, who appears secretly jealous of her friend's relationship with Juan Antonio, and to Doug, who disapproves. As the summer winds to a close, Vicky realizes she is unsatisfied in her married life and is still attracted to Juan Antonio. She learns that Judy is also unhappy in her marriage and confides in the older woman. Judy, who sees Vicky as a younger version of herself, decides to bring Juan Antonio and Vicky together. Vicky, however, believes that Judy, through Vicky, is ""trying to rewrite"" her own history. Meanwhile, Cristina becomes restless and announces she is leaving Juan Antonio and María Elena. María does not take the news well and breaks down. Cristina spends the last weeks of the summer in France. With their ""missing link"" gone, Juan Antonio and María Elena's relationship becomes abusive again, and María descends back into insanity. Attempting to pair up Juan Antonio and Vicky, Judy arranges for them both to be at a party. Juan Antonio begs Vicky to meet him the next day. After lying to Doug, Vicky goes to Juan's home for lunch, after which Juan tries to seduce her again. She is at the point of consenting when María Elena bursts in with a gun and begins firing wildly. As Juan Antonio tries to calm his sobbing ex-wife, he accidentally shoots Vicky in the hand. Vicky shouts at both of them, saying they are insane and she could never live like this, and leaves. When Cristina returns from France, Vicky confesses the entire story to her. Cristina says she never knew that Vicky felt that way about Juan Antonio, and she  wishes she could have helped her. Doug never learns what truly happened. As the three Americans return home, Vicky goes back to her married life and Cristina remains where she started, knowing only what she doesn't want."

Her love life falls apart as her boy friend doesn’t respond to any of her letters. In addition, her father becomes seriously ill. Her father’s office colleague, Ramanathan , becomes a great source of strength for her in these tough times. Soon, he asks for her hand in marriage. She accepts gratefully, and confesses that she had a boyfriend, who has seemingly forgotten her. However, she soon realizes the truth about Ramanathan. He is a sadistic and jealous husband, who tortures her no end and, not unsurprisingly, she opts for a divorce. As a divorced woman, with an infant in her hands, she lands in Chennai  to take up a new job and start a new life. Her life takes a turn for the better in Chennai as she has a very supportive friend-group in her office, particularly a widower, Janardhan . Janardhan, or Johnnie as he is popularly called, is a talented ventriloquist who “talks” through his puppet, Junior. He falls in love with Anu, but is unable to muster up the courage to tell her about it. In an interesting cinematic twist, her ex-husband’s mother discovers her presence in the city and takes up a job as a maid in her house.

Savitri’s brother Ramesh  has come from Singapore, and they all go to Ravi’s estate for a vacation. And that night starts Savitri’s terrible ordeal. An apparition is visible only to her eye; an eerie song and the sound of anklets make themselves heard only to her ears. And before she realizes what is happening, another spirit enters her body, driving out her own spirit! Overnight Savitri’s persona itself changes; she talks, walks and behaves like a different woman. Ramesh is puzzled at the change, and keeps a watch on her. He follows her, as she wanders all over the hills with the easy familiarity of a person who has lived there all her life. He sees her shed tears over two names carved on a tree trunk; the fading legends ""Radha"" and ""Ravi"" tell the tragic tale of love and loss. He follows her as he goes to a humble cottage and eavesdrops as she introduces herself to the incredulous old woman  as her dead daughter Radha. It was only due to her unrequited love that she was hovering as a banshee so far, she explains. She tells excitedly that in the 5 days before new moon, if she can…er..have physical union with Ravi even once, she would be alive again. And if she didn’t succeed? Well, she would push Ravi down the same waterfall where she had met her end, so that they could unite in the other world. In the old disused bungalow of Ravi, Ramesh sees a picture of Radha and listens to a cassette as well. He confronts Ravi with the photo, and Ravi tells all- how he fell in love with Radha , the daughter of the late factory supervisor. They roamed all over the hills, even as the lofty knolls were passive spectators to their love. With steadfast determination, Ravi manages to get his father’s  acceptance. But when he rushes back with the happy tidings, he finds only her body- she had met a watery grave trying to escape from the clutches of her evil suitor Ranga . Armed with the facts now, Ramesh thwarts off the attempts of the possessed Savitri’s attempts to sleep with Ravi. The first night she dresses provocatively and sings a song of seduction in the bedroom. Ramesh knocks the door and pulls Ravi out telling him that there was a call that the factory is on fire. And the second night, he dissolves some strong sedatives in Ravi’s glass of milk. The third morning, in the labour day gathering where they are special invitees, the transformed Savitri dances and sings with abandon. That night, she takes Ravi to their summer cottage, but her plan goes awry again when Ramesh sets it on fire. On the next night, Ravi is returning home when Ranga waylays him to settle old scores and hits him on the head. Ramesh rescues him in time. Of course, that night too passes without Radha’s schemes seeing success. The last night, its do or die for Radha, and so she puts the vigilant Ramesh to sleep and lures Ravi out with a soft song of invitation. Savitri’s displaced spirit crying out ‘Anna! Anna!’ and the barking dog wake up Ramesh and soon he is in pursuit as Radha sings and leads Ravi up the hill. In the end, good triumphs over evil."

Devu charges {{INR}} 30 to slice a finger, {{INR}} 300 to chop a hand, {{INR}} 3000 for the leg, and ten times as much to dispose off the whole body. On one of his nightly rounds, Devu is pursued by a cop and seeks refuge at a whorehouse run by a hooker Sarasu, played to perfection by Saritha. Despite her vehement protests, he stays put and leaves only at daybreak, but her persistent cough stays with him. At a theatre, Devu watches an advertisement for Glycodin Cough Syrup and proceeds to buy her a bottle. Devu and Sarasu bond over the cough syrup and philosophize late into the night, exchanging notes on their immoral lifestyles. Devu's assault on a trade union leader delivering medicine to a critically ill worker leads to a mishap. Watching the wailings of the widow of the worker, Devu is traumatized and breaks down at Sarasu's place. In an inspired moment, he suggests they remap their lives and chart a moral course. Sarasu is attracted by the notion of giving up prostitution and leading a normal life as Devu's wife, though she wonders if they'll be able to pull it off. The couple go to great lengths to secure a job for Devu and lead a normal life, but there are too many skeletons in the closet. Devu is no longer feared for his might, and Sarasu's past clientele continue to haunt the joint. Sarasu gets a loan for Devu from his evil brother Soma, who continues to harass her on that pretext. In a particularly traumatic sequence of events, Sarasu is raped by Soma as a helpless Devu watches, pinned down by Soma's henchmen. The couple resolve to repay Soma's loan, and Devu undertakes a botched robbery attempt. Devu is imprisoned and in his absence, Sarasu has an abortion. The couple's plans for normality never attain fruition. The inevitable return to lives of vice is especially tragic and heartbreaking. Devu's inherent goodness is contrasted with his ""evil twin"", a stepbrother Soma who thwarts his every attempt at morality and finally succumbs at Devu's hands. Kamalhaasan has an interesting cameo as a Hindi speaking client of Sarasu. Balachander skewers middle-class morality and takes potshots at the hypocrisy of do-gooders. In the final analysis, the film is an indictment of society at large, for not allowing lesser mortals to rejoin society and return to a life of normality."

The central character is a woman, played by Sripriya. Raised in a dysfunctional family with a wimp of a father and a philandering mother, she hurtles from one disastrous affair to another. As the movie begins, she has denegerated into a cynical, man-hating 'modern' woman. Into her life enter two radically different men. One of them is her boss , who owns the advertising agency that she works for. He is a prototype of the successful man - money-minded, opinionated, arrogant and a male chauvinist. In sharp contrast, Kamal Hassan, who has come to Chennai from Coimbatore to make a documentary on women, is an early version of the metrosexual male. Sensitive and sincere, he believes his job has a purpose and is both shocked and amused at the cynical attitudes of the other two. As the movie begins, Sripriya has been drafted by Rajnikanth to assist Kamal Hassan in his documentary. As Kamal and Sripriya start working together, Kamal starts understanding the complex personality of Sripriya. He recounts these over his whiskey-and-cigarette conversations with Rajnikanth, as the latter keeps warning him to not get too involved with such women. As he states famously, ""Women should be enjoyed, not analysed"". Inevitably, Kamal Hassan falls for Sripriya. But Sripriya incurs the wrath of Rajnikanth. Just when it seems that she is about to lose her job, she seems to have a change of heart and starts courting Rajnikanth. Kamal Hassan is devastated to see that she has turned out to be just the sort of woman that Rajnikanth said she was - opportunistic, money-minded and fickle.

He grew up in Barcelona during the 1950s, dreaming of leaving his poverty behind. During his youth in the 1970s, he meets his future wife. He was in a photograph exhibit, when just coincidence involved him with a group who was organizing a hunger strike for four days. There, he meets Norma Valenti, the only daughter of a wealthy family of traditional Catalan background. In spite of big economical, social and cultural differences between them, Juan and Norma get married. Norma works for the department of linguistics of Catalonia while Juan or Joan, his Catalan name, is overwhelmed by the social position acquired through the marriage. There is little use in Marés’ new life for his skills as ventriloquist or accordion player. After five years, the marriage starts to fall apart, when Norma’s real character comes to the surface. The beautiful Norma is a proud, cold woman with dark sexual tendencies. She has a special attraction for low class men who are “charnegos” . Norma also has a particular fetish with shoes, the men she sleeps with have to hold a shoe with the sole force of their erection. Juan returns home one evening, earlier than expected. He finds his unfaithful wife having sex with a shoe shiner charnego. Face with proof of her infidelity, Norma, tired of her husband, just leaves him for good. Juan keeps the apartment he used to share with his wife but without her support he is reduced to scratch a living from the streets playing the accordion and begging for money in las Ramblas. While performing on the streets, he is caught in the middle of a confrontation between a pro-Catalan language group and a Spanish right wing extremists. Juan plays the anthem of Catalonia which makes him a target of the extremists who throw a Molotov cocktail at him, burning him. Horribly disfigured in the explosion, Juan Marés falls deeper into indigence and schizophrenic hallucinations. His personality is transformed by his misfortune. He is obsessed with the happiness he has lost and with the memory of his wife. He encounters Norma a couple of times, first while he is performing on the streets, but she does not recognize him in his new painful condition. Marés talks to her again during the carnival in Barcelona, under the disguise of the invisible man; only at the end of their small talk, he gives her a clue about his identity. Another day he calls her up at work pretending to need help in the translation of many words from Spanish to Catalan. His hallucinations increase and a new identity starts to take shape in his mind: the emphatically non-Catalan Juan Faneca. Faneca has a strong, deep Murcian accent, a pencil mustache, sharp sideburns and eye patch. He is a charnego from Murcia and childhood friend of Marés, coming back to Barcelona after years living as a worker in Germany. Juan Marés, now under the disguise of Juan Faneca, tries first his new identity with his lonely neighbor, Griselda, whom he seduces starting an affair. Later with the excuse of looking for Juan Marés, Faneca gets closer to Norma and his dream is fulfilled. They have a one night stand. By then the seductiveness of the happier personality of Juan Faneca has completely taken over Marés, who is no more. A future with Griselda awaits now Faneca.

It tells the story of four middle-aged friends in Florence who organize together idle pranks  in a continuous attempt to prolong childhood during their adult life.  Count Mascetti  is an impoverished noble who has no means to support his family, but does not renounce high living pleasures anyway, and has an underage mistress, Titti . Perozzi  is an easy-living journalist harassed by the unceasing disapproval of his wife and his son. Melandri  is a communal architect whose main goal is to find the ideal woman. Necchi  is the owner of a café and pool hall where the friends usually plan their zingarate. During the movie they are joined by a renowned, military-like surgeon, Sassaroli , in whose clinic they recover after being hospitalized, injured after a mismanaged zingarata. Melandri falls in love with Sassaroli's wife, exclaiming ""I've seen the Madonna!"", only to discover she has psychological problems. The plot is mostly composed of elaborate practical jokes organized by the friends, including the creation of a fake mafia mob in whose ""criminal acts"" they involve a pensioner, Righi , who used to snatch croissants from the cake tray in Necchi's café, and Mascetti's attempts to save his marriage despite his relationship with Titti. The film ends with Perozzi's death, which still does not deprive the friends of their desecrating hijinks, not even in face of their own mortality; perozzi himself makes a last joke to the priest. When Perozzi's wife, criticized by Melandri for her lack of tears, comments: ""One can weep if somebody dies. But here nobody has died"", Mascetti replies: ""Well, in reality he had never been so much, but I liked him."" During the funeral procession they ""homage"" their dead friend by telling the wide-eyed Righi that Perozzi was killed for being a traitor to the mafia."

Manchurian General Che Kang  is a clever Warlord who capitalizes on the naïveté of Fong Sai Yuk. Neither man realizes that they fight for the Shaolin cause, and General Che Kang tricks Fong Sai Yuk into believing that Hung Si Kuan is a renegade bandit. With the help of the General’s henchmen, Fong Sai Yuk defeats a bloodied Hung Si Kuan. Then the tough rebel is put into shackles inside the General’s castle. Word quickly spreads that Fong Sai Yuk beat the unbeatable Shaolin hero, and the local faction of the rebellion attacks the unknowing Fong Sai Yuk for his rash actions. When the rebel leader reveals the true nature of Hung Si Kuan, Fong Sai Yuk is beside himself. The naïve martial artist initially intends to correct his mistake by sneaking into the General’s dungeon and liberating his cohort from the grasp of the Manchurians. However, General Che Kang himself is a powerful Kung Fu practitioner who foils Fong Sai Yuk’s plans. Once Fong Sai Yuk joins his Rebel brothers, they devise a plan to tunnel into the underground prison and rescue Hung Si Kuan. After several tenuous attempts at freeing him, the Shaolin heroes succeed in their task. Now reunited, Fong Sai Yuk, Hung Si Kuan, and their Rebel brothers must endure the assault of General Che Kang and his Manchurian army.

Wade is a notorious womanizer, who lives with his beautiful wife Hannah who scorns him. She has raised their son Theron to be dependent upon her, but as he reaches adulthood Theron seeks his father’s help in becoming a man. Wade initiates Theron in hunting and other masculine pursuits under the watchful eye of Rafe, Hunnicutt's loyal employee. Theron admires the slightly older and more worldly Rafe, and rapidly develops into a marksman and skilled hunter; he also learns about women from Rafe. Theron's new lifestyle leads him into a love affair with Libby, a local girl from a proper family, but her father’s animosity forces a secret relationship. Theron learns from his mother that the reason for Libby’s fathers scorn is Wades reputation as a womanizer. In this conversation he learns things about his parents that were previously hidden from him, including that Rafe is his illegitimate half-brother. We learn that Rafe’s mother is the root of Hannah’s anger at Wade, although the affair and Rafe’s birth preceded Hannah, and that Wade became unfaithful to her after Hannah turned him out. While Wade respects Rafe, his position is staunch that a bastard is not to be included or acknowledged. Theron becomes disturbed by his parents' dysfunctional relationship and his father’s treatment of Rafe. A disillusioned Theron rejects both his parents along with the concept of family, and thus Libby, his true love. Unbeknownst to Theron Libby is pregnant, but she does not want this to be the reason for their marriage. However, a confused and despondent Libby turns to Rafe, who out of passion and compassion agrees to marry her. This devastates Theron who then realized his error. All seems resolved until Libby's father overhears gossip that his daughter was impregnated by Captain Hunnicutt, and goes into a rage. We then see Wade and Hannah reconcile, at home, after seventeen years. After Hannah leave the room, Wade is then shot down by an unknown murderer who escapes. Theron tracks down his father's killer and sees he is Libby’s father. Theron kills the father in self-defense and soon after Rafe catches up. Though Rafe objects, Theron decides to leave town never to return. In the end, several months later, Rafe encounters Hannah at Wade’s grave. He offers to include her in the life of her grandson, and she shows him that she has acknowledged him as Wade’s son on the headstone.

When two million taels are stolen from the royal vaults, Ling is hired to find the thieves within ten days and administer his own justice.

Within weeks, he was a Marielito himself, headed with the rest of his family for a new life in Miami. Now a U.S.-based filmmaker, Zaldívar recounts the strange twist of fate that took him across one of the world's most treacherous stretches of water in 90 Miles.  As related by Zaldívar in the intensely personal and evocative film, arrival in South Florida is only the beginning of the family's struggle to comprehend the full meaning of their passage into exile. What follows is an intimate and uneasy accounting of the historical forces that have split the Cuban national family in two, and which shape the passage of values from one generation to the next.  90 Miles was filmed over five years, as the filmmaker returned to Cuba in 1998 to visit his hometown of Holguín, and again in 1999 as a guest of the Havana Film Festival. Using news clips, family photos and home movies, the film creates a portrait of recent Cuban history, as dramatized by one family's aspirations and disappointments. Zaldívar's is a tale rich in crossed borders, crossed loyalties and cross-cultural ferment. In the early 1980s, during the Mariel boatlift, he was not just a child of the Cuban Revolution, but a highly promising one. He had done very well in Cuba's free education system, receiving a scholarship to study film and television at a government boarding school. As such, he was an enthusiastic supporter of the Castro regime, and happy to join in the regime's efforts to publicly humiliate some of the thousands of Cubans who were leaving in the boatlift, labeling them gusanos .  One of Zaldívar's uncles who had fled to the U.S. in the 1960s offered to arrange the family's boatlift to Florida — on the condition that all or none of the family go. The family was reluctant to interrupt the lives of their children — Zaldívar and his two sisters — if the siblings were not willing. While Zaldívar's older sister was happy in Cuba, she was much less politically inclined than Zaldívar and more willing to follow her family into exile. So the decision fell, for all practical purposes, on Zaldívar.  Faced with the sudden possibility of leaving the country, Zaldívar's family revealed to him, for the first time, their ongoing disillusionment with the Cuban Revolution. Out of this difference of opinion, innocuous enough in Cuba, grew a cruel dilemma for the child. In the end, unable to deny his family the opportunity to start anew in Florida and deciding to place blind trust in his parents, Zaldívar agreed to go.  In the United States, though homesick and nostalgic for his homeland and surprised both by what he liked and disliked about North American life, Zaldívar resumed learning and growing with the headstrong adaptability so often demonstrated by youth. He continued his media studies, moved to New York, became a filmmaker and came out as a gay man. Similarly, his two sisters made happy lives, marrying and having children.  Interestingly, it is the older generation, which had most wanted to come to Florida, that experienced the greater problems. Zaldívar's father, especially, grew depressed and remote from his son after arriving. The father's dream of building his own home in Cuba, derailed by the Revolution, seemed to lose its power in the United States, where many Cuban men find themselves working jobs well below their professional level. Feeling betrayed by the Cuban Revolution and defeated by the 'American Dream,' Zaldívar's father withdrew into himself. Where Zaldívar's revolutionary zeal in the home country had created a divide of silence between father and son, in the U.S., the father's sense of failure and futility only widened the gap.  90 Miles is the account of Zaldívar's quest to piece together the twists — and consequences — of his family's journey into exile. Above all, it is a search for understanding and healing between father and son, by uncovering the emotional distance opened up by just 90 miles of water between Cuba and the U.S. mainland."

He has earned his high rank by using his Lohan Fist techniques to destroy the Ming rebels, who, in turn have targeted Prince Tsoi for assassination. Enter Shao Hai , a naive kung fu scholar who earns a living by acting as a janitor for the local Shaolin Temple. The monks here apparently don't take their positions too seriously, as they spend their days bullying Shao Hai instead of praying or practicing the martial arts. Shao Hai lives with his Aunt who adopted him, and learns the martial arts from his drunken master Uncle , formerly a head monk of the local temple. The day Prince Tsoi comes to the temple, Shao Hai watches the arrival from the roofs above. He sees incognito rebel assassins about to attack Prince Tsoi, and yells out to the Prince to take cover. Upon hearing Shao Hoi's warning, the guards leap into action and chase off the rebel offenders. Prince Tsoi then shows his gratitude towards Shao Hai for potentially saving his life. Prince Tsoi  allows the young man to think he has gained favor with the Ching. So this immediately goes to the head of Shao Hai and he goes around alienating those around him. Meanwhile, Shao Hai's Uncle asks him to spy on Prince Tsoi to determine which form of martial arts he practices. When Shao Hai informs his Uncle that the Prince practices Lohan style, he convinces Shao Hai to ask Prince Tsoi to teach him this super secret form of kung fu. The Prince is suspicious of Shao Hai's desire to learn Lohan Fist, but agrees because he sees the kid as a pawn of the rebels. In short time, Shao Hai learns Lohan and Buddhist Fist techniques. He finally gets to apply these skills when masked rebel assassins penetrate the palace security to kill the Prince. He beats off the assassins, and manages to kill one. When he removes the mask of the dead rebel, Shao Hai goes into shock when the assassin is none other than his Aunt who adopted him. Shao Hai now realizes that he is on the wrong side of this conflict. He goes to seek the advice of his Uncle, who recruits him into the rebellion, something that his Aunt firmly believed in. The Prince’s advisors warn him that someday Shao Hai could become a potentially great opponent with Lohan Fist training. But the Prince still plans to use Shao Hai to expose the underground. Over time, Shao Hai becomes more knowledgeable with the Lohan techniques, and begins to train his Uncle. The Prince finally catches on about whom Shao Hai is, and demands he send his Uncle to the palace to face him. After the two fight to a standstill, the Prince’s guards interrupt the fight, giving the Uncle the opportunity to escape. The angered Prince Tsoi organizes a search party to track down and kill Shao Hai and his Uncle. Meanwhile, both men have hidden themselves in the forest where Uncle begins training his nephew in the ways of the Buddhist’s Palm; the only know method of counteracting the Lohan Fist. After undergoing training of the Five Elements Buddha's Palm techniques, the enlightened Shao Hai returns to the palace to challenge his opponent. He fights through Prince Tsoi’s bodyguards to finally engage the Prince himself. Shao Hai must defeat the Prince not only to avenge his Aunt’s death, but in the name of freedom itself...

She begins to offer sexual services to customers in exchange for money. As she explores her sexuality, she discovers within herself an attraction towards semi-rough sex. One of her customers, Gary Jensen, beats her during their first encounter. When he returns to apologize, she accepts and begins to see him again. When one of Leila's other customers gets too rough, Leila flees to Gary's room to seek his consolation and protection. His gentle treatment of her encourages her growing trust in him. Leila's only confidant, outside of Gary, is a little girl that plays around the inn. The girl lives in an unhappy home, where her parents fight constantly. One day, the girl's Uncle Andy takes the child and her mother Bonnie on a roadtrip. In the midst of this trip, the little girl discovers that her mother and her Uncle Andy are having an affair. Meanwhile, Leila has grown very close to Gary, who begins to represent an escape from her passionless marriage and dead-end job. She stops charging him for sex. Despite momentary misgivings about his intentions, his passion convinces her to turn away from her life. She steals the money from the inn, and gives it to Gary, along with her savings acquired through her sexual services of the inn's clients. Together, they drive away in his car to his cabin in the woods. Once there, she is informed by one of Gary's friends that he is a pimp, and that his intention is to sell her services to his friends. Trapped, with no money or means of transportation, she is raped and beaten by a group of men invited by Gary. In the midst of her trauma, her mind turns back to the day in her childhood when her Uncle Andy had taken Leila's mother Bonnie out on a roadtrip and killed Bonnie in a fit of jealousy, right in front of the child Leila. It is thus revealed that Leila 'is' the little girl to whom she had been talking throughout the film. The little girl's broken home life holds the key to Leila's grown-up sexuality. After Leila is raped, one of the men takes pity on her and helps her to escape Gary's cabin. Gary and the men form a search party and comb the woods to find her. The little girl, Leila's child self, appears to Leila to inform her that Gary intends to kill her and that she must fight for her survival. When Gary finds Leila, he is distracted by the distant screaming of the little girl that he can't see, and Leila takes the opportunity to run off and flee to safety in the arms of her friend and co-worker Millie, who had been searching the woods for her, as well. Thus Leila turns her back on Gary and acknowledges the previously-suppressed memories of her past.

They meet the three survivors of a mysterious bloodbath; the young Stephanie , the coke-addicted Bobbi , and the foul-mouthed Police Officer Bennett . Hallaway watches the trio's respective interviews with Captain Billings  and Officers Wright  and Degrasso , where they tell the story of what brought them there: Officer Bennett and his partner Officer Conrad , hidden from view, fire the tires out from speeders along a road, convince the drivers their tires blew out as a result of their speeding, and threaten the drivers afterwards. Stephanie was traveling on vacation with her family, sees a car with blood on it and tells it to her oblivious mother . Bobbi was getting drugs with her boyfriend Johnny , and all learn that a pair of killers are responsible for the murders and disappearance. Stephanie's father Steven  speeds and their car's wheel is shot out by Officer Bennett. Bobbi and Johnny are about to offer help, but the Officers arrive and harass all of them, making Steven put Conrad's gun in his mouth and making Bobbi swear at Johnny. In the midst of this, Stephanie tells both men about the bloody car she saw earlier. Eventually the officers leave. Steven gets to work changing their tire, and Bobbi gets out to talk with Stephanie's family, who all feel violated by the officers. Simultaneously Bennett and Conrad see the car Stephanie described further down the road, and race back. A large white van speeds into the back of Jimmy's car, killing him and Steven. A dead man is at the wheel and a live person is sitting in the passenger seat of the van, who Bobbi tries to save. Bennett and Conrad arrive back at the scene. In the chaos Officer Conrad is killed and persons emerge from the van wearing rubber masks and kill the rest of Stephanie's family. Presently, Hallaway and Anderson are trying to figure things out when bodies are discovered in a motel nearby. Anderson takes Wright and Degrasso to the coroner's office, leaving Hallaway with Bobbi, Billings, Bennet, and Stephanie, who whispers something in his ear after Anderson leaves. Hallaway talks with the three others, while Degrasso stumbles upon nude pictures of Anderson and Hallaway. Leafing through them in Anderson's backseat, Degrasso is shocked to see the Agents with the body of a dead woman. Anderson stops the car and shoots both of them. Hallaway, meanwhile, reveals that he was at the bloodbath earlier, and reveals he and Anderson are in fact the killers. Hallaway shoots Billings, and when Anderson returns Bennett and Bobbi are also murdered. Driving away, it's revealed that the bodies of the missing woman and two others are found at the motel, the latter presumably being the two real FBI Agents.

After Christine confronts Jones with physical discrepancies between ""Walter"" and her son, Jones arranges for a medical doctor to visit her. He tells Christine that ""Walter"" is shorter than before his disappearance because trauma has shrunk his spine, and that the person who took Walter had him circumcised. Briegleb tells Christine it was planted by police to discredit her. Walter's teacher and dentist give Christine signed letters confirming ""Walter"" is an impostor.

Jones tells Briegleb that Christine is in protective custody following a mental breakdown. Jones orders Clark's deportation, but Ybarra makes Clark reveal the murder site. Briegleb secures Christine's release by showing Steele a newspaper story about the Wineville killings that names Walter as a possible victim.

One of his friends tries to shoot the swan, but just before his arrow flies, the friend is turned to stone. Siegfried's other friend accuses the swan of practising witchcraft, neither of them pondering the presence of a very wicked-looking owl just behind them. Siegfried is unable to stop thinking about the swan, and decides to follow it as it swims away from its spot on the lake. Siegfried soon finds himself at a tower-like castle. Sigfried watches in surprise and amazement as the swan transforms into a beautiful girl. He approaches her - at first she is frightened for him and tries to get him to leave, but at his persistence she starts to tell him her story. Her name is Princess Odette, and three years prior she was kidnapped by the evil wizard Rothbart  who wanted her hand in marriage. He keeps her a swan by day so that no one will fall in love with her, as the only way Rothbart's power can be defeated is when a man loves her with all his heart and soul. Siegfried explains that he already felt something for her the moment he saw her eyes, and asks her to go to his birthday ball the next night, where he will choose her as his bride. Although at first she refuses, Sigfried is intent and won't take no for an answer. But he convinces her and when she returns to her cage-like room she daydreams of him. The entire story is being seen through the eyes of two squirrels who are watching them. Enter Rothbart. His daughter Odille tells him about Siegfried, and Rothbart goes to Odette to tell her to forget about the prince and consider marrying him. She rejects. Turns out she's been in love with Siegfried for the past three years. Of course Rothbart is not going to let Odette go to the ball, so he bars the door and lifts the drawbridge to her cage-home. He and his daughter then plot to get Odette to forget Siegfried by getting him to fall in love with someone else - Odille. Odille, in the guise of Odette, goes to the ball and wows Siegfried with her dancing. Sigfriend does feel that there's something wrong but can't quite put his finger on what it is. Meanwhile, Odette manages to escape from Rothbart's castle with the help of the squirrels and runs to Siegfried's castle. But just as Odette is about to storm into the ballroom, Rothbart  grabs her, holds her mouth shut and brings her closer where she is able to watch but not make a sound. Thus she watches in horror as Siegfried pledges his love to Odille and announces her as his wife-to-be. Overcome with sorrow, Odette faints into Rothbart's arms. Rothbarts laughter gets Siegfried's attention and the prince quickly realises his mistake. Odille reveals her true form and the three of them transform into their winged shapes and fly back to the castle.

He replies by telling them that the lighthouse is older than he himself and tells him a story about it. The story is about a young girl named Andrea and her older brother Jason whose parents work in a sugar cane field of a family called the De Veras. One day, Andrea finds a dirty boy hiding out in their truck. She screams for help and her father comes along, pities the boy and takes him in as his own son. As the years go by and the children get older, Andrea and the boy, Daniel  grow very fond of each other while Jason becomes jealous of Daniel because of how much attention he has gotten from his family. One day Jason and Daniel got into a fight when their parents weren't home and Jason beat him up and told him that he'd be sleeping outside that night. Andrea goes out to comfort Daniel and the two imply that they love each other, despite their young age. The two play together and pretend to get married: Andrea is the bride, Daniel the groom and the De Vera's daughter, Monique, is the bridesmaid. Monique complains that she is always the bridesmaid and now she wants to have her turn at marrying Daniel. One day, Andrea's parents have news that they're moving into the hacienda behind the De Vera mansion and Jason, disappointed that he won't actually be living in the big house, runs away swearing to one day get rid of Daniel for good. Now Andrea and Daniel are in their early twenties and one fateful day, Andrea's parents get into a car accident and die. Jason secretly comes back for his parents funeral and afterwards, he shows up at the hacienda and tells Daniel and Andrea that he is the head of the household and kicks Daniel out. The De Vera's children, Antonio (aka Anton, and Monique, come back from studying abroad and their mother throws them a welcome home party. After hearing that Monique has returned, Andrea and Daniel go to check it out even though they weren't invited. Andrea had a scheme to get a glimpse of the party but she was unable to see anything when she got bitten by one of the guard dogs. Daniel carries her into the party to seek help and then Anton takes over and gets the doctor to inspect her. She stays at the De Vera mansion for a few days, just until her foot recovers. It then seems that Anton has fallen hard for Andrea and Monique for Daniel but they are not interested. Daniel and Andrea love each other very much and made a promise to always be together. To physically seal the deal, they go to the lighthouse near the beach, Daniel gives Andrea a locket with their pictures in it and the two make love. When Andrea comes home from the lighthouse, she meets her brother and he tells her that he has made a business deal with Anton: the deal will only work if Andrea agrees to marry Anton. At this Andrea refuses because she clearly loves Daniel but Jason doesn't care about her or her happiness. He threatens to kill her if she doesn't obey him and starts beating her. She cries herself to sleep and hears Daniel calling to her from her window. She ignores him in fear that Jason might catch her if she tried to meet up with him. The next day Daniel tries to meet up with Andrea again but she unwillingly ignores him and heads into Anton's house. Shocked, he tries again to talk to her but she tries to avoid him. He finally gets her attention and interrogates her about her being at Anton's house instead of meeting with him. She doesn't answer until she is questioned about the wound under her lip, the one given to her by Jason the previous night. She says that it was nothing, that she tripped and hurt herself. She tells Daniel not to worry about anything; everything's gonna be alright. In the next scene the couple intimately make out at Daniel's house but they are interrupted when Jason furiously barges in at the sight of the two kissing. He shouts at Andrea and pulls at her hair and then goes after Daniel who he beats to the ground, his final blow was to the head with a wooden crate full of bottles. He leaves the scene and Andrea attended to the now unconscious Daniel, asking him to forgive her. Daniel has regained consciousness again and a few days later he went down by the lake to wash off his wounds. Monique sees him there and she tries to flirt with him. She asks him if he was going to Andrea's birthday party but he replies by saying that he wasn't invited. Monique tells him that she was invited and now she's inviting him so the two went to Andrea's party together. Once there, Andrea had just blown out her candles when she noticed that Daniel has attended. She thinks nothing of it and the party continues. Anton then holds a box out in front of her and opens it, revealing a necklace with a diamond pendant. Daniel sees that Andrea is still wearing the locket that he gave her and he is surprised when she had to take it off just to try on Anton's necklace. Then Anton gets down on one knee and asks Andrea if she loves him. Despite her heart telling her the contrary, she sadly looks up at Daniel and says yes. Daniel is shocked to hear this after everything that he and Andrea have been through together. Anton then asks her to marry him and before she could answer, Daniel had already fled from the party. Andrea says she would think about it and runs off to find Daniel and explain things to him. She searches everywhere but once she gets to his house, she finds no one and has concluded that he took all his savings and ran away. Andrea gets married to Anton according to her brother's wishes and Daniel becomes a very successful man. Three years have passed since Andrea's party and one day Daniel decides to return to his hometown. Anton, Andrea and Monique patiently wait for a friend of Anton's, someone who he has made business with. The man arrives on a yacht and he turns out to be Daniel. Everybody is surprised at this, especially Andrea. Daniel tries to win over Monique's heart again in attempts to make Andrea jealous. Andrea at this point is not jealous at all, in fact she is still so shocked by Daniel's presence that she faints. Andrea is revived and that night, Daniel comes by Andrea and Anton's house to speak to Andrea. The maid helps the two meet in the backyard and it is revealed that their feelings for each other have not changed one bit. Daniel tells her to meet him later at the lighthouse and Andrea goes back into the house to prepare for the ""meeting"" and looks for the locket that Daniel gave her three years back. Anton goes up to their room and the couple sleeps together. Then when Andrea was sure that Anton had fallen asleep, she goes to the lighthouse to meet with Daniel and the two made love. When Andrea comes home from the lighthouse, she is shocked to see that Anton has awakened and that he knows where she has been and with whom. He shows her that he also knows about the locket which she forgot to wear when she went to meet up with Daniel and he throws it to the ground. He then approaches Andrea and pulls at her hair asking her questions. At this time Monique walks into this scene of the fight and asks what is going on. Anton says that Andrea is making a fool out of him, and pretending to love him when she really loves someone else. Then Andrea tells Anton to let her go because Daniel is waiting for her at the lighthouse but Anton tells her to let him wait forever and her takes her to their bedroom. Monique follows to ask further questions when she notices Andrea's locket on the floor. She picks it up and looks at the pictures; it has now become clear to her as to what this was all about. Then she goes to the lighthouse to meet Daniel instead of Andrea and she deceives him, telling him that Andrea sent her to tell him that she doesn't love him any more and that she has changed her mind and loves Anton. She gives Daniel back the locket. The next night Andrea, Anton, Monique and Daniel have dinner together on the beach. There, Daniel declares that the yacht that he arrived in a few days ago now belongs to Monique. Also, just like Anton did when he proposed to Andrea, Daniel proposed to Monique with a necklace. Shocked and surprised, Monique accepts and Andrea is crushed. Daniel and Anton go off to talk for a while and they make a deal: Anton will let Daniel marry his sister only if once they marry, they will move somewhere far away to settle. Daniel agrees. Meanwhile, Monique tells Andrea how excited she is about the event that has just occurred, but Andrea is not at all happy for her friend. She tells her not to marry Daniel because she will be truly heartbroken, that he only wants to marry her to make Andrea jealous. Monique does not believe her and leaves. When Andrea and Anton go to bed, Andrea begs Anton not to let his sister and Daniel marry because it will shatter her heart into a million pieces. In the middle of the night, Andrea wakes up, and she can be seen in the bathroom clutching her stomach and seems to be in massive pain. The next morning she is still asleep, and Anton is watching her. She starts muttering words in her sleep, as if she was talking to Daniel, saying such things as ""Daniel, don't go, don't leave me."" Anton checks on her, feels her forehead and calls the doctor. After the examination, the doctor concludes that Andrea has a fever and that she has to take a special medicine to get rid of the infection that is causing it. The doctor explains that he cannot give Andrea antibiotics because it could harm the baby. Anton doesn't know she had a baby and the doctor states that Andrea is, in fact, pregnant, but she has an ectopic pregnancy. If Andrea is not treated soon she could have a haemorrhage or severe internal bleeding. Seeing as how Anton could not have been able to impregnate Andrea because he is infertile, the only explanation for her pregnancy is Daniel. As soon as the doctor leaves, Anton locks Andrea and himself in the bedroom and he starts to beat her. He calls her a shameless whore and he keeps hitting her as she tries to get up and walk. The maid and Monique overhear Anton and Andrea from the outside of the door and when they hear that Daniel got Andrea pregnant, Monique cries, heartbroken after hearing the news. She then runs to Daniel's house and tells him what she has just found out. Anton keeps on hitting Andrea despite the screaming and pleading for him to stop. Then she falls to the ground, and Anton is about to hit her again when he sees that the white dress she is wearing has blood on it. He stops and realizes his mistake just as Daniel kicks down the door and runs to Andrea's side. He carries her out of the house, not a word said to anyone. Daniel takes Andrea to the beach where they talk. The two profess their undying love for each other and promise that they will live in each other's memories. After the promise was made, Andrea dies. The movie is brought back to the grandfather from the beginning of the movie. His grandchildren ask if Andrea is still alive and he answers ""Yes. She is still alive right here, in my heart."" A montage shows Andrea and Daniel playing together on the beach. At the end it then shows a clip of him on the sand, his hand held out, holding the same locket with Daniel and Andrea's picture in it. This implies that the he is, in fact Daniel and that his last memory was of Andrea and himself, being together at last."

One day Jason and Daniel got into a fight when their parents weren't home and Jason beat him up and told him that he'd be sleeping outside that night. Andrea goes out to comfort Daniel and the two imply that they love each other, despite their young age. The two play together and pretend to get married: Andrea is the bride, Daniel the groom and the De Vera's daughter, Monique, is the bridesmaid. Monique complains that she is always the bridesmaid and now she wants to have her turn at marrying Daniel. One day, Andrea's parents have news that they're moving into the hacienda behind the De Vera mansion and Jason, disappointed that he won't actually be living in the big house, runs away swearing to one day get rid of Daniel for good. Now Andrea and Daniel are in their early twenties and one fateful day, Andrea's parents get into a car accident and die. Jason secretly comes back for his parents funeral and afterwards, he shows up at the hacienda and tells Daniel and Andrea that he is the head of the household and kicks Daniel out. The De Vera's children, Antonio (aka Anton, and Monique, come back from studying abroad and their mother throws them a welcome home party. After hearing that Monique has returned, Andrea and Daniel go to check it out even though they weren't invited. Andrea had a scheme to get a glimpse of the party but she was unable to see anything when she got bitten by one of the guard dogs. Daniel carries her into the party to seek help and then Anton takes over and gets the doctor to inspect her. She stays at the De Vera mansion for a few days, just until her foot recovers. It then seems that Anton has fallen hard for Andrea and Monique for Daniel but they are not interested. Daniel and Andrea love each other very much and made a promise to always be together. To physically seal the deal, they go to the lighthouse near the beach, Daniel gives Andrea a locket with their pictures in it and the two make love. When Andrea comes home from the lighthouse, she meets her brother and he tells her that he has made a business deal with Anton: the deal will only work if Andrea agrees to marry Anton. At this Andrea refuses because she clearly loves Daniel but Jason doesn't care about her or her happiness. He threatens to kill her if she doesn't obey him and starts beating her. She cries herself to sleep and hears Daniel calling to her from her window. She ignores him in fear that Jason might catch her if she tried to meet up with him. The next day Daniel tries to meet up with Andrea again but she unwillingly ignores him and heads into Anton's house. Shocked, he tries again to talk to her but she tries to avoid him. He finally gets her attention and interrogates her about her being at Anton's house instead of meeting with him. She doesn't answer until she is questioned about the wound under her lip, the one given to her by Jason the previous night. She says that it was nothing, that she tripped and hurt herself. She tells Daniel not to worry about anything; everything's gonna be alright. In the next scene the couple intimately make out at Daniel's house but they are interrupted when Jason furiously barges in at the sight of the two kissing. He shouts at Andrea and pulls at her hair and then goes after Daniel who he beats to the ground, his final blow was to the head with a wooden crate full of bottles. He leaves the scene and Andrea attended to the now unconscious Daniel, asking him to forgive her. Daniel has regained consciousness again and a few days later he went down by the lake to wash off his wounds. Monique sees him there and she tries to flirt with him. She asks him if he was going to Andrea's birthday party but he replies by saying that he wasn't invited. Monique tells him that she was invited and now she's inviting him so the two went to Andrea's party together. Once there, Andrea had just blown out her candles when she noticed that Daniel has attended. She thinks nothing of it and the party continues. Anton then holds a box out in front of her and opens it, revealing a necklace with a diamond pendant. Daniel sees that Andrea is still wearing the locket that he gave her and he is surprised when she had to take it off just to try on Anton's necklace. Then Anton gets down on one knee and asks Andrea if she loves him. Despite her heart telling her the contrary, she sadly looks up at Daniel and says yes. Daniel is shocked to hear this after everything that he and Andrea have been through together. Anton then asks her to marry him and before she could answer, Daniel had already fled from the party. Andrea says she would think about it and runs off to find Daniel and explain things to him. She searches everywhere but once she gets to his house, she finds no one and has concluded that he took all his savings and ran away. Andrea gets married to Anton according to her brother's wishes and Daniel becomes a very successful man. Three years have passed since Andrea's party and one day Daniel decides to return to his hometown. Anton, Andrea and Monique patiently wait for a friend of Anton's, someone who he has made business with. The man arrives on a yacht and he turns out to be Daniel. Everybody is surprised at this, especially Andrea. Daniel tries to win over Monique's heart again in attempts to make Andrea jealous. Andrea at this point is not jealous at all, in fact she is still so shocked by Daniel's presence that she faints. Andrea is revived and that night, Daniel comes by Andrea and Anton's house to speak to Andrea. The maid helps the two meet in the backyard and it is revealed that their feelings for each other have not changed one bit. Daniel tells her to meet him later at the lighthouse and Andrea goes back into the house to prepare for the ""meeting"" and looks for the locket that Daniel gave her three years back. Anton goes up to their room and the couple sleeps together. Then when Andrea was sure that Anton had fallen asleep, she goes to the lighthouse to meet with Daniel and the two made love. When Andrea comes home from the lighthouse, she is shocked to see that Anton has awakened and that he knows where she has been and with whom. He shows her that he also knows about the locket which she forgot to wear when she went to meet up with Daniel and he throws it to the ground. He then approaches Andrea and pulls at her hair asking her questions. At this time Monique walks into this scene of the fight and asks what is going on. Anton says that Andrea is making a fool out of him, and pretending to love him when she really loves someone else. Then Andrea tells Anton to let her go because Daniel is waiting for her at the lighthouse but Anton tells her to let him wait forever and her takes her to their bedroom. Monique follows to ask further questions when she notices Andrea's locket on the floor. She picks it up and looks at the pictures; it has now become clear to her as to what this was all about. Then she goes to the lighthouse to meet Daniel instead of Andrea and she deceives him, telling him that Andrea sent her to tell him that she doesn't love him any more and that she has changed her mind and loves Anton. She gives Daniel back the locket. The next night Andrea, Anton, Monique and Daniel have dinner together on the beach. There, Daniel declares that the yacht that he arrived in a few days ago now belongs to Monique. Also, just like Anton did when he proposed to Andrea, Daniel proposed to Monique with a necklace. Shocked and surprised, Monique accepts and Andrea is crushed. Daniel and Anton go off to talk for a while and they make a deal: Anton will let Daniel marry his sister only if once they marry, they will move somewhere far away to settle. Daniel agrees. Meanwhile, Monique tells Andrea how excited she is about the event that has just occurred, but Andrea is not at all happy for her friend. She tells her not to marry Daniel because she will be truly heartbroken, that he only wants to marry her to make Andrea jealous. Monique does not believe her and leaves. When Andrea and Anton go to bed, Andrea begs Anton not to let his sister and Daniel marry because it will shatter her heart into a million pieces. In the middle of the night, Andrea wakes up, and she can be seen in the bathroom clutching her stomach and seems to be in massive pain. The next morning she is still asleep, and Anton is watching her. She starts muttering words in her sleep, as if she was talking to Daniel, saying such things as ""Daniel, don't go, don't leave me."" Anton checks on her, feels her forehead and calls the doctor. After the examination, the doctor concludes that Andrea has a fever and that she has to take a special medicine to get rid of the infection that is causing it. The doctor explains that he cannot give Andrea antibiotics because it could harm the baby. Anton doesn't know she had a baby and the doctor states that Andrea is, in fact, pregnant, but she has an ectopic pregnancy. If Andrea is not treated soon she could have a haemorrhage or severe internal bleeding. Seeing as how Anton could not have been able to impregnate Andrea because he is infertile, the only explanation for her pregnancy is Daniel. As soon as the doctor leaves, Anton locks Andrea and himself in the bedroom and he starts to beat her. He calls her a shameless whore and he keeps hitting her as she tries to get up and walk. The maid and Monique overhear Anton and Andrea from the outside of the door and when they hear that Daniel got Andrea pregnant, Monique cries, heartbroken after hearing the news. She then runs to Daniel's house and tells him what she has just found out. Anton keeps on hitting Andrea despite the screaming and pleading for him to stop. Then she falls to the ground, and Anton is about to hit her again when he sees that the white dress she is wearing has blood on it. He stops and realizes his mistake just as Daniel kicks down the door and runs to Andrea's side. He carries her out of the house, not a word said to anyone. Daniel takes Andrea to the beach where they talk. The two profess their undying love for each other and promise that they will live in each other's memories. After the promise was made, Andrea dies. The movie is brought back to the grandfather from the beginning of the movie. His grandchildren ask if Andrea is still alive and he answers ""Yes. She is still alive right here, in my heart."" A montage shows Andrea and Daniel playing together on the beach. At the end it then shows a clip of him on the sand, his hand held out, holding the same locket with Daniel and Andrea's picture in it. This implies that the he is, in fact Daniel and that his last memory was of Andrea and himself, being together at last."

Before he gets beat up by the angry dog, Tom slams Spike on the head with the handle and steals away as Spike falls on his own dream house. Tom hides, but comes across Jerry in no time. He spots a roller and attempts to mow Jerry down with it; Spike, sleeping in his completed house, spots the chase aimed right at him. He holds out his hand, ordering the cat to stop, but Tom mows right over him, making an arrow shape. Tom chases Jerry into his mousehole and lights a firework, which Jerry promptly throws into Spike's dog house. Tom tries to remove the firework, but is caught by Spike. Tom retreats innocently while Spike starts to look inside; Tom discourages the dog from doing so, but Spike pushes him away and looks inside anyway. The firework explodes, leaving Spike in a blackface sunflower appearance. Tom chases Jerry up the power pole seen earlier and chops it down. Spike is repairing his house when he spots the falling behemoth. He frantically moves to the front yard, where the very end of the pole falls and smashes his home. Spike, annoyed, builds his next home in a tree and hammers ""Home sweet home"". Quite unfortunately for him, Tom has followed Jerry to this tree and chops it down as Jerry climbs to the top of it; Spike mutters ""Timber"" in frustration. Spike has finally achieved peace and quiet in his house, and Jerry is sleeping on top of it. Tom spots the mouse from through a hole in the fence and lassoes him. Jerry wakes up as he's being pulled off the house and pulls the rope back, launching Tom into the fence. Extremely miffed, Tom pulls back, but Jerry has hooked the rope to Spike's house and the dog is pulled all the way into the fence, destroying his house again. Tom tries five more times to get Spike through the fence, jolting the dog each time, and then uses the nearby fire hydrant as a pulley to squeeze Spike through the hole in the fence. The weight of Spike flattens Tom into the fence, which causes the cat to realize who he is holding. Tom tosses Spike over the fence and runs away, but Spike grabs Tom's tail through the hole and pulls him back repeatedly just as Tom had done to him. Then Spike and Jerry are working as partners to finish Spike's house for good, with Tom as his slave, ready to receive whippings from the dog. Tom is forced to do every single task at once."

It shows Sherman marching 62,000 Union troops over 650 miles in less than 100 days, and losing only 600 men along the way. The march introduces a new concept to the already brutal Civil War: total war, where the distinctions between combatants and civilians is blurred. While hated by white Southerners as a destroyer, Sherman is hailed by black Southerners as a liberator. It ends with Union victory and closes with Sherman as an old man living in New York and fondly remembering how his ""nephews"" and their ""uncle Billy"" would make ten miles a day. The documentary utilizes state of the art production techniques including CGI, special effects and historical re-creations. It relies on historical reenactors to play Sherman's soldiers and all dialogue is in fact quotes from historical sources: letters, Sherman's memoirs, diaries, etc. The documentary features a psychological profile on Sherman, stating that in the months leading up to the Civil War he was accused of being insane and that he contemplated suicide. Bill Oberst, the actor playing Sherman, states in a behind-the-scenes featurette that while the general will always be a controversial figure, he hopes that the documentary will shed light on why the man did what he did. It emphasizes that Sherman was loved by the enslaved blacks whom he freed and that while he did not see himself as fighting to destroy slavery, he nevertheless made a point of treating blacks whom he meet with courtesy and respect.  The documentary also mentions that Sherman killed far fewer Confederate soldiers and civilians than did Ulysses S. Grant, his friend and fellow general, yet Sherman was the one vilified. The scholars interviewed postulate that the South had need for a scapegoat in the wake of the Civil War and that Sherman was the easiest target. For his part, Sherman is stated to have seen himself as only doing his duty and that he did not care what people said about him one way or the other."

The very patriotic attitude of Steve's father earned him the nickname Captain America, and his father is spoken of as having been murdered. Rogers, a former Marine now making what little living he makes as an artist, is inspired by this story to sketch a super-hero. After receiving potentially fatal injuries in an accident, he is administered an experimental chemical called the FLAG — Full Latent Ability Gain—formula  which not only saves his life but also enhances his body with heightened strength and reflexes. These new abilities lead Dr. Simon Mills , the research biochemist and intelligence official who had told Rogers about his father, to recruit him and give Steve a costume based on his drawing. As Captain America, he also makes significant use of a specialized reconstruction of the van he has been driving, out the rear of which can be launched a modified motorcycle. Its functions include a rocket thrust for a fast start out of the van, a jet boost for increased speed, a setting to allow the bike to be ridden with less noise for stealthier movement and a hang glider structure which can allow the bike to glide to the ground with some forward momentum, although it must be jettisoned upon landing.

Chen Kuan Tai is Iron, a naive young man who is unaware that his father is a leader of this underground movement. An undercover operative named Ho Yeng, who conned his way into joining the rebellion, betrays Iron’s father. The entire family is captured  and the General schedules their executions the following day. Since the leader of the rebellion is now in his clutches, the General focuses on the capture of his enemy’s son, Iron. A witness to this heinous act warns Iron and he manages to escape the village and avoid capture from the Qing army. He becomes a wild, animalistic wanderer who survives by stealing food from a nearby Shaolin temple. He also watches the hopefuls who train in the martial arts there. A group of students eventually catch him breaking into the temple, and they comment on his monkey-like agility. One student  follows him into the woods and suggests that Iron become a student of the Shaolin Temple. The Abbot is more than happy to accept him as a pupil, but he notices the look of anger in the young man’s eyes. Iron refuses to comment on his agenda or his identity, so the Abbott assigns him a new identity—that of Iron Monkey. Iron Monkey soon proves himself a natural in the temple training arena. In a short time, he becomes a top student, at the expense of his peers’ friendship . Soon, the head monks inform the students that they must select a specialized martial arts technique. Naturally, Iron Monkey selects the fearsome Monkey Fist method, which is unrivaled in the martial arts world, except for Eagle’s Claw style. The Abbot sends Iron Monkey out into the wilderness where he is trained by the exiled Bitter Monk. In a year’s time, Iron Monkey masters the Monkey Fist and returns to the temple with confidence and ability. The Abbott welcomes him back, but senses that Iron Monkey is still motivated by hatred and rage. The Abbot tells him that he must alleviate his inner pain, and return to the temple a wiser man cleansed of hatred. The timing is perfect as the General’s guard intrude upon the Shaolin temple to recruit martial artists to the Qing cause. But the students and monks are loyal to their beliefs, and no one sells out—except for Iron Monkey. Like the hated betrayer of his father, Ho Yeng, Iron Monkey plans to join the Manchus and destroy their organization from within. His ultimate goal is to get close to the General, so he can assassinate the man responsible for the death of his family. But first he must prove himself. The General doesn’t trust Iron Monkey and assigns him the task of hunting and killing suspected revolutionaries. Iron Monkey immerses himself in Manchu propaganda and begins beating and killing his own people! But, the Captains and the General take notice of his skills and behavior, and he is given a promotion. The Manchus still don’t trust him and orders him to kill more radicals. The more people Iron Monkey kills, the higher he rises in the Qing hierarchy. Eventually he becomes equal in rank to the Captains that recruited him. But he has still not achieved his goal of meeting the General. When the Manchus order Iron Monkey to crush the Shaolin Temple itself, he realizes he must finally make his move. He confronts the entire chain of the Manchu hierarchy, starting with the traitor Ho Yeng, to the Captains, and finally the General himself. However, the General did not earn his position for nothing. He is a master of the Eagle’s Claw—the only form of martial arts that can overcome the Monkey Fist.

They go in and explore, where one of them receives a machete to the groin by a laughing man wearing a checkered jacket, while Ty runs away screaming. Flash to park ranger, Roy McLean  at his home, followed by a van of five teens looking to go camping, but becoming lost. He warns them not to keep going the way they're going, but they ignore him and keep driving straight, and we are introduced to them: Warren  the blonde, body builder, his girlfriend Constance , the shy, blonde girl, Jonathon , the goofy, horny partygoer, his provocative girlfriend, Megan , and the nerdy camera operator, Daniel . On their way to the campsite, they almost hit a frantic, dirty Ty who tells them to drive away, but they do not listen, and he goes running off into the trees. They finally find a campsite and begin to set up, drinking beer, eating food, and listening to music, not caring about anything around them. When night falls they go to sleep, all the while being watched by something in the woods. The next morning, they eat breakfast and go to the waterfall, seeing a young girl named Merry Logan  who runs off into the woods. Meanwhile, Megan and Jonathon have gone skinnydipping in the lake, not knowing someone is under the water with them. Megan does not realize that Jonathon has gotten out of the water, and feels hands touching her, assuming it's Jonathon, until seeing him on shore, in which she begins to panic and swims to safety. When the group breaks off to go exploring, Jonathon spots Merry and begins to chase her asking what her name is and telling her he will not hurt her. She thinks this is a game and runs out into a clearing where she sees something horrible, backing up towards the trees. Jonathon figures it's the roped passageway over the river ahead, and begins to go across, but Merry runs and he gives chase, only to be hit in the hand with a machete by a deformed, giggling man in a checkered shirt. Jonathon runs to the other side, only to have the rope break, almost plunging him to his death in the rapids below. As he begins to climb up, he is greeted by the same man, who shoves him off to his death with his boot. Megan and Daniel have gone off to takes pictures of the woods and come across the church and a graveyard. Daniel breaks his glasses and sees a figure coming through the woods, and thinking it's Jonathon tells Megan, who decides to make it look like they're making out. Daniel sees the figure approach, and upon realizing it's not Jonathon, pushes Megan out of the way and is stabbed through the stomach with the machete. Megan sees the checkered shirt killer and runs into the church, where she sees him outside picking up Daniel's camera. She turns around and is greeted by the same man, and realizes that they're identical twins, just as he begins to chop her up with the machete as the other takes pictures through the window. Meanwhile, Warren and Constance have met up back at camp, but cannot find anyone else, until they spot Jonathon's body floating around in the river, and pull him out, knowing it's too late to save him. They go to find the others but cannot find any trace of them, as night approaches, so they go back to get the keys from Jonathon's body which has disappeared. Ty finally meets up with Roy and tells him all about the killer twins at the church, and Roy goes out on his horse to find the teens, and comes across Merry's family, who consist of a crazy father, and silent sister/mother. They tell him that the twins were actually theirs and that their mother died after having them, so he mated with his daughter and had Merry. Warren goes to find Jonathon's body to get the car keys, and leaves Constance at the campfire, where she is attacked by one of the twins who chases her up a tree. Warren finds Jonathon's body along with Daniel's who is wearing sunglasses and gets the keys, running back to camp with the ranger. The twin cuts down the tree Constance is in, and are about to kill her when Roy shoots him in the chest, killing him, and he tells the couple to go pack their things. They go back to camp, as Merry runs through the woods to find them. At camp, the other twin stabs Warren and tries to kill Constance, who instead rams her fist down his throat, choking and killing him. Then she stands up, and makes the same noises as them, noting that she may have gone insane, as Warren questions her and Merry watches from the trees, cut to the sunset view of the forest at the beginning.

It transpires that Professor Huston has been captured by a German military expedition on the same quest, led by Bockner , an stereotypical single-minded knackwurst-munching, bald-headed Colonel and a ruthless Turkish slave-trader and adventurer, Dogati . Huston is being forced to interpret another map, also believed to be genuine. The two rival expeditions shadow each other, clashing on several occasions, and finally enter the tribal lands of the Kukuana who capture them. The tribe is under the control of the evil priestess, Gagoola, who has Quatermain hung upside down over a pond full of crocodiles. Just when all seems lost, Umbopo arrives and after defeating Gagoola's warriors in combat, reveals his identity as an exiled tribal chief and the rightful ruler of the Kukuanas. As the tribesmen submit to him, Gagoola captures Jesse and flees into caves in the depths of the Breasts of Sheba, the twin mountain peaks where the mines are located. They are pursued by Bockner and Dogati, who attack the village in full force. They follow Quatermain and Umbopo to the entrance to the mines, but are hampered by a moat of quicksand. Bockner orders his men forward into the moat, but they have trouble crossing it. Dogati then kills all of Bockner's soldiers, as well as most of his own men, and uses their bodies as stepping stones to cross the moat safely. As they approach the entrance, Bockner shoots Dogati and takes command of what little remains of the party. Inside the mines, Quatermain and Umbopo rescue Jesse and find the resting place of all the former tribal queens, including the Queen of Sheba herself, encased in crystal. Umbopo explains that Gagoola had attempted to sacrifice Jesse in order to keep her power as the Kukuanas' ruler because of Jessie's strong resemblance to the Queen of Sheba. Then Gagoola appears and taunts Umbopo, who pursues her through the caverns. As Bockner and his men arrive next, Quatermain and Jessie flee for safety, but end up in the cavern's treasure chamber, which is full of raw diamonds and other priceless treasures. As they gather some of the diamonds to take with them, Bockner hears their voices from outside the chamber, but before he can enter, Gagoola activates a hidden rock switch and seals Quatermain and Jessie inside the chamber. The switch also triggers a trap that causes the ceiling of the chamber, which is lined with stalactites to lower on them. Quatermain and Jessie manage to stop the ceiling trap, but then the chamber begins filling up with water. Just as the chamber fills completely, a lit stick of dynamite set by Bockner outside the chamber door explodes, sending them both spewing out of the chamber in the resulting flood to safety. Bockner enters the chamber and quickly lays claim to the treasure, only to be confronted by a wounded, but very much alive, Dogati, who was wearing a protective vest that shielded him from the bullets. He then forces Bockner to swallow some of the diamonds, intending to cut him open to retrieve them later on. Meanwhile, Umbopo finally corners Gagoola. But rather than face his judgment, she instead leaps down one of the volcano's shafts and is incinerated when she lands in the molten lava below. However, the reaction causes a series of eruptions throughout the mines. Dogati is partially buried when the treasure chamber's ceiling collapses, but Bockner is unharmed. He gloats to Dogati after claiming a few more diamonds for himself, then leaves the chamber. But not before firing his gun at the ruined ceiling, burying Dogati alive. Quatermain, Jessie and Umbopa quickly flee for their lives through the collapsing caverns. They cross over a small booby- trapped lake , only to be stopped by Bockner, who demands they surrender their diamonds to him. Quatermain places the diamonds on the central stepping stone that triggers the trap and tells Bockner to come take the diamonds himself if he wants them. Bockner does so and falls into the lake, only to be seized in the jaws of a Mokele-mbembe and dragged beneath the water. The trap resets itself and the diamonds rise back to the surface, but Umbopo warns Quatermain and Jesse not to take them, saying they belong to the mountain. The trio continue their escape through the caverns, which becomes even more dangerous as the lava chamber they are in is full of fire and falling rocks. Quatermain tells Umbopo to take Jessie through to safety while he follows them. But before he can do so, he is struck down by Dogati, who survived the cave-in. A brutal fight between them ensues, but Quatermain gains the upper hand at the last instant, sending Dogati falling into the chamber's lava pit to his death. Quatermain manages to escape from the mines at the last minute, just as the volcano explodes, sealing the entrance forever. Returning to the village, Umbopo assumes his rightful place as the ruler of the Kukuanas and he and his people bid a fond farewell to Quatermain and Jesse. As they exit the village, they each reveal they had kept a diamond from the mines as a souvenir of their adventure and the movie ends with them kissing outside the village gates.

Together with his companion, the mysterious Umbopo, they penetrate unknown country, following a map believed to be genuine. It transpires that Professor Huston has been captured by a German military expedition on the same quest, led by Bockner , an stereotypical single-minded knackwurst-munching, bald-headed Colonel and a ruthless Turkish slave-trader and adventurer, Dogati . Huston is being forced to interpret another map, also believed to be genuine. The two rival expeditions shadow each other, clashing on several occasions, and finally enter the tribal lands of the Kukuana who capture them. The tribe is under the control of the evil priestess, Gagoola, who has Quatermain hung upside down over a pond full of crocodiles.

She is taken to a hospital in Mercara, Karnataka, where the doctor declares that she has Amnesia due to the accident, and has forgotten herself and her past, which gives the film its title aptly ""Innale"" meaning ""yesterday"". Gauri, forgets her, larger past and starts to move with courage, towards her new found self, after struggling within herself, asking questions. She also meets mallicious people who claim to be her well wishers, taking advantage of her vulnerability. She fights them with the help of the brave Mr. Sharath Menon , who protects her during the transition to become the new Maya. Dr. Sandhya  who treated Gauri, is also Sharath's mother. She too comforts Gauri and allows her to become Maya. Though she does worry about, what is to follow. Sandhya decides to meet anyone who claim to be Gauri's family, so that she could help out Gauri who is now Maya. Sharath brings actors to make Dr. Sandhya believe that Gauri has parents, to get his mother's consent to marry Gauri with whom he has deeply fallen in love with. Sandhya has no other choice than to leave, the young lovers to their own fate.  Meanwhile Dr. Narendran , Gauri's husband, starts to search for his lost wife. After much searching with all his friends and resources he finally gets information about a girl who was an accident victim on a hill station. He calls Sandhya during her birthday party, where the doctor also announces the engagement of Maya with her son, Sharath. Sandhya is shocked and informs her son about Dr. Narendran's phone call. Narendran reminiscences memories of the beautiful days spent with his lovely wife Gauri. The three main characters meet at last in an old house covered in mist, on a haunting valley. The scene talks for itself in silence, where Narendran passes the mist only to find the completely transformed Gauri. He becomes speechless after seeing his wife, who watch and talk to him like a complete stranger. He decides that she has indeed become a new person and it would be unfair to bring her more sorrow by revealing the truth that she is his wife. Tears fill his sad eyes, unable to believe she failed to recognise him. The final dialogue where Sharath happily asks ""So she is not the person you were looking for,right? "" to which Narendran answers, no by only shaking his head, is a heart wrenching moment. He understands that Sharath and Maya are deeply in love with each other and leaves in haste. The last scene shows the bewildered Maya and Sharath staring at him, leaving so abruptly, without drinking the tea she made. Narendran's sadness is forever, but will Maya regain her past, unanswered questions remain lurking in the mist around. The film warns us about how life can change almost unapologetically. Change can be such a boon to many and a horrible disaster to many others."

She is terribly depressed, and after being knocked out of the way by a rush of girls, she meets head girl Kelly Jones who shows her around the school and introduces her to various cliques – Posh Totty, Chavs, Emos, Geeks, and First Years. At her bed, a booby trap pours gunge and drops feathers onto Annabelle, who attempts to clean up in the showers, but falls victim to another trap when the girls set up cameras directly connected to YouTube, steal her clothes and towels, and turn up the water temperature, forcing her to run through the halls naked. Once dressed, Annabelle phones and demands to be taken home. Carnaby, however, pretends to lose reception as he is enjoying his freedom without Annabelle. In frustration, Annabelle hits her mobile phone with a hockey stick across the hall and smashes a marble bust, smashing it into pieces. Miss Cleaver the Sports Teacher sees this and instantly drafts her into the school hockey team. Flash Harry pays a visit to the school to deal bootleg goods, and makes a deal with the girls for some lab-made vodka. A few days later, St Trinian hosts a hockey match against Annabelle's old school – their rivals Cheltenham Ladies' College, captained by Verity Thwaites, the school bully; Annabelle was her favourite victim. The girls give a hostile and violent welcome to their visitors and the match ends in a brawl; the St Trinian's matron is the referee and does not know the rules, so the girls cheat excessively. Eventually, there is a tie and the final shot is left up to Annabelle, but is intimidated by Verity. Kelly takes her place and scores, knocking Verity out in the process. During the match, Education Minister and Verity's father Geoffrey Thwaites comes to the school. He is planning to force it to raise its very poor standards, and to use it as a warning for other schools. He is taken aback when introduced to the Headmistress, and it is revealed that not only do they know each other, but previously had a romantic relationship. Geoffrey sneaks into the school and discovers many horrors, including a girl trapped in a tank of formaldehyde in the art rooms and the illegal vodka, which is so strong that he instantly becomes tipsy after a slight taste. He accidentally knocks over a tank of biting ants, which crawl all over his shoes and up his trousers. Geoffrey is about to escape the school when he hears the Posh Totties coming in. He hides from them in their dressing room . Still in hiding Geoffrey tries to remove his trousers to prevent him from being bitten by the ants when his phone rings, causing the Posh Totty to discover him and throw him out the window into a fountain. Drenched and humiliated, he declares war on Miss Fritton and the school. Celebrating their win over Cheltenham, the St Trinian's girls have a wild party. The morning after the victory party a banker Steve Furst stops by to inform Miss Fritton that St Trinian's owes the bank over half a million pounds, and if they don't get the money in four weeks the school will be shut down. Kelly and the head of the Geeks, Polly, realise this and Kelly tells the girls they must earn the money or else they will have to go to normal schools. Some days later through electronic spy cameras, the girls and especially Annabelle witness Carnaby attempting to broker a business deal with Miss Fritton. Carnaby wants to sell the school, that way they can repay the debt and split the profits. She refuses, inquiring about Annabelle. Carnaby reveals his true feelings about Annabelle – he does not like her and is not sure if he is really her father. With the help of Flash Harry, the girls decide to use crime to get the money and hatch a plan to steal the famous Girl with a Pearl Earring (or as Chelsea puts it, ""[[Girl with a Pearl Earring . They organize a school trip to the London National Art Gallery where it is being held, to scope out the scene. After seeing how difficult it is going to be, they give up, until the new English teacher Miss Dickinson casually mentions that the finals of the TV quiz show School Challenge competition are to be filmed in the grand hall of the gallery. As they make their plans, Thwaites decides to show the media exactly what St Trinian's is really like. However, the girls spot them and change around the classrooms until they are in perfect order. The only classroom that isn't changed is the one where preparations for the heist are taking place. As the press are about to enter, Annabelle manages to distract them by revealing that Verity, Thwaites' daughter, was the school bully at her old school. Miss Fritton arrives down the stairs dressed as Queen Elizabeth I. In the midst of the conversation between them, Miss Fritton's dog once again tries to mate with Thwaites' leg. Irritated, Geoffrey kicks him, sending him flying out the window before crashlanding in the lawnmower instantly killing him. In the middle of the night, Annabelle is woken up by the girls and as thanks for standing up for the school, is given a confidence-boosting makeover. Afterward when Kelly asks Annabelle how she feels, she replies ""Like a St Trinian!"" While still not fully accepted, she feels much stronger in herself. Annabelle tries to persuade Flash Harry to act as a prestigious gay German art dealer named Gerhardt von Struebel so that he can sell a false version of the painting to Carnaby. He feels unsure but Kelly persuades him to comply . The school team for School Challenge consists of the three Posh Totties, Chelsea, Peaches, and Chloe. They reach the final by cheating . During the final, Kelly, Chav Taylor, and emo Andrea foil the security for the painting that they're after and eventually retrieve it but on the way back the cable that they used to climb over the top of the audience of the final of School Challenge snaps just after Taylor and Andrea get over to the other side. Kelly gets stuck with no way to get to other side again. Miss Fritton sees that Kelly is trapped and goes to help, having to also distract Thwaites through a combination of liquor and seduction. Meanwhile, Annabelle takes care of Verity's threat to foil the girls' escape route by shooting her walkie-talkie with her hockey stick at Verity knocking her out. At the same time of these events, the girls win School Challenge. They had been using earpieces in which other students were feeding the answers to them, but after they stopped working the English teacher told them to use their own initiative, which had surprisingly good results. The school successfully gets the painting and sells it to Carnaby who fails to realise until he buys it that it is not the genuine print which has been returned to the police under the cover of St Trinian's finding it, but a copy painted by Miss Fritton. He faints and Flash, dressed as Gerhardt to give him the art, races to the car that is waiting for him. They receive a reward of £50,000 for returning the real painting, which they supposedly found. With the cash from Carnaby they pay back the money owed to the bank and St Trinian's stays in business."

Although the Khalif has offered a reward for his capture, the roguish Sinbad ignores Omar's warnings and nonchalantly sneaks into the palace. Spouting Omar's poetry, Sinbad romances Nerissa, one of the Khalif's harem girls, but is exposed by jealous slave Ameer, who also loves him. Both Sinbad and Omar are caught and brought before the Khalif for sentencing. Also on trial are Greek scholar Simon Aristides, and his daughter Kristina, Sinbad's childhood friend, who has been wrongfully accused of stealing. After the Khalif orders that Sinbad and Omar be executed, his advisor, Jiddah, persuades him to meet with Murad, the ambassador to Tamerlane, a Tartar leader whose forces are threatening to invade Baghdad. Murad boldly informs the Khalif that the Tartars will soon be storming the city and demands that he and his men be entertained in the meantime. Anxious to save Kristina, Sinbad reveals to the Khalif that Simon possesses the formula for an explosive called ""Greek fire"" and will share it with the Khalif in exchange for Simon's, Kristina's, Omar's and his freedom. The Khalif refuses to release Sinbad and Omar, but while they are incarcerated in the dungeon, Simon and Kristina give the ruler a private demonstration of Greek fire. As protection, Simon has entrusted the formula to Kristina, who can recite the instructions only while hypnotized. In front of the Khalif, Simon hypnotizes Kristina, who then gives her father directions for mixing the various bottled ingredients. Unknown to them, Jiddah is in cahoots with Murad, and both men are eavesdropping on the proceedings. Although Jiddah and Murad can hear Kristina telling her father how much of each item to use, they cannot ascertain the chemicals being poured by Simon. Meanwhile, the Khalif, ecstatic about the explosive, agrees to Simon's demand that Sinbad and Omar be freed in the morning. That night, Kristina confides in Ameer that she wants to marry Sinbad and asks her to tell him about his imminent release. Though jealous, Ameer delivers the message to Sinbad, but when she returns to Kristina's chambers, she finds Kristina gone and Simon murdered. Ameer sees Murad fleeing with Kristina and Simon's chemicals and sends a message via carrier pigeon before being caught by Jiddah. While torturing Ameer to reveal the bird's destination, Jiddah notices that she has a Forty Thieves tattoo on her shoulder. Although the Thieves, a band of raiders once led by Sinbad's father, are now dead, Ameer admits that their heirs have banded together, and Jiddah deduces that the message went to them. At dawn, Sinbad and Omar learn that their execution is to proceed as scheduled, but they escape the dungeon and fight their way to the Khalif's chambers. There, Sinbad offers to retrieve Kristina in exchange for his and Omar's freedom, some gold and a promise that he will be made second in command in Bagdad. The Khalif agrees and Sinbad rides off with Omar, unaware that Jiddah, having heard his exchange with the Khalif, is alerting Murad of his plan. Later, while resting in the desert, Sinbad and Omar are joined by Ameer, who reveals that Murad and his men are traveling in disguise with a caravan of merchants and that the Forty Thieves will attack them at first camp. Omar and Sinbad ride to the camp ahead of the caravan, and Sinbad has Omar bury him in the spot where he thinks Kristina's tent will be placed. Breathing through a reed, Sinbad remains buried in the Tartars' camp, far from Kristina's tent, until Murad unwittingly plucks his reed from the sand. Sinbad is forced to surface but manages to sneak into Kristina's tent and free her. As Sinbad, Omar and Kristina ride off, the Forty Thieves, who are all women, attack the camp and reclaim Simon's bottles. Omar, Sinbad and Kristina then go to the Forty Thieves's cave and, using the cry ""open sesame,"" signal a donkey named Sesame to open the ""door."" After arranging with Ghenia, the raiders' leader, Sinbad reunites with Ameer, but when he refuses to have ""eyes only for her,"" Ameer rejects him. Just then, Murad's men advance on the cave, and Sinbad quickly hypnotizes Kristina, who has fallen in love with Omar, and concocts some Greek fire using Simon's chemicals. Hurling torches coated with the explosive, the Thieves, Sinbad and Omar cripple Murad and his men. Sinbad then defeats Murad in a sword fight, and victory is declared. Later, Sinbad convinces the women to go with him to Bagdad and make peace with the Khalif. At the palace, the Khalif waits for Sinbad with Jiddah, whose duplicity he has yet to realize, preparing to execute him for failing his mission. When Sinbad appears with Kristina and a bevy of beautiful raiders, however, the Khalif embraces him and orders Jiddah to be de-tongued. At Sinbad's behest, Omar is made the royal poet, the Thieves are pardoned, and Sinbad is installed as second in command. Then as a final request, Sinbad asks Ameer to be his bride."

A biological contaminant is released into the atmosphere and over the following years, decimates nearly ninety percent of the world's population. Fleeing the poisoned planet, humanity relocates to a space station orbiting the Earth. It is there that life continues with the hope of one day returning to the planet's surface. The film unfolds during the probate hearing determining the disposition of assets of the estate of Abel Edwards beta, the clone of the founder of the Edwards Corporation , the most successful entertainment conglomerate of the 20th Century. The EC included not only an enormously successful film and television studio, but also the Abel Edwards' Fantastic Wonderlands Theme Parks based on the characters populating Abel Edwards' animated films. Due to their extensive animatronic background, the EC has morphed into a manufacturer whose primary products are humanoid robots. But their market share has fallen sharply and sales have softened. They understand the need to develop a new market, but after several failed attempts, recognize they lack the intuition and imagination necessary for the success of such a bold course change. As a last-ditch effort, their marketing department develops a plan to clone their dead genius founder, Abel Edwards. They will not only grow a genetic replica, but they will infuse him with the same life-altering experiences that shaped the original man. Nature plus nurture, or something like it. Upon his 25th birthday, Edwards takes the reins of the company and rides a 20-year wave of success with every passing day. When the potential rival of the status quo career politician abruptly drops out of the race, Edwards sees his chance to expand beyond his defined boundaries and bring the 'Edwards Standard of Living' directly into people's living rooms, rather than maintaining a park to give them a transitory experience. When Edwards moves from a 'Celebrity Politician' to a front-running candidate, the power struggle reaches its breaking point. The Anti-Reality Organizations finally have their scapegoat. Needless to say, he loses the Senate race in a landslide. In one fell swoop, Edwards has lost his son, the Senate seat and his position as CEO of the company. Edwards commandeers a space shuttle and heads for the site of the original Able Edwards Fantastic Wonderland beginning a journey of no return.

A ship comes, and the bridge is lifted. Though it is supposed to arrive an hour later, the train happens to arrive. The son sees this, and tries to warn his father, who is currently not paying attention and is unaware of the oncoming train. Just as the oncoming train approaches, his son falls into the drawbridge gear works while attempting to lower the bridge, leaving the father with a horrific choice. The father then lowers the bridge, the gears crushing the boy.

Because the Poet has set up shop in a spot usually reserved for a man named Hajj, some men kidnap the Poet and take him to the desert tent of Jawan, an elderly thief. Jawan, assuming that the Poet is Hajj, orders him to reverse the curse Hajj put on him fifteen years ago, which led to the kidnapping of Jawan's beloved son. The Poet asks for one hundred gold pieces to reverse the curse; Jawan agrees, and returns to Baghdad to look for his son. In Baghdad, a huge procession welcomes Lalume, favorite wife of the Wazir, back from Ababu. The King of Ababu is willing to give the Wazir a badly needed loan if the Wazir arranges for one of his three daughters to marry the young Caliph. Meanwhile, the Caliph, who has been traveling incognito, sees the Poet's daughter, Marsinah, and is immediately attracted to her. Marsinah falls in love with the Caliph, too, but she thinks he is a gardener. They arrange to meet in the garden that night. The Poet returns to Baghdad and begins spending his hundred gold pieces; then, the Wazir arrests the Poet because his purse carries the insignia of a wealthy family that was robbed. At the Wazir's court, Lalume is impressed with the Poet's looks and gift for words, and lets him defend himself against the charge of robbery. The Poet does, but also curses the Wazir. Jawan, brought before the Wazir on another charge, angrily confirms the Poet's story, and then notices a familiar amulet around the Wazir's neck. In this way, Jawan discovers his long-lost son. The Caliph announces that he plans to take a bride that night. The Wazir, fearing that this puts his loan from the king of Ababu in jeopardy, and fearing that the Poet's curse had something to do with it, takes Lalume's advice: they will make the Poet an Emir if he reverses the curse. The Poet happily accepts, and when the Wazir leaves him alone with Lalume, the two realize they have similar temperaments. Hearing the noise of the Caliph's wedding procession, and annoyed that the curse has not been reversed, the Wazir confines the Poet to the palace. The Poet orchestrates an elaborate ""curse-reversal"" scheme that enables him to sneak out; he finds his daughter Marsinah and convinces her that he will be killed unless they flee Baghdad. Despite Marsinah's protests—she wants to wait for her rendezvous and see the procession—they flee. Word spreads that the Caliph's bride was not there when the Caliph came to claim her. Since the ""curse reversal"" seemed to have worked, the Poet leaves Marsinah and returns to the palace. The Wazir wants to kill the Poet because he believes he has dangerous supernatural powers, but Lalume convinces her husband to keep the Poet in the palace and use his power. The Poet tells Lalume that he is worried about Marsinah, and Lalume suggests that she come to live in the palace. Marsinah arrives and confesses that she has fallen in love but does not know her beloved's name. Lalume hides Marsinah in the harem for her own protection. Meanwhile, the Caliph's men search Baghdad for Marsinah, and the Wazir suggest that the Caliph marry the three princesses and take pleasure in the harem. When the two men see Marsinah in the harem, the Wazir is shocked that the Caliph's intended bride is in his own palace, happy that she cannot, therefore, marry the Caliph. The Wazir tells Marsinah that she must marry him; and the disappointed Caliph must take another bride that night. When the Wazir privately congratulates the Poet on bringing the Caliph's true love into the Wazir's own harem, the Poet realizes that the Caliph is Marsinah's beloved. In revenge, he performs a trick that results in Wazir being held underwater in a pool.

The Caliph answers ""death,"" after which the Poet says the sentence has been carried out, then flees. The Wazir is still alive, however, and his guards capture the Poet and sentence him to death. Lalume saves the day by explaining everything to the Caliph. The Caliph sentences the Wazir to death and the Poet to exile. The Poet agrees, but asks to take the soon-to-be-widowed Lalume with him.

The King of Ababu is willing to give the Wazir a badly needed loan if the Wazir arranges for one of his three daughters to marry the young Caliph. Meanwhile, the Caliph, who has been traveling incognito, sees the Poet's daughter, Marsinah, and is immediately attracted to her. Marsinah falls in love with the Caliph, too, but she thinks he is a gardener. They arrange to meet in the garden that night. The Poet returns to Baghdad and begins spending his hundred gold pieces; then, the Wazir arrests the Poet because his purse carries the insignia of a wealthy family that was robbed. At the Wazir's court, Lalume is impressed with the Poet's looks and gift for words, and lets him defend himself against the charge of robbery. The Poet does, but also curses the Wazir. Jawan, brought before the Wazir on another charge, angrily confirms the Poet's story, and then notices a familiar amulet around the Wazir's neck. In this way, Jawan discovers his long-lost son. The Caliph announces that he plans to take a bride that night. The Wazir, fearing that this puts his loan from the king of Ababu in jeopardy, and fearing that the Poet's curse had something to do with it, takes Lalume's advice: they will make the Poet an Emir if he reverses the curse. The Poet happily accepts, and when the Wazir leaves him alone with Lalume, the two realize they have similar temperaments. Hearing the noise of the Caliph's wedding procession, and annoyed that the curse has not been reversed, the Wazir confines the Poet to the palace. The Poet orchestrates an elaborate ""curse-reversal"" scheme that enables him to sneak out; he finds his daughter Marsinah and convinces her that he will be killed unless they flee Baghdad. Despite Marsinah's protests—she wants to wait for her rendezvous and see the procession—they flee. Word spreads that the Caliph's bride was not there when the Caliph came to claim her. Since the ""curse reversal"" seemed to have worked, the Poet leaves Marsinah and returns to the palace. The Wazir wants to kill the Poet because he believes he has dangerous supernatural powers, but Lalume convinces her husband to keep the Poet in the palace and use his power. The Poet tells Lalume that he is worried about Marsinah, and Lalume suggests that she come to live in the palace. Marsinah arrives and confesses that she has fallen in love but does not know her beloved's name. Lalume hides Marsinah in the harem for her own protection. Meanwhile, the Caliph's men search Baghdad for Marsinah, and the Wazir suggest that the Caliph marry the three princesses and take pleasure in the harem. When the two men see Marsinah in the harem, the Wazir is shocked that the Caliph's intended bride is in his own palace, happy that she cannot, therefore, marry the Caliph. The Wazir tells Marsinah that she must marry him; and the disappointed Caliph must take another bride that night. When the Wazir privately congratulates the Poet on bringing the Caliph's true love into the Wazir's own harem, the Poet realizes that the Caliph is Marsinah's beloved. In revenge, he performs a trick that results in Wazir being held underwater in a pool. As the Wazir struggles, the Poet asks the Caliph what sentence should be given to a murderer and torturer who also cost him his bride. The Caliph answers ""death,"" after which the Poet says the sentence has been carried out, then flees. The Wazir is still alive, however, and his guards capture the Poet and sentence him to death. Lalume saves the day by explaining everything to the Caliph. The Caliph sentences the Wazir to death and the Poet to exile. The Poet agrees, but asks to take the soon-to-be-widowed Lalume with him. Thus the Poet weds Lalume and the Caliph weds Marsinah—all in the course of a single day."

When they start hunting him down, Jin Wu and his wife Akane sail to China both to escape their wrathful kinsmen, and for Jin Wu to complete revenge by finding the last man he holds responsible for his father's death. That man, Fukuda, leads a peaceful life as a mirror maker under the name of Uncle Foo. He has a young protégée, however: Jay , a smug martial artist who constantly tries to prove himself by taking up every opportunity to fight. Jay also constantly teases his lecherous servant Chee  and takes few things very seriously. However, as he sees his surrogate father attacked, Jay immediately rushes to his aid, but during several clashes he has to find out that he and the ninja are evenly matched. Eventually, it is revealed that Jin Wu’s father was not killed by his clan members; he had died as a hero in a rebellion instead. Ashamed of his own cowardice in escaping to China years before following that attempted uprising, Foo makes peace with Jin. But before their final encounter, Foo took poison to restore his honor by his own death, and he asks Jin to kill him in order to spare him the last agony, which promptly leads to a misunderstanding between Jay and Jin. The two battle each other to the top of Jay’s family temple and finally settle their differences just in time to face a spiritual boxer , whose son Jay has insulted in the course of the movie.

Pleased with Andrea's ability to ""follow my mind and keep his eyes fixed on the ultimate goal,"" Borgia selects Andrea to accomplish an intrigue: arrange the marriage of his widowed sister, Lucrezia , to Alfonso d'Este, the son of the Duke Ercole d'Este of Ferrara. By doing so, Borgia will remove Ferrara as an impediment to conquest of central Italy. In being selected, however, Andrea earns the enmity of Don Esteban , an ambitious captain and rival. Andrea travels to Venice to sell some of his paintings to raise money for expenses. He meets the lovely Camilla di la Baglione , young wife of the elderly Count Marc Antonio Verano of Citta del Monte, and smitten with her, gallantly gives her a painting he was haggling to sell for 100 ducats. Soon after, an assassin attempts to kill Andrea, but he thwarts the attack and spares the assassin to learn who hired him: the Duke Ercole d'Este. He hires the assassin, Mario Belli , as part of his own entourage. Resuming the mission, Andrea stops to visit the farm of a blacksmith's widow, reputed to be hiding gold stolen by her bandit son. She is actually his mother , and he is in fact Andrea Zoppo, not the noble Orsini he pretends to be. The reunion is a rocky one, because the mother does not approve of her son's evil ways. Belli spies on them through a window. Andrea continues to Ferrara, where he succeeds in arranging the marriage by intimidating the duke and flattering Alfonso. Andrea's next mission, again chosen over Don Esteban, is as ambassador to Citta del Monte, with orders to help Borgia conquer the mountaintop city by spring, using a romantic conquest of Camilla to facilitate a ""correct"" elimination of the elderly count . Borgia secretly hires Belli to spy on Andrea and report if his loyalty wavers. Andrea learns that when the old count has a problem to solve, he climbs to a high precipice looking out over the landscape. Belli is delighted because it would make it easy to kill the count, but Andrea is moved by the older man's wisdom and love for his people. Camilla, despite her suspicions of Andrea, grows to admire his artistic soul as he paints her portrait. When Borgia, through Don Esteban, orders the count to allow passage of his army and to supply troops for it, the count defies him with the support of his people. Andrea changes sides to join his cause but Belli, a self-professed ""born traitor"", gives notice to Andrea and returns to Borgia. The count reveals to Andrea that he married Camilla only to protect her after her father died, and has treated her as his own daughter. He is mortally wounded in an ambush and rout of the vanguard of Borgia's army and Andrea takes up the defense. After three months of repelling assaults, the city is at its last extremity. Don Esteban offers Camilla terms that are generous to her and her people, but would require her to surrender Andrea to Borgia. In love with Andrea, she rejects the terms, but Andrea gives himself up to Don Esteban at the price of putting the terms in writing. At a triumphal dinner with Camilla, who has begged him to spare Andrea's life, Borgia hauls in Andrea, tortured by Don Esteban, and exposes ""the noble Orsini"" as a peasant. He brings Andrea's mother to confirm it. Borgia orders his death by starvation but Belli, now a lieutenant in Borgia's service, protests and demands to gouge out Andrea's eyes in front of everyone and make him a blind beggar. However Belli has secretly remained loyal to Andrea and fakes the disfigurement, and Mother Zoppo takes her son home. After Borgia moves on to another campaign, Andrea and Belli plot to free the imprisoned Camilla and help the people retake their city. Belli aids Andrea in entering the castle to rescue Camilla, but the signal for the citizen uprising is given before they can make their escape. Andrea kills Don Esteban in single combat, but is about to be killed by another officer after Andrea stumbles over Esteban's corpse. However the officer, weary of killing for Borgia and an admirer of Andrea's, recognizes and spares him. The uprising sparks widespread resistance to Borgia, and after his fall, Andrea and Camilla are married."

He organizes an expedition of scientists and has them use an atomic-powered machine, capable of drilling through earth and stone, known as the Cyclotram, to find an underground environment where people could escape from nuclear obliteration. The expedition, consisting of Jim Bannon, Marilyn Nash, Otto Waldis, Tom Handley and Dick Cogan begins, after government funding has fallen through and they are bailed out at the last minute with private financing from a newspaper heir Bruce Kellogg, who insists on going with them as a lark. Romantic rivalry develops between Bannon and Kellogg for Nash, and two lives are lost to perils of the expedition, but in the end, the scientists accomplish their goal and find an enormous expanse with plentiful air, its own ocean and phosphorus light. However, the lab rabbits they have brought with them give birth to dead rabbits. Ms Nash discovers through an autopsy that the underground world has rendered the rabbits, and hence any other life form sterile. Dr Morley is depressed by the news and when an underground volcano erupts he doesn't enter the cyclotram and perishes. The survivors enter the underground sea and find themselves rising up to the surface of the upper world in the ocean, fortunately near a tropical island. Many of the plot elements seem to have been reused in The Core.

Investigators find over 800 videotapes shot by the killer which present a visual record of his murders in all their horrifying details. Both state and federal law enforcement teams sift through the gruesome images, looking for clues of his identity, the identity of his victims, and where he could have gone. Repeated viewings of the materials reveal little beyond the terrible facts of the crimes, and as the authorities comb through the madman's images, they find the tapes have had a disquieting effect on them. The killer does not only capture the murders themselves, but the abductions, tortures and postmortem mutilations of his victims  all the while never allowing himself to be shown on film unless entirely disguised. Because the killer numbered the video tapes in order, investigators are able to determine that he started with the most vulnerable of victims: an 8 year old named Jennifer Gorman is abducted while playing in her front yard. After the success of his first abduction and murder, the killer becomes less impulsive in his crimes. Carefully selecting the area in which he will strike next, he convinces a couple, the Andersons, that his car has broken down and they agree to give him a ride to a local gas station for aid. On the way, he clubs the male in the head and subdues the female using a cloth doused in a chemical solution while filming her face in close up. Investigators understand this would have taken considerable practice to achieve. The tape shows that the killer performed a C-section on the female, placing the severed head of her husband inside her womb before sewing her up again to later rouse her from unconsciousness and film her reaction. In the process of investigating the Andersons' disappearance, they come to realise the level of mutilation the killer is capable of, as well as his degree of premeditation. The killer made himself known in the CCTV footage of another gas station some time before the Andersons' abduction and murder, using sign language to give clues where he intends to dispose of one of the bodies. It is then shown that the killer is stalking his next victim, the teenage Cheryl Dempsey. Taking advantage that she is alone with her boyfriend , he enters her house. After secretly walking through the house he places the camera where it cannot be seen and hides in a closet until he is ready to attack. Although he abducts Cheryl, he murders and mutilates Tim, leaving his corpse at the scene. It is only after the discovery of the tapes it becomes clear that this crime scene has been carefully arranged in order to obscure possible psychological profiling. Rather than killing Cheryl, he imprisons her in his basement, abusing her sexually, physically and psychologically as his ""slave"", a name he beats her into accepting as her new one. Cheryl's mother, Victoria Dempsey, appeals to her kidnapper in a televised statement. He then goes to see her, offering to help in finding Cheryl while filming her response. It dawns on Victoria that she is confronted with the man that has abducted her daughter, he merely chuckles and runs away while she is paralyzed with shock. At this point the killer changes his modus operandi and begins targeting prostitutes while posing as a police officer. In his video record we are shown that in some cases he does not kill his victim directly, instead forcing Cheryl  to kill them. Because of the location in which he dumps the bodies and the level of mutilation they have suffered, the press now dub him ""The Water Street Butcher"". Forensic investigations discover several of the bodies are found to have the same sperm secretions. Using Ted Bundy's advice on a previous series of murders, authorities come to realize that the killer might indulge in necrophilia with his victims and should stake out areas where they find ""fresh bodies"" instead of making the discovery public. This is impossible as they can never find a fresh enough corpse. Investigating one of the victims' apartments, police find fingerprints and saliva on an unwashed glass leading them to arrest former police officer James Foley. Because Foley has a history of visiting prostitutes, no alibi on the dates of the abductions, various evidence found within Foley's car, eye witness statements and matching sperm samples, he is convicted as The Water Street Butcher. Foley continues to plead his innocence and refuses to make any deals; he is sentenced to death in Pennsylvania. A few days after James' execution by lethal injection, one of the leading investigators finds a map in his mailbox letting him know they have ""missed one"" and the location of a new body. It becomes clear that the real killer had taken James Foley's sperm from a fertility clinic and meticulously framed him . Foley is exonerated of the murders on September 12th. Because of the close date to the 9/11 attacks, this goes unrecognized by the general public. The ever changing nature and variation of the murders means every psychological profile is contradicting. The Water Street murders continue. Investigators trace the location of his house by records from a downloaded map of the area where one of the abductions takes place and raid the location. They find the house to be so clean that there are no fingerprints anywhere and no clues to the killer's identity. Along with the discovery of over 800 numbered video cassettes capturing several thousand hours chronicling his sadism, numerous dead bodies buried in the back yard , they find Cheryl Dempsey still alive, over a decade after her original abduction. She has been mentally abused to such an extent that she self harms and tortures herself in secret. Cheryl gives an interview where she says she believes her captor loves her and will return shortly to collect her. Soon after the interview, she commits suicide and in a note states her undying love for her ""master"". Not long after Cheryl is buried, her remains are mysteriously dug up and disappear. Although only 27 of the cataloged videos are missing, numerous investigating officers are unable to find even the smallest hint as to the identity of the real Water Street Butcher. The tapes themselves become an essential part of the training for anyone learning criminal psychology. The Water Street murders cease and the case remains open, with authorities stating they will be keeping a close eye on places where the ""documentary"" will be aired as they believe the ego of the killer will not allow him to miss watching it. In one last glimpse of the killer's sadistic nature, after the credits, a clip is shown of the face of one of his bound victims in close up. The killer taunts her by saying that he will make her a deal: he will release her unharmed if she does not blink. After a period of prolonged hyperventilation, the film ends as her eyes close."

All of this changes as the two Elders are caught in the cross fire of a gang shooting. Just prior to the shooting, the targets of the attack, a group of thugs had intimidated the missionaries, but despite this, after the attack, Elder Lozano helps save the life of Carl , one of the shot men. Carl asks for last rites, but Lozano explains that he is not Catholic and doesn't do that, but tells him that if he lives, he will be spiritually saved. To stop the bleeding, Elder Lozano uses his shirt revealing several tattoos and healed wounds presumably caused by gang violence. Elder Farrell is taken back by the revelation that his companion had such a violent past. Not wanting to discuss it, Lozano states that he made a better convert than he did a missionary, regretting he was not more effective in his efforts, and his lack of enthusiasm toward his task. After Carl is released from the hospital he tracks down Lozano at a Santa Monica beach where the missionaries in the area play basketball on their day off. He thanks him for saving his life, and noticing a copy of the Book of Mormon, is offered a copy and the phone number of the Elders. On their way home the Elders notice a man unconscious beside a dumpster. This man, later identified as Louis , has been preaching sermons to no one in particular on the street outside of the apartment of the missionaries. Against Farrell's better judgment, and the missionary rule of not allowing non-missionaries in their residence, he agrees to take the homeless man back to their apartment when Lozano tells him, they can ""keep the rules or keep the commandments"". The phone rings late in the night. It is Carl asking to meet with the missionaries. The next morning they meet Carl at the bleachers of the basketball court. He tells them he has been reading the Bible and the Book of Mormon, and wants to be baptized. When the Elders learn that he wants to be baptized that day, they agree to teach him the standard discussions before the end of the week and schedule the baptism for a few days later. In the meantime, their neighbor, Holly , is asked by the missionaries to watch the old man in their absence, giving her a key to their apartment. When they come home, they find Holly giving Louis a haircut and cleaning him up. The four have dinner together in the Elder's apartment and Louis tells of how he lost his congregation due to a love for liquor. For the next few days, the four continue to eat together on the roof of the building, as it is against the rules to have a female in their apartment. Elder Farrell learns from Holly that she is an actress, but that in her struggle to make it in Hollywood, she did two adult movies. Because of this, her family has disowned her, and she laments the choice she has made. She continues to call her family every week and leave a message that is never returned. Farrell tells her that God will never stop loving her no matter what she has done. At a local ward luau, Carl is interviewed by another Elder for baptism, and is told a story from the Book of Mormon. The story is of Ammon, a missionary, who teaches a group of people that decides to give up their weapons and bury them deep in the ground, vowing never to use them again. As Carl's baptism comes closer, his younger brother, Rob  feels like Carl needs to ""be a man"" and take revenge for the death of Carl's friend. Carl tells Rob that he is being a man by giving up his violent ways. That night, Carl buries his guns and knives in his backyard. The next day, Carl is baptized by Elder Lozano in the Pacific Ocean with his grandmother May , brother, and the other missionaries watching from the shore. The next day, Carl and his grandmother May attend church, where Carl is confirmed a member of the church by the laying on of hands. At the same time, his brother, Rob, goes to the Hispanic gang territory seeking revenge. The gang corners him, stabbing him to death. When Carl and May return from church, they are told the news. Immediately, Carl digs up his weapons and, with his gang, goes looking for the other gang leader. They drive all night, and finally, the next day, they run him down in a park with their car, breaking his leg. Carl holds a gun to his head, but he is conflicted, backs off, and walks away. Another gang member shoots the leader and Carl is distraught. That night he returns to the ocean where he was baptized and throws his gun and magazine into the water. Meanwhile, Louis finds an old church for sale and asks the owner, a widow, if he can preach at the church, and she can still own it. Back at the Elder's apartment, Elder Lozano wakes up to find that Elder Farrell is not in his bed. He looks across the balcony, and sees the lights on in Holly's apartment. He knocks on her door but there is no answer. He returns to his apartment, and is about to call the mission president, when Louis, sleeping on the floor, says ""He's a good kid. Have faith in him."" The next day, Elder Farrell is asleep in his bed, but when they wake up, there is tension in the air. Farrell eventually breaks down, crying. He knows he will be sent home for his indiscretion. The mission president is called. A church van comes to take him home and drop off a new Elder. Holly at first doesn't understand and thinks she can see ""Scott"" but soon realizes that Elder Farrell has done something with the same ramifications that she had done in her life. She returns to her apartment. When Elder Lozano calls Elder Farrell from the bathroom, Farrell does not respond. After kicking down the door, Farrell is found in the bathtub with his wrists slashed. The Elders rush him into the van and take him to the hospital. Holly finally realizes just how serious things have become. She goes to the hospital and talks to Farrell as he recovers, telling him the same thing he told her: God will love you no matter what you have done. Later, Elder Farrell, now in casual attire, is back in his apartment packing his things. His mother has flown out to take him home; his father didn't come. His mother hugs him as he cries uncontrollably. As he leave his apartment, he is greeted by Louis, Elder Lozano, the rest of the missionaries, Carl, May, and the mission president. Holly comes down from her apartment as well. Elder Farrell is drawn toward a ""living Nativity"" that is on display nearby.

Above Jerry drops a vase on his head. The crashing causes Mammy Two Shoes to throw Tom out of the house for a forty-year sentence. He then crashes into a mop and washcrate, giving him the Great Sphinx of Giza look, with some pyramids. Jerry teases Tom from inside and puts a ""For Rent"" sign outside his mouse hole. Jerry is having a lot of fun for some time without Tom, but soon becomes lonely. A voice asks Jerry, ""You never thought you'd miss that cat, did you?"" Jerry shakes his head. ""Feelin' kind of lonesome?"" Jerry nods. ""Look at him. You can't live with him, but there's no fun without him. You know, you could get that guy back in here though, if you really wanted to. Couldn't ya?"" Jerry thinks about it and then smiles. Tom is sitting outside the house, feeling sorry for himself. Jerry whistles at him and waves a hanky of truce. Jerry makes a deal with Tom to get him back in the house. Mammy is doing her dishes in the kitchen and singing. She continues working until Jerry pulls and snaps her sock. Jerry makes faces at her and she climbs on a stool, scared. Jerry continues by trying to shake her off the stool, but shakes off all sorts of accessories, a blade, and then Mammy's dress, which she promptly pulls back up. Jerry then grabs the blade and cuts the leg off the stool. Mammy screams and falls with a big crash, and she calls to Tom. Tom grabs a curtain, using it as a cape, and chases Jerry behind another curtain. Fighting sounds are heard, but Tom and Jerry are playing patty-cake and both yelping in ""pain"" to make it sound convincing. Jerry emerges from the fake fight and runs back into the kitchen, passing the stove he spies Mammy cowering on top of the cooker. The mouse turns on the burner underneath Mammy, causing her to jump to the ceiling, shrieking. Jerry runs past the fridge and as Tom runs by, he rips a drumstick off of a chicken. He chases Jerry behind a wall with the drumstick in his hands , and together they take turns eating it. The fake chase continues with Jerry running into the cupboard and choking the cat. A lot of banging sounds are heard, but Tom and Jerry are using the pots and pans as a drum set. Tom and Jerry quickly close the cupboard again. They come out of the cupboard and stage a sword fight with a knife and a fork as weapons. Tom then grabs a meat cleaver and starts to chop at Jerry. Tom ends up chopping the leg of a table, the bottom of a curtain, slicing a table in half, and cutting an apple on top of Jerry's head in half. Jerry notices that the last cut was pretty close to his head, and ensures the fight is not for real. The chase returns to staged mode. Tom chases Jerry around Mammy, who is standing on a chair holding a broom and clumsily hitting the cat three times before an irate Tom takes the broom and snaps it over his knee. Tom then hands the broken broom back to the humiliated housemaid. Jerry then runs under the carpet and Mammy tries to swat the mouse. Jerry escapes and Tom puts a tomato under the carpet, traps it and pretends to Mammy that this is Jerry. Mammy hits the tomato and Tom looks under the carpet. He then reacts as if it's the worst thing he's ever seen, laying down flowers and crying. Tom even blows his nose on the hem of Mammy's frilly apron. He then take the flowers oan and holds it down like a hat. Soon Tom has a napkin around his neck ready to receive his reward for taking care of Jerry: A lemon meringue pie. Jerry shows up with a napkin around his neck as well. Jerry takes a small bite of the pie and is about to dive in and enjoy it, but Tom pulls the pie away for himself. He pushes Jerry away and snaps his fingers at him. Before Tom can enjoy the entire pie, Jerry kicks him and Tom lands face first into it.

Jerry hides under a chair and Tom runs under it, but gets smacked on the bottom with a board from Jerry. Jerry's mousehole is then mined with dynamite, but unknowingly for Tom, Jerry has lit another firework under him, and both explode. Tom angrily continues the pursuit until Jerry offers him a fireplace shovel to hit him with. Tom misses several times and Jerry holds the tool down until Tom pulls on it so hard he hits himself when Jerry flees. Tom jumps into Jerry's hole, but his lips are ruffled and Tom has to pull himself out. Tom is tired of the chase and searches in the Yellow Pages for an exterminator. He finds one: Ajax Mouse Exterminators. One Call - That's All. Tom calls the company up impersonating as Mammy Two Shoes to come over. Butch arrives within seconds, washes his hands and goes to work. He paints a steel nut two shades of yellow so it looks like cheese, and tops it off with a blast of ""Essence of Cheese"". Satisfied, Butch rolls it into Jerry's hole. Jerry, suspicious, smells the nut. Since it smells like cheese, Jerry gobbles it. Butch then attracts Jerry with a magnet, trapping the mouse. Butch pulls out an axe and then holds Jerry down while he attempts to cleave the mouse in two, but Tom, scared of seeing the deed, turns away, allowing Jerry to substitute Tom's tail. Tom screams in pain and the 2 vs. 1 chase begins. Jerry runs into his hole and Butch pins him to a wall inside the hole with a corkscrew. With nowhere to go, Jerry touches two electric wires to the corkscrew, causing it to backfire onto Butch. The next scene shows the two cats attempt to kill the mouse with poison gas. Jerry walks out with a gas mask on; the two cats are puzzled, but don't figure out his identity. Jerry salutes and the cats salute as if to say ""Good day!"" Tom returns to pumping gas, but Butch has deduced the little creature must be Jerry. He slaps Tom and points to Jerry removing his mask, taunting the cats and running off. Both cats chase him one behind the other, but fall victim to Jerry placing an iron in their path such that Tom falls into Butch's mouth. Jerry hides in another mousehole and the two cats resort to prying up the entire wall. Jerry has a hammer and slams Tom's foot, causing him to lose grip  and Butch's fingers to be crushed . Jerry plays ""Yankee Doodle"" on the eight digits and Butch releases them. All six of the main fingers are red, and his fingernails pop out, letting out steam, making a train whistle sound. Butch instructs Tom to keep quiet and hands him a sledgehammer while he sneaks in through a grate and chases Jerry through the walls of the house, doing significant damage. Jerry pops out of the hole and Tom swings as instructed, only to find Butch's head replaced it soon after. Butch pops out of the hole in the floor and a bump rises on his head such that his hat hangs on it. Butch lights a bomb and the cats hide. Jerry sees it and throws it back. The cats and the mouse play Hot Potato with the bomb until Butch's hat falls off his head and it is mixed up. Jerry, instead of getting the bomb as intended, gets the hat, and Butch has the bomb on top of his head. Puzzled as to why Jerry isn't planting the bomb on Butch again, the cats look up, and then the bomb explodes. Jerry runs into one hole and comes out the other to find Butch on that side, then comes back out the other and finds Tom on that side. The two cats both grope and feel Jerry at the same time and grab for him just as the mouse jumps, leaving the two cats with hands held . Both cats think they have Jerry and yank the other cat into the wall several times. Butch then pokes at Tom with a broom and Tom proceeds to pull Butch through the entire wall, demolishing it, all with the false impression that their hands are latched on to Jerry. Tom slaps the pile of brick and rock with a board until he sees an opening. He digs through the pile and finds.....Butch's hat, with a corner missing. As Tom tries to find Jerry in the hat, Butch revives and replaces the hat as he draws himself up, incensed. Tom makes an ""oops!"" face, but Butch marks out the ""MOUSE"" in ""MOUSE EXTERMINATOR"" on his bag and replaces it with ""CAT"". Tom says ""C,A,T. Cat"". Then he points to himself and gulps. Butch gets a shotgun and threatens Tom who runs away to the window as Butch runs after him and shoots him as the cartoon fades out."

During the show, after the cylinder is randomly turned, the six will fire the gun one by one pointed at their head, without intermediate extra turning of the cylinder, until one is killed. Thus this will happen anyway. At first the idea is to go give all six contestants $1,000,000 each, but, while there are more applicants at the auditions than expected, they are suicidal people. This is not desired, the contestants should want to live; therefore the prize is raised to $5,000,000 each for the surviving contestants, while the family of the killed contestant does not get any prize. As the TV Executive struggles to overcome the challenges by the Federal Communications Commission, her network, and the show's advertisers, a documentary filmmaker  films every detail of her glamorous, high powered life. The documentary filmmaker becomes involved in the making of the show by creating biographical segments about the contestants, who are Byron ([[Rob Brown , a young, struggling writer; Brad , extreme sports star; Rick , a man who had to spend much on medical bills for his young son and is now trying to save his family's farm; Jewel , an aspiring actress; Abalone , a former super model turned performance artist; and Pablo , a young gay Mexican immigrant determined to help his family . Jewel is first, Pablo next, both are unharmed. Next is Abalone; before pulling the trigger with the gun pointed at herself she does a performance in which she frightens others by pointing the gun at them; she is also unharmed, but plays falling dead. The fourth is Byron, also unharmed. Brad is fifth and kills himself. Katy is shocked and feels guilty, and goes to the bathroom to throw up. The body is quickly removed off-camera. Rick, who would be sixth wins the prize without having to pull the trigger. After that, during the after-show press gang, a man comes forward with another gun and kills Katy. The network claims the murder is unrelated to the theme of the show. Apart from the murder the show is a success. It has become an annual broadcast.

Steven smuggles the chimp into the UBC building when he is being shown various movies to show, and watches as the chimp gives his vote from the camera room. However his first attempt proves unsuccessful as the executives do not agree with Steven's  prediction that a movie named ""Devil Dan"" will draw large audiences, so Post has to secretly enter UBC's footage room to switch the films, causing the executives to realize Steven was right in the first place when Devil Dan propels UBC to first place in the ratings war. Post successfully masks the chimp's abilities as his own and rises to vice president of UBC, now the top rated area network. However, this also creates suspicion and resentment among UBC executives, mainly because they believe Post is too young to merit the title of vice president. Their resentment reaches a breaking point at a television award ceremony where Steven Post receives the title of ""Television's Man of the Year"" and the emcee mistakenly identifies Post as the president of UBC. Fearing that Post's seemingly miraculous abilities will make their own jobs unnecessary, network executives E. J. Crampton  and Francis X. Wilbanks ([[Joe Flynn  attempt to discover his secret to success. One toady sees a bunch of bananas in Post's apartment, which leads to a humorous scene where the executives are seen eating bananas as they believe an idea that a New Guinea tribe considered bananas to be brain food. The flunky also hears sounds coming from Post's closet, and believes he is holding a hostage, which serves to intensify the surveillance of Post and his new luxury apartment. Using a spyglass to peer through his apartment window at night, the toady discovers the chimpanzee watching television with Post. Upon spying the chimp going to the refrigerator for a beer during the commercial break, the executives realize the chimpanzee's true abilities. Fearing the revelation that America's favorite TV programs were being picked by a primate would spell the end of television, the executives decide to steal the chimpanzee and return it to the jungle. Wilbanks and his chauffeur, Albert Mertons  venture out a narrow ledge in an attempt to snatch the chimp out of Post's apartment in his absence. The plan goes awry and the duo become stranded on the ledge until the police, fire department, and a Catholic priest arrive, mistaking their break in for a potential suicide. As a last-ditch effort, the network offers Post $1 million in exchange for the chimp, which he ultimately accepts. Jennifer becomes disenchanted with him when she finds out he sold her pet for money without her consent and breaks off their relationship. She also does not believe her chimpanzee should be released into the wild. Meanwhile, executives from every studio and camera crews crowd a cargo plane soaring over the jungle, as they prepare to parachute the chimp into an unexplored section of the Amazon; but before arriving at the intended disembarkation point, the stubborn chimpanzee, not wanting to be sent into the wild, pulls a lever opening an emergency hatch which sucks all the executives out of the plane, causing them to parachute into the jungle instead. Albert Mertons, who is now more sympathetic to Jennifer's feelings, reveals to Steven that the chimp outsmarted the executives and is now enroute back to the United States. Post uses this opportunity to refund the $1 million for the chimp. Post comments that UBC is going to need the money now in order to fund a search party for Wilbanks and the other executives. Jennifer and Steven have not only rekindled their relationship, but are now married and set off on their honeymoon with the chimpanzee in tow as their pet. The final scenes shows the Posts on an expressway which pans out in a wide scene, while a radio announcement says that Post has just married and resigned his vice presidency of UBC, but many people are wishing him well in his future endeavors."

Su-Wan is in her second year at university while Ji-Hoon is still in the process of repeating his third year of high school. Su-Wan’s mother works in their family business, selling fried chicken. To help out, Su-Wan earns money by tutoring other children, but often gets fired after hitting the students. Her mother has a rich friend with a son in need of a tutor. The friend, Kim Ji-Hoon’s mother, wants a tutor that will make her son study so that he can pass his exams. This salary is able to pay for an entire semester  of Su-Wan’s college education. Ji-Hoon is always able to attract the girls and draw attention through his love of fighting. He fought at his new high school, Surim High School and managed to offend Jong-Seo Lee, the leader of the triad group at Surim. He was able to attract his girlfriend, Ho-Gyung Yan, through his fighting. He had problems with everyone. Including the entire gang at his high school, he beat up a member of another gang after they took things from his little brother. Besides studying, Ji-Hoon is actually fairly well rounded. As a child, Ji-Hoon was sent to America to study abroad. Because of his parents' decision, the relationship between them and Ji-Hoon becomes strained. Ji-Hoon’s Father, Kim Bong-Man is threatening to send him back to the USA if he continues to get into trouble with fighting and bad grades. To avoid being sent back to America, Ji-Hoon needs to get at least a 50% on the upcoming mid-term exams. The only problem is that his usual average mark was much lower than that. Will he make it? Yes, he manages to do it. At the end of the term, he barely ends up with a passing grade , but passing nonetheless. As a result from a bet that the two, Ji-Hoon and Su-Wan, Su-Wan must dance in front of a crowd during a festival that was taking place. While embarrassed and shy at first, she eventually gets really into dancing and so does the audience. Ji-Hoon is starting to really like Su-Wan at this point and is angry when he sees all of the guys watching her and running up to the stage. Near this point is also when Su-Wan’s boyfriend comes back home. When spying on the couple, Ji-Hoon learns that Su-Wan’s boyfriend is breaking up with her. The next day, Ji-Hoon shows up at his house and beats him up for leaving her. Later, however, he finds out that the reason that he was leaving Su-Wan was because he was becoming a priest. After the service, Ji-Hoon lets Su-Wan beat him up for a little bit. Once she settles down, he decides to take her sky sailing. This is when Ji-Hoon decides to tell Su-Wan that he likes her. Su-Wan does not know how to respond and pretends she cannot hear him. Later on, they go to an amusement park. Just when Ji-Hoon is about to give Su-Wan a present, Su-Wan sees her close friend at the park with her boyfriend.

This makes Ji-Hoon mad and he throws her present into the fountain and leaves. Eventually, all of Ji-Hoon’s fighting catches up with him. Near the end of the movie, Ji-Hoon has to deal with all of the problems that have been building up. First, his girlfriend is mad and is making him choose between her and Su-Wan. Once he chooses Su-Wan, he isn’t finished. He still needs to deal with the high school gang and the real gang members.

A number of otherwise decent young men are selected based on a number of traits viewed as exploitable by the recruiters : illiterate, anti-communist, young and male, drawing comparisons to the Cambodian torturers at Tuol Sleng, many of whom were under 19 years old. The film also interviews Michalis Petrou, a conscript who served in the Military Police and was trained to become one of the most notorious torturers of the EAT-ESA. Petrou's testimony reveals that the training methods themselves were brutal and often torturous and was viewed as a necessity to ensure the robotic and brutal obedience of the trainees. During the dramatic recreation of the training camps, the directors draw parallels to modern military recruit trainings and the methods used in the training of soldiers.

What she doesn't realise though is that the kung-fu skills she thinks will protect her are merely a pretence, cleverly engineered to boost her ego by her over-protective father. It isn't too long into her misadventure that the formerly hermitic Si Si discovers that the world outside is far from being the world of chivalry that she expected and there are people practically lining up to take advantage of her. Not too far behind her is Yang Fan who is keen to save his fiancée more for the reward offered by her father than any feelings of affection for her.

The task involves taking the fabled 'Teardrop Sword' down into the martial world and solving the petty squabbles of a few supremely skilled individuals, while also deciding the fate of the seemingly cursed weapon. Kao takes his master's words on board, descends from his mountain retreat and prepares to meet the weird and wonderful pugilists he has heard so much about. Kao's arrival in town is noticed by the so-called 'Unbeatable' Sze-ma Chao-chun and his fiendishly intelligent aide Zhou who decide to keep a close eye on the stranger as they prepare to host a lavish ceremony. Unfortunately for Sze-ma, the celebration is disrupted by an assassination that leaves the whole of his clan rocked by the vicious attack. Kao insists that he has no involvement in the murder, but is happy to side with Sze-ma's long-time enemy Chu Meng of 'Braveheart Hall' when the rival clan leader is ambushed by a troop of killers. Though the histories of both swordsmen is familiar to Kao thanks to his master's instruction, he is less sure of the enigmatic killer who continues to appear during the most intriguing moments.

Even after giving up her job as the town schoolteacher, Missie has found running the ranch on her own overwhelming, so she has resigned herself to letting her son Jeff and his new bride take control of it jointly with her brothers Aaron and Arnie. Missie and her ten-year-old son Mattie travel back to her hometown to live near the farm of her parents, Clark and Marty Davis. She goes back to teaching school. At her first Sunday service, Missie and Mattie learn from the attractive—and single— Pastor Joe that an “Orphan Train” with homeless children in need of good homes will soon arrive from the Children’s Aid Society of New York. Outside the church, Clark introduces Missie to sharp-tongued biddy Mrs. Pettis, who disdains the orphans as ""ragamuffins."" At the same time, Missie catches the eye of a passing horseman: bachelor Sheriff Zach Tyler, another target of Mrs. Pettis’ vitriol. Claiming that Zach is not a godly man, Mrs. Pettis passes her judgment on him, implying he has a shameful past on the wrong side of the law. On her way to work, Missie passes the church just as the orphan distribution is underway. Although she is firmly determined not to grant Mattie’s request for a new sibling, she goes in—just in time to witness 14-year-old Belinda behaving belligerently toward the Pettises as they choose eight-year-old Jacob—looking on him as a farm worker rather than a son. Realizing that the lone orphan Belinda will be sent back to the foundling home in New York, Missie volunteers to adopt her. Unbeknownst to all, Belinda is Jacob’s sister. She kept this secret to prevent potential parents from breaking up siblings because they see her as ""too old"" to adopt. With Jacob secured in a home nearby, Belinda can figure out a way for them to flee; she believes that their father had given them up for adoption with the full intention of reuniting with them in the near future. She is so sure of this that she resists family life within the loving embrace of Missie, the Davises, Zach, and the community; she sneaks out of Missie’s home nightly to reassure Jacob that soon they will leave together. She becomes more determined after learning that the Pettises beat and starve him. Missie tells her mother Marty that she feels as if a voice inside told her to adopt Belinda, but she still can’t explain why. Perhaps, says Marty, “God knew that Belinda needed you. And maybe, for some reason you don’t understand yet, you need her.” Joe attempts to court Missie, but she resists, explaining she could never love anyone the way she loved her late husband. Missie then struggles to convince herself that although she is not in love with the sheriff, at least he would make a good marriage partner. While Missie discusses Belinda’s disturbing nocturnal disappearances with Zach, who has warmed her heart with his kindness toward the young girl, he states he has no faith in God if a child can suffer like Belinda. Later, Missie tells her mother she couldn’t love a man who didn’t share her faith. Zach and Missie discover Jacob’s plight, but are anguished that they can’t rescue him unless he exposes the Pettises, which he won’t out of fear of reprisal. While Missie and Zach appreciate their mutual desire to help the boy, they clash over how to save him. An angry Belinda berates them for their inability to help Jacob, claiming her father will soon come to their aid. Exasperated by Belinda’s rejection, Missie visits Marty, who reminds her that Missie once had trouble accepting Marty as her stepmother. Sagely, she tells Missie that “loving a child has nothing to do with giving birth” and “being a family is a choice, not necessarily something that just happens because you’re related by blood."" Belinda shows Missie a note written by her father. Belinda can’t read, but is sure the note explains how he’ll come back for her and Jacob. Missie then reads her the note, and Belinda learns that her father had actually left them at the orphanage for good. Later, Zach visits Missie at the school to explain his lack of faith: his fiancée was an innocent victim of murderous bank robbers. Missie then relates the story of her husband’s death, but adds that she still can’t be with a person who doesn’t share her faith. After Missie again fails to rescue Jacob, Belinda runs away with him into the stormy night. Everyone joins a desperate search for them. Amid the lightning-laden thunderstorm, Zach prays. He then hears a voice over the din and follows it to the abandoned mine where the children have sought shelter. Zach tells Missie it was God’s miracle that guided him in the wilderness, but as she later admits to her father, she doesn’t know how to “let go” of her late husband. Clark tells her love doesn’t die when a person passes away; it stays in a person's heart forever as she moves on to a new life with a new chance for happiness. Missie takes that chance by marrying Zach. They adopt Jacob as well and begin their lives as a family of five."

Pierre Gilieth comes out of house #25 looking very frightened, both Pierre Gilieth and Jacqueline accidentally collide while consumed in their distraction. Pierre Gilieth decides to walk away but leaves a streak of blood on Jacqueline's dress. Immediately, she realizes her dress is stained with blood and gasps. The film cuts to his peering through Venetian blinds in Barcelona. A detective follows him around town, while Pierre Gilieth meets with fellow Frenchmen in a bar, who pick his pocket to give his identifications away to the detective. When Pierre Gilieth finds out he tries to fight the thieves, but then refuses to have the police investigate the matter. Now at the end of his resources, having been rejected as a sailor on a merchant ship, he decides join the Spanish Foreign Legion on seeing a placard. The story is just before the Spanish Civil War, as the top of the placard reads ""Spanish Republic"" and ""Law of 17 July 1934"". Many of his fellow legionnaires have joined from destitution , but the Frenchman Fernando Lucas, played by Robert Le Vigan, has money not only for cigarettes but for barhopping. The other legionnaires are on the impression that the money is being sent by his mother and that the reason for his joining the legion was his desertion from the French Army. When Lucas drops his identification card which he quickly hides, Gilieth becomes wary that Lucas is hiding something. Gilieth follows the advice from his best friend Mulot , played by Raymond Aimos, to pick Lucas pocket in the night to read it; but fails.La Bandera info about Spanish Civil Wars - In Spanish accessed on 6 Nov 2010 Thus Gilieth feeds a newspaper clipping that he had been carrying around, announcing a 50,000 Franc reward for the capture of the culprit of the ""Crime of Rue St-Vincent"", to the swine in the base pen; hoping to get rid of the dark memories it brings. Lucas shows up and invites him to get a drink, but soon in the bar Lucas manages to anger Gilieth to the point of a fist fight. Shortly after, his unit of legionnaires the bandera is ready to move south, Gilieth is able to convince his captain, played by Pierre Renoir, to have Lucas transferred to another location on account of violation of personal space. Indeed, once the bandera departs, the detective from Barcelona comes and talks to Lucas. Mulot tries to cheer Gilieth up by bringing him to a local establishment with dancing girls. There he meets Aisha la Slaoui, a native who is portrayed by Annabella with marks on her forehead and chin; and immediately falls in love with her. He proposes to her as soon as he finds it appropriate, and their gypsy wedding ceremony involves their mutually making a cut in their mate's forearms and licking blood from it. Wishing to get away from Lucas, Gilieth plans to escape with her to her people in the south at Rabat, to become one of them; but still he needs to deal with Lucas. Until that time, he commands her to lie about her love for him and to entertain Lucas, even doing whatever he asks until he tells her who he really is. Lucas tries to get Aisha to leave Gilieth and be his woman. Gilieth confronts them together and tells Aisha to spit Lucas' in the eye; which she does. Then he tells Lucas to come with him outside to settle the matter like men. Aisha gives Lucas a coin, one of her jewelry pieces, to remember her by in case something happens to him. Lucas and Gilieth have a heated confrontation, where Lucas pulls out a knife and Gilieth is able to grasp Lucas' knife, but spares his life. There he admits that he killed a man, and says that he has given up his notion of escape with Aisha. Lucas tells Gilieth that he will surely be sleeping in jail that very night. Gilieth then shows two cartridges, telling him that he will first shoot Lucas and then himself during combat which will take place soon. As the men finish their talk, they hear the horn from their crew to take places. An unexpected uprising needs to be put down, for which task both Gilieth's and Lucas' banderas will be required. No legionnaire wants to volunteer to be one of the twenty-four who are to hold a small outpost in advance of the main force, until the captain says that he will command it himself. Immediately they all step forward, except Lucas, who pauses a moment. The sergeant then picks the first twelve on the left and on the right, which includes the main cast. The scene which follows has many of the stereotypes of this genre, of which the most important is that no Moroccan combatant is ever depicted; they are presented as supremely concealed snipers. Plot elements involve poisoned water and men who try to get to a safe supply but who only get shot for their valor. A fighter plane appears and several of the unit get shot either by ""friendly fire"" or, as the legionnaires surmise, by an enemy pilot. Captain Weller, sensing he only has a few minutes to live, tells Gilieth to take over. At this point Lucas informs Captain Weller, that he is a police spy as shown on his identification card. The captain is furious, and tells him to leave the men alone, and that as he is not a real legionnaire; he should depart if he should survive. Shortly after, the captain dies of heat stroke and exhaustion. The only two who remain are Gilieth and Lucas, as the main force charges up the hill, their machine guns blazing to sweep the enemy from their positions. Yet at this moment of victory, Gilieth gets shot by a sniper, leaving Lucas to answer the roll call of the twenty-four with ""Killed in action"" for all except for Gilieth, who was ""Promoted on the battlefield to corporal and killed in action"". He himself is ""Present"". Returning to Aisha, he gives her back her coin, saying that Gilieth died thinking about her."

What is briefed as a temporary ""training assignment"" in the United States becomes a flight halfway around the world to Germany for the C-54 Skymasters of the 19th, where the Soviets have blockaded Berlin in an attempt to force out the Allies by starving the city. Tech Sgt. Danny MacCullough , flight engineer of a C-54 nicknamed The White Hibiscus, is immediately ordered to fly with his crew from Frankfurt into Tempelhof Airport to deliver a load of coal. His friend Master Sgt. Hank Kowalski ([[Paul Douglas , a Ground-Control Approach operator, hitches a ride with them to his new station. Hank, a POW during World War II, resents the German people and goes out of his way to be rude and overbearing to them. Danny on the other hand is frustrated by not being able to leave the airport because of the necessity of quickly offloading and returning to Frankfort. Months later the crew of call sign ""Big Easy 37"" renames their airplane Der Schwarze Hibiscus because of the grimy soot that has accumulated in it from hauling coal. They become temporary celebrities on a mission when they are the 100,000th flight of ""Operation Vittles"" into Berlin. Danny is immediately enamored of Frederica Burkhardt , an attractive German war widow chosen to thank him on behalf of the women of Berlin. When a news correspondent covering the ceremony recruits Danny for a public relations stunt, Danny jumps at the opportunity as a means of getting a pass in Berlin and seeing Frederica again. During a tour of the city, Danny's uniform is accidentally covered with poster paste, forcing him to wear civilian working clothes while his uniform is cleaned. They meet Hank and his ""Schatze,"" the friendly and intelligent Gerda, at a night club, where Hank is rude to Frederica and treats Gerda as an inferior. Hank chances to see the former prison guard who tortured him as a POW and nearly beats him to death. Danny is able to stop Hank only by knocking him down and is mistaken for a German attacking Hank, is chased into the Russian Sector by MPs. Danny and Frederica barely escape back into the American Sector, where Hank is waiting for them at Frederica's apartment and has unexpectedly befriended her neighbor and Danny's friend, Herr Stieber . Danny falls in love with Frederica, despite learning from Hank that she lied to him about the backgrounds of her dead husband and father. She exploits Danny's feelings as an opportunity to go to America, where her German lover is living. When Danny receives notice that he is due to rotate back to the United States soon, he arranges to marry Frederica. Herr Stieber suspects duplicity in Frederica and intercepts a letter she has written to her German lover, confirming that she intends to divorce Danny back in the United States as soon as she legally can—and see her lover behind his back until that happens. In the meantime, Hank, in trying to teach Gerda the meaning of democracy , comes to see that he has been hypocritical in his own actions toward Germans. He begins treating Gerda as an equal and with affection as they meet Frederica to be witnesses to the wedding. When Danny arrives, he tells Fredrica she will have to wait a long time, if ever, to get to America. Herr Stieber has given Danny the letter she wrote. Hank reveals to Danny that he is not going home but has switched his temporary assignment in Berlin to permanent duty.

When the professor and his friend, American reporter John Lawrence , discover the creature, they help it when it is in distress and try to communicate with it, but fail. They leave, and the alien follows them home. A colleague of the professor, the unscrupulous and ambitious scientist Dr. Mears , discovers how to communicate with the creature and tries to get from it by force the formula for the metal the spaceship is made of. He shuts off the alien's breathing apparatus and leaves it for dead, telling the professor that communication was hopeless. Soon, Lawrence discovers that the alien is gone, as is the professor's daughter, Enid . Tommy, the village constable , reports that others from the village are missing as well. Lawrence takes the constable to the site where the spaceship has been, but it is no longer there. With more people now missing &ndash; including Mears &ndash; the phone lines dead and the village in a panic, they get word to Scotland Yard by using a heliograph to contact a passing freighter. When an Inspector  and sergeant fly in and are briefed on the situation, it is decided that the military must destroy the spaceship. Lawrence objects that doing so will also kill the people who are under the alien's control. With the mysterious planet due to reach its closest distance to the earth at midnight, Lawrence is given until 11:00 to rescue them. He sneaks up to the ship, and learns from Mears that the alien intends the ship to become a wireless relay station in advance of an invasion from its home planet, which is dying. Lawrence orders the enthralled villagers to leave and attacks the alien, shutting off its breathing apparatus, then escapes with Enid and the professor. Mears, however, returns to the ship and is killed when the military destroys the ship, just before the planet approaches and then recedes back into outer space.

Corinne informs her children that there has been tension between herself and her parents for many years, but does not elaborate and simply says they had cut her out of their lives for something she had done that they disapproved of. The children trust her, though Cathy is skeptical at times. Corinne's mother Olivia, a religious fanatic, takes her daughter and her children into her home, though with the harsh condition that the children must be sequestered away in a locked room so that her husband Malcolm  will never know of their existence. To that end, the children are shut up in one bedroom in the mansion, only with access to the mansion's attic via a secret stairway. It is on their first day there that the grandmother reveals the shocking truth: Corinne and her husband were really uncle and niece, making their love incestuous and their children the product of said incest. When Corrine finally returns to the children that night, she is forced to show the children that she has been savagely horsewhipped by her mother as a punishment for her incestuous relationship. Corinne admits to the children that she and their father were uncle and niece, and the children do not say anything but seem to accept it. Corinne tells the children that their confinement will only be for a short time: her father is deathly ill, and once she is able to convince him to secure her inheritance, when he dies they will be free. The film focuses on the children's ordeal as shut-ins and their clashes with the ultra-religious grandmother, who loathes the children due to their incestuous conception. The children struggle to survive, even as their mother's visits quickly taper off. In particular, Olivia becomes obsessed with Chris and Cathy, out of the warped belief that they have become lovers. Discovering them sleeping in the same bed one morning, the grandmother smashes Cathy's ballerina music box, given to her by her deceased father, and after she discovers the two innocently talking while Cathy is bathing, she calls them sinners. Chris manages to chase her out, but later on Olivia ambushes Cathy in the bedroom, locks Chris in the closet preceding the attic, and hacks off her hair with a pair of scissors. She then starves them for a week, and Chris is forced to feed Cory his own blood so he doesn't die of starvation. As time goes on, the children are often sick, especially the younger ones. Chris and Cathy manage to secretly remove the hinges from their locked door on a few occasions to sneak out of their room, and discover that their mother has been living a life of luxury as well as dating a young lawyer, Bart Winslow. She does eventually come to visit them again, and they confront her about leaving them there to suffer and ignoring them. Corinne is very defensive and acts insulted, cries that they are cruel to think that she is deliberately neglecting them, or enjoying life while they are locked up. She storms out. Shortly after, Cory becomes deathly ill. The children ask Olivia and Corinne to take Cory to the hospital, which they do, but later Corinne returns to inform them Cory has died. The children are devastated, but not long after they start to suspect that Olivia has been poisoning all of them when their pet mouse Fred is found dead after eating part of a cookie. Chris researches and concludes that Cory and Fred were killed via arsenic poisoning, mixed in the sugar on the cookies they are served with the breakfast. The remaining siblings decide to leave the attic once and for all. Chris sneaks out to steal money before they escape and discovers that their mother is planning to wed Bart Winslow at the mansion the next morning. Though upset, he suggests to Cathy they dress up in fancy clothes from the attic, and use the wedding as a cover to sneak out of the house. When Olivia secretly enters their bedroom the next day, hoping to catch them once more doing something ""evil"", Chris takes her by surprise and beats her unconscious with a bedpost.

They also find a copy of his will, which connects the final dots—Malcolm, still suspicious of his daughter, put a clause in his will which states that if it is ever revealed that she had children from her first marriage, she will be disinherited and lose all of her money. They realize that their mother was the one poisoning the cookies, not their grandmother. The children crash the wedding ceremony and expose their mother to the guests and the groom; Corinne refuses to acknowledge the children as her own or to admit to poisoning Cory. Cathy offers her an arsenic-coated cookie as a wedding present, and in fury tries to force her mother to eat it, chasing her out to a balcony, where after a brief struggle, Corinne falls and is killed when her veil is caught on a trellis, breaking her neck. Afterward, the children leave the mansion as their grandmother looks on with scorn; the narrator  explains that the children did manage to survive all by themselves although Carrie was 'never truly healthy'.

Fascist bosses gathered in Cremona  pick enthusiast militant Primo Arcovazzi  to take into custody professor Bonafe, a noted anti-fascist philosopher, from the rural location where he was confined in and to lead him to Rome . Equipped with a motorcycle-sidecar combination Arcovazzi picks up the professor and heads towards the Eternal City; along the way the couple wrecks its vehicle to avoid running over a girl  who turns out to be a confidence trickster and petty thief; and, after having scammed the professor out of 150 lire, she disappears. Without a mean of transportation Arcovazzi asks help to a truckload of Wehrmacht soldiers passing by, only to have his sidecar confiscated and to be made prisoner  by the German forces. Ending up in a Nazi-controlled jail the couple makes good its escape thanks to an allied air raid, donning German uniforms to pass unnoticed during the commotion but, while Arcovazzi is stealing a Schwimmwagen Bonafè tries to desert him. The following night the two men stop to sleep in a barn where they rejoin the thieving girl; she is afraid but they instead ask for her help to kill a chicken they managed to steal along the way. After having dined together the trio falls asleep; the girl wakes up first and leaves with all of Arcovazzi's and Bonafe's clothes and accessories . Depressed by the events Arcovazzi tries to ford a stream, confiding in the Schwimmwagen's noted amphibious qualities but, due to previous damage or his own ineptitude, the German car sinks. Reaching a village on foot Arcovazzi tries to ask for help at the local fascist party cell  where they only manage to find a couple of teenagers, armed and fanatized by fascist propaganda  who, doubting Arcovazzi's sincerity, shower him with questions only a true-blue fascist can answer. Arcovazzi's naive enthusiasm seems to finally pay off when he answer all of the boys' questions, but the last one leaves him in dire straits ; with the two kids' fingers on the trigger it's Bonafe  who comes to the rescue of his 'jailer', suggesting him the correct answer. Confiscating a tandem bicycle and a pistol Arcovazzi can resume his odissey, until the former bursts a tire. Forced on foot once again Arcovazzi decides to stop at Rocca Sabina, home of  nationalist poet Arcangelo Bardacci, whom he idolizes and whose writings  prompted him to become a fascist. Reaching the poet's house he's told by his wife that he went fighting with the Italian Army in Albania and died there. Bardacci however is still alive, having had a change of conscience, having embraced antifascism and biding his time hiding in the cellar until the regime he once endorsed finally collapses. Arcovazzi is offered hospitality in the poet's house, where Bonafe discovers the truth and is allowed to escape in exchange of a promise of rehabilitation for Bardacci once things settle down. Arcovazzi however manages to catch him once again, resuming the voyage towards Rome with his ""captive"". Catching a methane powered pullman seems to alleviate the journey's difficulties, but during one of the frequent stops , Bonafe escapes for the n-th time. Pursuing him Arcovazzi manages finally to recapture him, but the pullman is long gone...they finally manage to enter the outskirts of Rome in the dusk hours of early June, 1944. Unbeknown to them the Italian Capital has just been conquered by the Allies. Groups of GIs were stationed in the squares, celebrating their victory and preserving public order. The couple is at first oblivious to the fact and manage on the way to cross roads with the young girl once again: Arcovazzi demands his clothes back but she mockingly offers him something ""even better"", a full fascist ""Federale"" uniform. Having been promised the ""Federale"" rank if successful in his endeavor Arcovazzi eagerly accepts and dons the uniform on the spot, glowing in the regalia he so long dreamed for, while Bonafe scoffs his head. Passing along the deserted boulevards of Rome  they hear the laughs and jokes of a group of soldiers which Arcovazzi at first believes to be German, speaking only Italian and not being able to tell languages apart; the more cultured Bonafe points out that the men are speaking in English, prompting Arcovazzi to dismiss them as POWs . But the POWs seem to be a bit too loud and relaxed and, after some inquiry, Arcovazzi is horrified at the discovery that he is, actually, behind the enemy lines . The U.S. troops, however, treat him more as a curiosity than as an enemy, they cheer him and take pictures of him instead of shooting him on the spot . The reaction of Italian civilians, however, is wholly different; resenting the failures, the brutality and the empty boasting of fascism they throw themselves at him, menacing to lynch him; Bonafe, who during the whole odissey has grown oddly fond of him has to call on a partisan patrol to save Arcovazzi from the mob. The partisans, seeing his high-rank uniform, are however inclined to shoot Arcovazzi on the spot; seeing the spirits much too inflamed to be convinced otherwise Bonafe asks for a pistol and the dubious ""honour"" of shooting his former jailer himself. Leading the wannabe-""Federale"" behind a ruined wall he, throws the weapon away, helps Arcovazzi in removing the uniform which was about to seal his fate and lets him go."

The movie is basically a film noir, where a self-destructive, down-and-out investigator takes on a case that may be more than he can handle. Incorporating standard elements like a beautiful woman, excessive drinking and subtle voiceover, the piece is set up like a standard detective film. Later a science fiction angle, which is part conspiracy and part nouveau alchemy, is introduced. This component, to some degree, extends the common understanding of quantum physics. Within this framework the unbelievable is now possible and the story is set up for special effects and general creepiness. One final ingredient is comedy. Mostly situational, the laughs come from the somewhat uncommon characters thrown together in this extraordinary scenario. Rather than punchlines; reactions, comparisons and slapstick are used to ease the tension and create a more fun atmosphere. Not to be forgotten, this is first and foremost a horror movie. Where the film consists of a variety of different genre elements, Aversion is simply a suspenseful film of demonic possession.

She calls for Tom, who lazily wakes up and then acts instantly when he sees the mouse. Tom chases Jerry away from Mammy, but Jerry trips him. Jerry goes back to Mammy and rocks the stool up and down until Tom chases him again. Jerry then opens up a door and the ironing board, followed by the iron, fall on Tom's head. Tom catches Jerry trying to cut down the stool, and Jerry gives him the axe. Mammy urges Tom to hit Jerry, but misses and eventually he chops down the stool. Tom supports Mammy on his head, until he loses his balance. Jerry opens the door of the basement stairway. Tom goes through the doorway, with Mammy still on him, and crashes down into the basement causing several pieces of crockery to smash outside the door. Fed up with Tom's failure, Mammy retires him. She then calls in ""Lightning"", a bright ginger cat who lives up to his name as he rushes onto the scene and speedily kicks Jerry out of the house and into the dumpster. Tom then panics as Lightning speeds past him and flips him over, then Lightning kisses Mammy's hand. Mammy praises Lightning's etiquette and efficiency. Jerry tries to sneak back into the house, but Lightning kicks him out again. Lightning passes by Tom and twists him around, and dresses him up with a fake beard and a walking stick as Mammy advises him to ""take good care of poor old Uncle Tom...""  as she goes upstairs, leaving Lightning in charge. The cat then begins to show his true nature by raiding the fridge, until he drops a bottle of milk. This wakes up Mammy. Lightning then frames Tom by dumping the fridge contents at Tom's feet, stuffing leftovers into his hands and cramming Tom inside a watermelon. When Mammy enters Lightning nods Tom's head when she asks if he had been in the fridge. Lightning offers to throw Tom out of the house, and Tom is kicked into the dumpster, where he sees Jerry. As Lightning is set to kick him, Jerry just kicks himself out. Together, the duo plot to remove Lightning from the house for good. Later Tom and Jerry, armed with a magnet and iron, sneak into the house, and place the iron by a sleeping Lightning's mouth, and the magnet behind his rear. This causes Lightning to swallow the iron, waking him up. As Lightning chases after Jerry, Tom uses the magnet to attract the iron, and therefore pull Lightning back into his fist. Tom then tosses the magnet to Jerry, but Jerry is too light and is dragged along with Lightning until he runs into the iron and latches onto the magnet. Lightning grabs onto a piano leg and Tom, Jerry and Lightning begin a tug-of-war. The duo wins and Lightning is sent through the piano and into a wall, where a whole set of plates fall on the ginger cat. Mammy hears the chaos and enters the room, but soon Jerry starts to terrorise her again by shaking the stool she is standing on. She calls for Lightning, but Lightning is unable to come to the rescue, as Tom is controlling his movements behind the kitchen wall. Eventually, after praying that someone will help her, Mammy calls for Tom, who grabs Jerry and pretends to beat him up, but Tom and Jerry are actually hitting a pan with wooden sticks and rattling it. Tom helpfully kicks Lightning out of the house, but he breaks his foot after striking the iron as he kicks him. Later, Tom, with his broken foot wrapped in bandages, is given a nice pie from Mammy as a token of her gratitude, as well as an apology for her misunderstanding. Tom takes most of the pie, but leaves the remainder by his side for Jerry, who, using the magnet, brings the pie and dish to his hole, and happily tucks into his well-earned food."

The lander carries two astronauts, one of them a black male model, James Washington, specifically chosen to aid the President of the United States in her re-election . Upon landing on the Far side of the Moon they encounter the Nazis who have hidden there since 1945. Washington is taken captive and the other astronaut killed. Nazi scientist Doktor Richter investigates Washington and finds his smartphone. Although initially skeptical, he recognizes that its computing power outstrips all their technology combined. Moreover it serves perfectly as a control unit for space battleship Götterdämmerung. When he strives to demonstrate the completion of his Wunderwaffe to the current Führer, Wolfgang Kortzfleisch, the phone runs out of power. Nazi commander Klaus Adler, who is  chosen to mate with Earth specialist Renate Richter, Doktor Richter's daughter, offers to go to Earth to collect more phones. Adler takes a spacecraft to Earth, taking James with him, who has been bleached by Richter. Upon landing they find that Renate has stowed away and travelled with them. Meanwhile on Earth, the President of the United States has to tackle political issues; she desperately needs a miracle to ensure her re-election. Her aide, Vivian Wagner , introduces the Nazi couple to her. Adler and Richter go on to revamp the President's campaign Nazi-style, with apparent success, while the clueless Richter is unaware of Adler's ambition to become the next Führer and rule the world. After three months, Kortzfleisch seems to have figured out Adler's plan. He sends his armada  to Earth orbit. He himself lands on Earth and confronts Adler, but is consequently killed by him and Vivian. Adler declares himself the new Führer before he returns to orbit with Kortzfleisch's flying saucer. At the same time, Renate Richter comes across the now homeless Washington who makes her realise that terrestrial Nazis are not to her liking. The United Nations assemble to discuss the extra-terrestrial Nazi threat. The President is excited to finally have a war which will likely get her re-elected, and appoints Vivian Wagner as commander of the spacecraft USS George W. Bush, which orbits the Earth carrying nuclear weapons. As it turns out, most of the other nations have also developed armed spacecraft, and join in to defeat the invading Nazi armada. Back on Earth, Richter convinces Washington to come with her back to the Moon to stop Adler. They take Adler's flying saucer back to the Moon and to the Götterdämmerung, where Washington attempts to disable the engines while Renate goes looking for Adler. Meanwhile, the international spacecraft armada has destroyed the Swastika moonbase and is heading for the Götterdämmerung as well. In the final battle, Washington manages to disconnect the tablet device now controlling the Götterdämmerung while Richter takes out Adler. The spaceship crashes into the Moon, but not before Adler has taken out a considerable chunk of the Moon attempting to get a clear shot at the Earth. The U.S. President calls Wagner from the UN session, congratulating her on her victory. Wagner discloses she detected large tanks of Helium-3 on the Moon. This material would keep the United States independent of foreign power sources for a millennium. Consequently the U.S. president immediately lays claim to it. This enrages a white-haired UN member  who throws his shoe at her. All UN members join the following ""meeting hall battle"". This leads to an international turmoil and eventually even the international spacecraft of the hitherto allied nations start attacking each other. Richter meets up with Washington  in the damaged Swastika moonbase, where they embrace in front of Richter's flabbergasted former students and some adults who have fled there from other parts of the base. Richter states that ""[they] have a lotta work cut out for [them]"". The final moments of the film show the Earth, where missiles are causing nuclear explosions across the globe. At the very end of the credits, the planet Mars is revealed with a man-made satellite of undetermined origin in orbit."

The brothers have a loving relationship with each other, despite some strain from their father's unequal treatment of them. Both brothers are skilled in external martial arts, though their father disapproves of Cheng practicing kung fu when he should be studying. One day, a local bully with a nobleman father harasses the townsfolk, and Cheng fights, defeats, and humiliates him. That night, the bully and his partners in crime ambush Cheng and his brother, attempting to burn them with fireworks. The brothers turn the tables on the bully, but Cheng accidentally goes too far, inflicting permanent brain damage on the bully that renders him mentally disabled. The bully's father hires an assassin to murder Cheng and his family and friends. The assassin is a master of external martial arts. He murders Cheng's father, brother, and friends, and burns Cheng's home down, destroying the family fortune. Cheng escapes, but is left orphaned, homeless, penniless, and friendless. Cheng stumbles across a puppeteer  being assaulted by rival showmen. The puppeteer is successfully defending himself, but Cheng comes to his aid anyway and inadvertently destroys his booth by kicking one of the assailants into it. The puppeteer insists that Cheng pay for the damage. Cheng has no money, so he follows the puppeteer home to work off his debt. There, Cheng befriends the wine-loving, humorously eccentric puppeteer and his wife , but is sent away when he accidentally offends them. It is revealed that the assassin is mute and is the single father of a young boy who lives at a nursery because his father is unable to support him. Despite this, the assassin and his son deeply love each other. The assassin makes a wooden horse for his son, but the other children mock it for looking amateurish. The assassin's son boldly stands up for his father. Later, the assassin's son is kidnapped by street thugs, but is rescued and befriended by Cheng. Despite this, the assassin continues to hunt Cheng, determined to finish his job. The assassin ambushes Cheng and almost kills him, but Cheng escapes again and flees back to the puppeteer's house, where the puppeteer and his wife were regretting having sent Cheng away. When Cheng returns, the puppeteer reveals that he is a master of T'ai chi, and he trains Cheng to counter the assassin's hard style with soft. The nobleman who hired the assassin is about to have his birthday, and he contracts the puppeteer to give a performance at the celebrations. He demands an original performance, though, which the puppeteer doesn't have ready. Cheng comes to the rescue by using his physical skills to give an original performance. His costume prevents him from being recognized. After the performance, Cheng overhears the nobleman saying that he hired the assassin who murdered Cheng's family and friends and burned his home and fortune.

In the cargo hold, three Russians sit with a padlocked box. The co-pilot launches a gun fight that soon leads to the plane crashing and the death of all aboard. The setting changes to the United States' Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station in Antarctica. Newcomers have arrived, and others who are scheduled to leave are preparing to do so early because of a storm. They must depart before the onset of winter or remain for six months. Deputy U.S. Marshal Carrie Stetko  has been working in Antarctica for two years, since a betrayal by her partner in Miami that killed him and nearly killed her. She plans to retire after returning to the United States in two days. Stetko, her friend Doc , and pilot Delfy  fly to the remote Haworth Mesa to retrieve a discovered body. The dead man is Anton Weiss, one of a group of three scientists looking for meteorites. An autopsy finds evidence of murder by axe. A murder requires a federal investigation; Stetko considers sending the body to McMurdo Station to avoid spending another winter in Antarctica, but decides to continue the investigation. When Stetko goes to speak to one of the others at Vostok Station, she finds him dying from a neck wound and is herself attacked by a black-clad man with an axe. Stetko injures her hands in escaping, losing the wet skin of her fingers on the metal handle of a door. Later, she finds Robert Pryce , a UN security agent, examining the body of the second scientist. They conclude that the third, who is missing, must be the killer and set out to explore the group’s most recent research site. There, Stetko falls through the ice to find the old Russian cargo plane. Pryce and Delfy join her to investigate, and they realize that the locked box had been opened and six cylinders removed. Pryce reveals that it is possible that nuclear fuel of interest to arms traffickers may be in the cylinders. After nearly being trapped by a cave-in at the plane, Stetko must have her badly frostbitten fingers amputated by Doc. She then finds the missing scientist hiding in her office. He tells her that he and his two companions found the plane and took the canisters, but the killer has them now. Before Stetko can protect him he is killed, but Carrie captures his killer, Russell Haden . The base commander orders everyone to evacuate because of the murders. With Haden locked in the brig and the winter storm near, Stetko and Pryce search for the canisters. Haden, however, escapes as the storm, a ""whiteout"", hits. Able to navigate through the blinding snow only by the system of security ropes, Pryce and Stetko pursue Haden. Just as Haden is about to kill her, Pryce cuts Haden's rope, sending him to death in the storm. At the base, Stetko and Pryce open the bag Haden had been carrying to find that the missing canisters contain only jelly beans. Stetko checks the last departing plane's cargo manifest and learns that the bodies of the dead scientists were not aboard. She searches their body bags and notices that the stitching on Weiss's old wound matches the distinctive pattern on her amputated fingers. Stetko explores the body and finds several bags of large, uncut diamonds. Doc confesses that he was part of a diamond smuggling ring with the others before Haden killed the rest. He had hoped that the diamonds would make him wealthy outside Antarctica. When Doc tells Stetko he wants to see the aurora australis one last time, she allows him to walk outside to his death. Six months later, Stetko, Pryce, and Delfy have wintered at the facility. She transmits an email to her superior, rescinding her previous resignation and asking for a warmer location for her assignment."

Shortly thereafter, Kumar and Meena get married and return home to Bombay. Four years later, Meena's dad passes away after telling her something that he had hidden. Soon, Kumar notices that Meena does not accompany him to the stage any more, and excuses herself on the pretext of being ill. He finds clues that suggest that she is meeting somebody else on the sly. Suspicious, Kumar makes the excuse of going to Pune, and instead dons a beard and goes by the name of S.N. Sinha. He checks into a hotel, and writes his name in the hotel register. That night, he returns to his home, to find the door open, and before he can investigate anything, he hears a gunshot. Kumar runs into the room and finds Meena dead, shot in the neck. Enraged, he decides to call the police station, but realizes that he will be implicated in the murder - his fingerprints are on the gun, he is in disguise, and he is next to the body. Kumar returns to the hotel instead, and smokes a lot of cigarettes. The case is assigned to Inspector Ashok , and the next day, when Kumar ""returns"" to Bombay, Ashok observes that Kumar knows which room the body is, without being told by anyone. The coconut seller near Kumar's house says that he saw a bearded man in the area the night of the murder, and the owner of the hotel which Kumar had checked into calls the police, saying that a bearded man had checked into his hotel. The cigarettes that Kumar had smoked are recovered, and handed over to Ashok. When he visits Kumar at his house the next day, Kumar offers him the same brand of cigarette, rousing his suspicion. Soon, more clues surface, pointing at Kumar as the killer. In a fit of haste, Kumar decides to run away from the growing suspicion of Inspector Ashok. His friend, lawyer Jagmohan , says that he will now definitely be implicated as the murderer of Meena. Desperate, he finds a clue about the suspected killer from his home - a key with room number of a hotel. Kumar visits the room as a last attempt to clear things before he is caught. There, he meets Captain Rajesh who calms down him and tells him that none of them is the real killer. He tells Kumar that he is his wife's first husband, who was supposedly killed on the front, and how he wanted her to acquire their illegitimate child, Sarika, because she wouldn't be able to raise a child born out of wedlock. Captain Rajesh tells Kumar that whoever is the killer, was seen by Sarika because she was present in the room where Meena was murdered while both mother and daughter were playing and their activities being recorded by a video camera.

She finds his house, abandoned. He left a diary in which he addresses her specifically. In it he complains about darkness consuming the town, and horrible nightmares he is having, and implores Arletty to never, ever look for him. His letter tells her to talk to the owner of the art gallery, who sells his paintings. The gallery owner says he has none of her father's paintings, does not sell them, no one ever comes in looking to buy his works, and says he doesn't know where he went. He says Point Dune is 'an artist colony', and he only vaguely remembers her father . It is never clear if these are townspeople, or figures from his visions, or both. By chance, Arletty meets a Portuguese-American aristocrat Thom and his two extremely provocative, groupie-like female companions, Toni and Laura. They are drinking, smoking, and walking around in states of undress, except for the man. He always wears an ivory three piece suit, 24 hours a day. He is fascinated by the town, and the legend that a blood moon rises above it periodically, and darkness then consumes the town. Back at his motel, he is interviewing Charlie  a village idiot/'wino'-type character. He tape records his bizarre rants. Charlie speaks at length about 'the blood moon' and 'the dark stranger' and how he has lived through both. He says very soon it will be the 100 year anniversary of the first appearance of the 'dark stranger', he will return, the moon will turn red, and the town will be overrun with evil. He says the stranger's followers do not kill him as they think he is a harmless hobo—they let him sleep on the sidewalk undisturbed every night. Charlie warns Arletty about her father, he says he is 'one of them' now, and must be killed, but with fire, as only fire will do the job. Moments later he is murdered off screen. Thom tells Arletty he also went to the gallery, and saw one of her father's paintings in the window. The man and his women are kicked out of the motel, supposedly because the police questioned them about the wino, and it bothered the management . They all move in together, at Arletty's father's house. Each night at the house, strange things happen, shadows crawl about on the skylights, and Arletty reads more of the diary. In it, her father reveals his body temperature is 85 degrees. This proves he is dead, but thinking and moving about, and suggests the local vampires are fully sentient and aware of what they do, and only Arletty's father feels remorse and is actively fighting his 'condition'. Meanwhile, each night, creatures gather on the beach in front of bonfires, staring straight up at the moon. The locals call it 'The Waiting'. These 'vampires' will eat anything: dead vampires, dead people, live people, live animals, etc. Each day 'order' returns to Point Dune. These vampires are especially interested in eating Arletty, Thom, Toni, and Laura. First to die is Laura, devoured inside a Ralphs supermarket, in one of the film's two semi-famous scenes. Next to die is Toni, in the other semi-famous scene, she is literally devoured in a movie theater filled with blood red seats and greenish vampire-like creatures. These 'things' act like vampires, bite their victims necks, but then eat them like George Romero's zombies. The night Toni is eaten alive, Thom races downtown, realizing she is in danger. But he's too late. Things quickly get completely crazy as the 'blood moon' rises, every resident turns into a monster, and the titular Messiah of Evil - the dark stranger, a former minister, and a Donner Party survivor from the late 19th century turned vampire/cannibal, returns. He says he has come to lead his people up the coast and inland, to spread his 'religion'. Thom gets bitten on the neck, and then suddenly two policemen in riot gear drive up, and fire their guns into a swarm of townspeople/vampire/zombies; however one of them suddenly begins to bleed, causing his now-former partner to shoot him and flee. Undaunted, the undead cop shoots his former ally and he and the other vampire/zombies go to feast on his flesh. Thom drives to the beach house, but Arletty is half-crazed; she is cold, cannot feel pain, thinks she may be dead or un-dead...she even finds a bug crawling around in her mouth and immediately vomits up various beetles, mealworms and an anole. Startled by Thom, she stabs him with garden shears. Later bandaged up and ready to go, the two of them flee to the beach. It is swarming with the ersatz vampires. They swim out to the breakers. Thom drowns, but Arletty survives. Instead of being eaten, she is tied up, to be 'sacrificed to the Messiah'. Instead of killing her, he turns her loose, and tells her to spread word of his religious movement throughout California and the world. Of course, once she is freed Arletty tries to spread word of the menace and of his cult. This causes her to be locked up in an insane asylum. She is the woman seen dancing in the hallway at the beginning of the film. Each day, all day, she sits in the sun painting. But she says she is really waiting for, and dreading the day the Messiah and his followers come to her asylum, and she is taken away to live forever as his bride.

Mohan teaches literature and poetry at a nearby college. During one lesson about a nobleman who has fallen for a prostitute, he makes his feelings about dancing girls quite clear. Not long after, his mother, who is running a fever, falls down the stairs in their home and is unconscious. The doctor is called, injections are given, the neighbors all come crowding in, and much shaking of the head ensues, but she finally regains her senses long enough to say this. The doctor pronounces his judgment that with the medication, she will get better; but the packed-in neighbors are much more gloomy. They all file out, still muttering amongst themselves. One of the neighbors, Jeevan , has creditors hounding him, and he sees a little opportunity to make some money. He tells Mohan that he knows a girl who might be persuaded to pose as his fiancee for a few days, but her father will probably want money. Mohan of course is willing at this point to do anything and agrees to give Jeevan whatever he wants. Jeevan goes to see Champabai, a local tawaif. He negotiates a price with her for posing as Mohan’s fiancee for the evening. She puts on a demure sari and he takes her to see his mother and meet Mohan. His mother wakes up long enough to bless her before falling back into a deep sleep. Champa for her part is unimpressed by either mother or son and mocks them when she gets home. Jeevan gives her money, which is promptly pocketed by the brothel owner Lallubhai. The next day Mohan's mom asks to see “Rajani” again, and Mohan asks Jeevan to bring her again that evening—Jeevan has told Mohan that she is the daughter of a distant relative. In any case, Champa/Rajani is bowled over by the expensive jewelry that Mohan's mom shows her as the family bride-to-be. She decides to forgo her fee, to Jeevan’s dismay, in favor of pretending to have real feelings for Mohan until she can find an opportunity to steal it. She soon does, as one day Mohan's mom gives her the bridal sari and jewelry to take home and try on. She puts on her finery for her customers that evening, and they make fun of her. She flees in humiliation and the jewels she put on so happily moments before now feel like they are scalding her. Her customers sing a lively qawwali to try and coax her out. But when she emerges, this time in her dance costume, they laugh at her again and she realizes that she means nothing to them, they don’t think of her as a person with feelings or emotions. The next day, subdued, she brings back the jewelry and bridal sari to Ma, who is recovering nicely. Ma’s warm greeting and kind affection makes her feel even worse. Meanwhile, Mohan has fallen for Rajani, and he wants to speak to her father. Jeevan puts him off, and he returns home to find Rajani there. He expresses his affection gently, and she tells him that she is not worthy. She leaves sadly, and the next evening refuses to dance for her customers. Lallu’s threats don’t move her either, and she throws him out after an impassioned speech about how he has been living off her earnings for years. He goes, but vows that he will make her dance in the bazaar. She goes to see Jeevan and makes him promise that he won’t tell Mohan the truth about her, not because she thinks she has a future with him, but because she can’t bear to become a lesser woman in his eyes. Soon after that, Mohan sees Rajani walking in the street. When he calls her name she flees, and he follows her to her house. Mohan is horrified and angry. He tells his bewildered mother that he will never see Rajani again.

He picks it up and a weird woman in black with pale skin and long black hair tells him he's going to die. His classmate Noriko and her older sister bump into him where he tells them he is going to die. Takeshi puts the ticket in the lost and found, and rides on an empty train and heads towards home. When the train passes by a tunnel, the train is stopped by the conductor who sees a dead body and exits to examine the spot. Meanwhile the woman Takeshi saw before is beside him, who blankly mutters ""Give... it... back..."" Takeshi walks away from her. As he does, the train door suddenly opens up, and he is pulled by the woman outside of the train, screaming for help. The train starts to move. The next day Takeshi is reported missing. Noriko shows her sister, Nana, the ticket and says she found the ticket Takeshi was holding. Nana touches the ticket and sees the death of a baby and her mother. A conductor  is demoted to lost and found organizer because of him stopping the train. The police mention there were 4 reports this month about a body on the railway. His friend asked him if he saw ""The ghost"". The next day, on Noriko's day back from school, she sees Takeshi walking on the other side of the train tracks. She follows him and is never seen again. Nana, now knowing something is up with the tunnel, decides to investigate on it. She remembers the name on the ticket as Aonuma Yaeko. She goes and visits the demoted conductor to check the lost and found history. It turns out that ticket has been returned many times and all those who returned it ended up missing. Nana examines the picture of those who went missing. One side of their faces is decomposing with black marks and their eyes have become black. She walks away. Kanae, Nana's classmate, is on a train. Her boyfriend finds a bracelet between a seat cushion and passes it to her, saying she should wear it, it's brand new. Kanae wears it but later on her ""friends"" call her a fool for wearing it because it was randomly found. Kanae tries to phone her boyfriend but he does not pick up. She heads to the station, while trying to remove the bracelet, which proves impossible, she sees her boyfriend. She walks up to him in the deserted train station where he reaches out and strangles her. It turns out the spirit which Takeshi saw  is controlling her boyfriend. Kanae pushes her boyfriend onto the tracks and Yaeko leaves the host. Her boyfriend, having very few seconds to spare, tells her to beware of Yaeko and dies, hit by a train. Nana receives a message from Noriko which tells her she found Takeshi and is going to follow him. Nana arrives to Takeshi's home to find it in a mess. She investigates the mess until something drops from the ceiling. It is Takeshi, pale black, controlled by Yaeko, and naked. He tries to attack her, but she dodges and runs into a room. Takeshi's mother is seen crying repeating ""It's not Takeshi"". Nana is at the police station explaining what happened. She leaves without anyone believing her. Outside the window she sees Kanae with her parents with the police. It appears she is thought to be the murderer of her boyfriend. The next day, Kanae is walking down the subway until she sees a shadow. Yaeko grabs Kanae by the arm towards the railway tracks until Nana arrives. Yaeko dissipates. They both talk and become friends who agree to tackle the mystery to find Noriko and avenge Kanae's boyfriend. On the way there, Nana gets a phone call from the hospital where it is revealed her mother had a seizure. She goes to visit her mother while Kanae braves the subway on her own. In there, she sees a black shadow right away. She hides behind a pillar. Nana phones her to ask her how she's doing. Just then, Yaeko appears out of the tunnel and drags Kanae's hand with the bracelet onto the railway tracks with a train coming. Just then a hand appears... Nana, distraught over Kanae's death, visits the lost and found employee. She blames him for not telling her that he knows what is going on. Just then she finds a scrapbook  and he shares what he learned. Yaeko was a person who died in the tunnel presumed by a train. She also gave birth before she died but the baby is either dead or alive. Her bracelet and ticket are missing after the crime scene so they figure out Yaeko is after her belongings and her baby who the man thinks is dead. Meanwhile, Kanae wakes up to find herself in a house. There is a person there who reveals she lost her son, Yuuki, to Yaeko too. She reveals that her son was possessed when he came home. When she opened the door, her son  jumped on her and pushed one of his thumbs into her eye, and one into the right side of her forehead. She reveals those places he touched were disfigured like they were badly burned. Kanae phones Nana to tell her she's okay. Nana says that she was her only friend, and that she will save Noriko even if she dies. Kanae plans on going to the subway to stop her, saying she has no idea what she's dealing with after she heard Yuuki's mother's story. Nana hangs up and goes with the lost and found employee to the subway. Kanae and Yuuki's mother head to the subway to stop them. Kanae and Yuuki's mother are in a car and are riding in an open field. When they come across train rails which lead from the tunnel, a train comes so they must stop. Suddenly a bunch of hands appear on the backseat window. Yuuki's mother is pulled out of the car and Kanae is trapped in the car. The hands force the car to drive in front of the train, and Kanae says, ""Please Save Nana!"" just as the train crashes into the car. Yuuki's mother meets Nana and the lost and found person at the subway. She introduces herself and says that she will go with them. The lost and found person drives a loose train into the tunnel for a quick getaway. They make him wait there. The mother and Nana find Yaeko crawling toward them. She grabs their faces and they experience the past. It turns out Yaeko was a victim too. She found the bracelet over the tunnel. When she wore it, a spirit pulled her into a tunnel just when the train came. She gave birth after her injury. The spirits dragged her to her death as her child stayed there crying. Nana sees that there are three scar marks on the baby's chest. Due to Yaeko's sadness and hatred, she was a stronger spirit than the ones who died there. Afterwards, Yuuki's mother is distraught over her dead son, which she can't avenge. Nana backs away from Yaeko's spirit and bumps into the wall, which collapses. The wall reveals a cave. She enters the cave to find the cause of this evil, a statue of some ancient burial ground. She finds Noriko sleeping on a mountain of dead bodies. She wakes her up and is about to escape until Yaeko  attacks them. Yuuki's mother drags the spirit down onto a stalagmite. Yaeko's spirit dies, Nana sees the same scars on Yuuki's mother's chest exactly the same as Yaeko's baby and that Yuuki's mother is in fact Yaeko's child. Yuuki's mother dies whispering that at long last she can be with her child. Nana and Noriko run out and back into the tunnel, suddenly they can hear screams and the dead bodies starts to revive back as zombies chasing after them. The sisters escape into the cave. Just then the floor below Nana's feet collapses, which leads into a bottomless pit. Holding onto the edge, Noriko tries to pull her older sister up but the zombie mob is getting closer. A spirit is behind Noriko and tries to grab her but Nana grabs the spirit and lets go of the platform. She falls but the lost and found guy grabs her hand and pulls her up. When he was grabbing her, she saw Kanae's spirit pulling her up also. They escape on the train, running over a couple of zombies on the way. Nana comments that this will not stop, and the man states he can't leave it like this. The next day, Noriko and Nana visit their mother.

Guy Hunter, Jr., Steven Shaefer, Steve Tate, Beverly Clark, Phoebe Jeter, Jonathan Alston, Ben Pennington, Mary Rhoads, Devon Jones and Lawrence Slade are introduced to the viewer, mostly in the context of family and friends back home, while Iraq invades Kuwait, Kuwaitis resist the invasion, Saddam Hussein takes foreign nationals in Iraq prisoner as human shields, the United States progressively increases its forces in and around Saudi Arabia, Army Reserve units become activated for Desert Shield, the United Nations sets a deadline for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait, and finally, Saddam Hussein ignores that deadline up to the first commercial break. The activations mean that Ben Pennington does not get to tell his father and brother, who are off in the woods, goodbye, Phoebe Jeter does not get to see her ill grandmother for one last time, Daniel Maldonado misses the birth of his daughter, and one bride, Linda Buckholz, has to show her wedding to the guests on video. The viewer is treated to displays of American and coalition military deployment as contemporary radio news reports inform the viewer that the United Nations coalition has started to attack Iraq and occupied Kuwait as a prelude to liberating Kuwait. As Ben Pennington is deployed aboard an Air Force rescue helicopter, a hidden cameraman interviews him, and Ben replies that they are deliberately attracting Iraqi radar so AH-64 Apache helicopters can target the radars with anti-radiation missiles to clear a corridor for the bombers and simultaneously providing rescue cover in case a pilot is shot down and needs to be rescued by Ben and the crew on board. The viewer gets to hear more news reports about infrared and night vision technology and laser-guided missiles fired from planes including the F-117 Nighthawk while a Nighthawk is displayed and gun camera footage shows various targets being destroyed in a sterile, precise fashion.

She is befriended by Walter, a has-been magician with a gambling habit who entertains casino guests for tips. Clyde Snow, meanwhile, is deeply in debt to gamblers, to the extent that he must ask his younger brother Godfrey, a college basketball star, to shave points at games. The violent and verbally abusive Victor is a criminal who may or may not be the front for Ivan, a mob boss no one actually has seen. A crippled detective named Brunner is investigating a murder that Victor's thugs no doubt committed, possibly on Ivan's orders. Victor also must deal with Augie, who wants to cut in on his bookmaking business. Augie is secretly wearing a wire for the detective, looking to get an incrimidating statement from Victor on tape. Carolyn's husband is upset with her constant absences and ultimately catches her gambling. He wants a divorce. Walter gets a tip from Victor that a basketball game is fixed. He decides to wager everything he owns on the outcome, and persuades Carolyn to do the same. Unbeknownst to them, Clyde has told his brother that his debt is paid off, meaning there is no need to lose the game on purpose. It is not true.

Nicky has a learning disability from his youth and Gino takes care of him and helps him get through life. Gino is studying to become a doctor at a local hospital and cannot finish his education in Pittsburgh; he is afraid that Nicky cannot take care of himself and that he depends on Eugene to look after him. Nicky has a job working for a garbage collection company, a job that supports his brother's education. He and a man named Larry  work for Mr. Johnson . Larry is Nicky's best friend, albeit a bit of a wiseacre who constantly puts wild ideas into Nicky's mind. Eugene begins helping a nurse named Jennifer , who is working at the same hospital where he is, to study for her exams. He begins to develop feelings for her as the movie progresses. Nicky mentions this to Larry while they are working and Larry does not miss the opportunity to plant the idea in Nicky's head that Jennifer and Eugene are sleeping together. On the night of his and Nicky's birthday, Eugene must work late at the hospital and calls a very disappointed Nicky to tell him. Nicky instead starts to take Larry to a Wrestlemania event he and Eugene were going to see. Larry instead takes Nicky with him to a woman called Mrs. Vincent whom Larry is occasionally intimate with. Nicky does not engage in sexual intercourse with Mrs. Vincent and instead goes outside as Larry has fun with her inside. Nicky is surprised to find a young boy named Mikey Chernak, who is Mrs. Vincent's next door neighbour and also someone he knows from his garbage route, outside with bruises on his face. When Nicky asks where the bruises are from Mikey replies he fell. Nicky does not understand that it is Mikey's father Martin  who abuses him and assumes Mikey is telling the truth. Larry and Nicky go bar-hopping and both get very drunk, all the while Larry constantly and drunkenly taunts Nicky about Eugene's relationship with Jennifer. Nicky stumbles home and finds Jennifer and Eugene sitting and talking. Nicky believes they are sleeping together and tells Eugene that he knows he is 'screwing' Jennifer. Eugene gets very angry and roughly shoves Nicky before sending him to bed. An insulted Jennifer leaves. Later, Nicky, Eugene, Jennifer and Mrs. Gianelli, who lives next door, go on a picnic and bring Nicky's dog Fred. Fred is hit by a car, greatly disturbing Nicky. Several days later, Nicky is collecting garbage at Mikey's house and through the window views Martin hitting Mikey and forcing him down the stairs. The father shoves him too hard and sends the boy to the bottom of the stairs. The father races to the phone and calls 911, telling them the boy fell. The father sees a shocked Nicky through the window as Larry and Mr. Johnson find Nicky by the window. Nicky is horrified, speechless and unable to act, to move, to tell Larry what is wrong, what he's witnessed. The father lies and says Mikey fell; both are concerned and soon neighbors, including Mrs Vincent and Theresa, Mikey's mother, arrive at the scene. An ambulance appears and takes Mikey to the hospital. An inconsolable Nicky runs after the ambulance, leaving his co-workers at the garbage truck shouting after him to ask what's wrong. Nicky runs to the hospital where Martin drags him into a closet and tells him that Mikey is dead, warning Nicky that if he tells anybody what he did, he will kill Nicky also. A horrified Nicky flees. Later on, Nicky takes a gun from Mr. Johnson's truck  and goes back to the home of Martin and his wife Theresa where they and a gathering of neighbors and friends grieve. Nicky steals a baby, Mikey's younger brother Joey, from his parents at gunpoint and runs away believing he is protecting the baby from the father. He is eventually cornered in a building where a SWAT Team surrounds the place. Eugene and Jennifer as well as Martin and Theresa race to the building. Eugene is sent in to get Nicky and the baby out. He goes in and is confronted by Nicky who now believes after seeing the domestic abuse of Mikey that their father did the same to him and that is why he is mentally challenged. Eugene breaks down and admits that it is true. Yet, he also reveals that despite this it was always Nicky standing up to their father and always protecting Eugene. He tells of how one night their father got really mad at Eugene and that Nicky took the beating instead of Eugene and that is why Nicky is mentally challenged. A sobbing Eugene tells Nicky he does not want to become like their father and he is at times afraid of himself and how he gets mad at Nicky. Nicky comforts him and tells him that he is not and that he loves him. They exit the building and hand the baby, Joey, over to Theresa. Eugene protests as the Pittsburgh Police handcuff Nicky. Martin races forward with a gun and aims for Nicky. Eugene and two police officers manage to subdue him. Nicky tells everyone how Martin abused Mikey and how he killed him. A horrified Theresa realizes that that is true. Nicky is released and the father is hauled away in handcuffs. At the end, Eugene kisses Jennifer as she leaves for medical school and she says she will leave a number with Nicky. The twins embrace one last time and then Eugene also leaves. The credits roll as Nicky goes on his daily garbage route, happily embracing the future with content and a new understanding of himself."

Mammy Two Shoes answers the door while Tom and Jerry hide in a drawer. Mammy has adopted ""three little fluffy kittens"". Mammy calls Tom into the living room, but as the maid turns her back, the trio reveal their true colors and prepare to attack her using a lit match placed in her slipper, a firework placed in the bow of her apron and a slingshot aimed directly at her ample backside. Before they can pull it off, they hide the paraphernalia because Mammy turns around and Tom is in the living room. Mammy tells Tom that he is to take care of them while she runs an errand, but when Tom turns his back, the kittens take the slingshot, match and firework, attack Tom, and make it look like they were the ones attacked by planting a knife on Tom and appearing knocked out. Mammy, having been fooled by the three kittens, slaps Tom with a broom. She issues an ultimatum that if Tom isn't a good care-provider in her absence, she will ""pulverize"" him to pieces. Mammy then leaves. Tom makes sure she's gone before attempting to harm the kittens, but they play good for a period of time until Muff  and Fluff  put Tom on roller skates and slam him into the upper half of a 2-section door, which Puff . closes and smacks Tom flat. Jerry pokes his head out of the drawer as the cats hide in a green suit. They point in a far direction before Tom sees he's been fooled. Tom pulls all the cats out and they continue to let themselves be pulled out in sequence until Muff substitutes Tom's tail for himself. Tom flips over and hits his head. Jerry watches and laughs, but hides when Tom comes along and shows himself to the three kittens. He directs them to Tom, but the three kittens surround him and make evil faces. Jerry laughs at what they did to Tom before he realizes they want to catch him and gulps. He dives into the drawer and is followed by all three kittens. Jerry leads the way while Muff holds him by the tail. He lets go of Jerry and flattens him over a grate in the floor, making Jerry look like a waffle. While Tom watches the chase, Puff blocks Jerry's entry to his hole with a glass pane and then lets him through such that he is caught in a grinder by Fluff, which shapes him into a hot dog. Muff stuffs him into a sandwich, and Puff slaps mustard on it and bites into it, but Jerry escapes out a window. Tom laughs at the cats' failure, but Fluff aims an umbrella into Tom's mouth. The three cats are chased by Tom, but they stop him and slam him against the ceiling. Puff and Muff revive him and offer a handshake. Tom gladly obliges, but his third handshake is from Muff: it's not his hand, but a window curtain. Tom is thrown outside of the house. Then, Tom and Jerry team up to get revenge against the kittens for good.  Tom has the serving cart in closet, loaded with three pies and a watermelon. Next Jerry lures the kittens by drinking up their milk from their bowl and then spitting it in the kittens' faces. The kittens get annoyed and start to chase Jerry. Then, Tom cut the string and his cart slides down. Tom and Jerry and chase The kittens all through the house. The chased team hide themselves behind the sofa, then Jerry whistles and the three get pied. Then Tom flies out of the window and turns around to enter through the other side. The kittens chase Jerry, but Tom returns in time and throws the watermelon at them, causing Fluff to swallow it. Tom scoops up the kittens in the cart's bottom and he drops them down near a clothesline, and Jerry prepares a carpet beater, spanks each of them on the fanny and twirls the clothesline. Then Tom got off the cart with some paper sheets, scissors and string to make angel wings and puts them on the kittens as a final humiliation. Then Mammy returns with a bottle of cream. She looks for the kittens, but hears some smacks and sees red fannies on all three kittens and angel wings on their backs as if to say, ""Here are your little angels""."

Makham falls in a pack of five stray dogs who live in a burned out neighborhood. An illustrated sequence during the opening credits shows the lives of the strays and how their village came to be burned down. The five strays are led by an old mixed breed hound named Luang Kaffee. The other dogs are mostly mixed breed as well, except for a poodle named Sexy. The dogs are starving. They cannot forage for food in the nearby temple because of a rival pack of strays. A neighboring orchard is off limits because of some fierce guard dogs. And there is a gated, high-class housing estate, but the dogs are stopped from entering by a kindly young security guard. Makham manages to sneak his way into the estate anyway, and his eyes are captured by a female collie, Nam Kang. A rich neighbor is after Nam Kang's female owner, and brings in his own collie, Tommy, as a potential companion for Nam Kang to woo Nam Kang's owner. The man is angry with Makham because Makham had earlier disrupted a lavish birthday party. The man reveals himself as a cruel person, wanting to poison the strays or shoot them with a pistol. Hope for the strays comes from Makham, who knows of a ""Dogtopia"", where all dogs are well fed and cared for. It is across a busy highway that no dog has survived the crossing. The older dog, Luang Kaffee, is injured in an initial attempt at crossing. So the strays pool their resources to try and cross the road. They find a wagon to pull Luang Kaffee in, and determine that on the full moon, there is a temple fair when traffic will be stopped and they can cross. Eventually they do cross and find Dogtopia, where indeed they are cared for. Makham is reunited with his owner, who is at the fair. And all the dogs live happily ever after."

They called her 'Esther' in post-war Yugoslavia a generation ago, but they haven't seen her since her father forbade contact at that time, shortly after they helped her escape Yugoslavia to re-unite with him. Now that she is gone the way is clear for them to be together again and perhaps to see her child, whom they've never met. Flashbacks return us to those days where they forged enduring friendships against the backdrop of the struggle between Communist and American ideals in Tito's Yugoslavia. The ""four"" are fascinated by American music and styles, while their rival rowing team is led by a competitor for Esther's affections, a rising member in the Communist elite who bears tattoos of Stalin and Lenin on his wrists. Each of the four harbored a secret passion for Esther's inspiring beauty. The first modestly allows that he can't tell her what he feels. The next tempts her heart with poetry. Glenn then confesses his love in drunken confidence that he shrugs off as a joke. The last swaggers that it's obvious they are a couple and the rest will understand eventually. But Esther reminds each of them in turn that the five of them are ""a four."" Despite the shock when she finds herself with child by an outsider, they spirit her across the water to her father's protective embrace.

They enter the church's office and encounter the terrified and smarmy deacon, they realize the church is far from empty as they believed, they accompany the deacon to a meeting planning to leave quickly so that his absence does not cause suspicion. During the meeting it is made clear that the Deacon is pushing the pastor to move the church. Tianna sees the deacon for the money-hungry self-righteous man he is, but is unable to convince her father. She is however close to one of the Church senior members, Momma T. The church choir then show up for an unscheduled rehearsal further endangering the pairs' plans. Finally losing patience Durrel fires a gun into the air and orders the Deacon to get the money. When they try to steal the money they find that the money has already been stolen. Enraged they both hold the church hostage until the money turns up. Durrel ties the pastor up as he is defiant and difficult and interrogates everyone about the money's whereabouts. He appears to suspect Tianna who looks down on him for obvious reasons. She reminds him that the pastor is her father, Durrel rebukes her by reminding her without money the church could not move, to which she has no argument. Meanwhile Lee John takes a little boy Timmy to the bathroom as he was making a fuss about wanting to go when he says he'll take the child back to his mother  the boy reveals his real mother left him and Lee John feels empathy with the boy. The police pass by and Durrell orders everyone to the back room and orders Ricky to poke his head out the door and talk to them. Ricky does so and attempts to signal to them with blinks and long drawn out words, however he is just seen as eccentric. The hostages moan that it is too hot. Durell goes to fix the broken air conditioner while LeeJohn watches over the hostages. To Lee John's bewilderment sister Doris begins cooking for everyone, using the church's kitchen, she gives him a plate and fondly remembers how her husband loved her cooking on his birthday. He expresses his sadness at never having had a birthday as no one knew his birthday, and is comforted by Sister Doris. Meanwhile, Durell and Tianna go to fix the air conditioner. After an awkward conversation where Tianna warms to Durrel and questions what he is doing, they finally get the air-conditioning going, and Durell orders everyone back to the lobby. Then the blind, deaf janitor finds the missing money. Durell receives a phone call from his son, which he is ashamed to answer. Momma T then asks for Durell's purpose for what he is doing. Durell answers that he is doing it for his son. Momma T then says that Durell is doing it for himself, as he is blaming everyone but the person responsible, himself;  Durell says that he will not lose his son and leaves the money. Unfortunately, cops have surrounded the church blocking their way out. The pastor tells them to escape out the back, which leads to a chase in which gets the two of them caught. At the trial, which the entire church attends, the Deacon says that they have been accused of stealing 64,000 dollars. The amount of money collected was half of what the Deacon claimed was stolen, which puts the deacon at question. The case is dropped after no one stands when witnesses are called. Durell goes back to Omunique's apartment where he is confronted by the men who gave them the wheelchairs. After he explains his situation, the two men allow him to go and get his son. Omunique opens the door yelling at Durell asking him where did the money come from. The money was left at her doorstep and Durell tells her it was a gift and implores her not take his son away, saying that his son is all he has. She tells him that she will stay. In the end LeeJohn and Durrel appear much happier and it is implied that Durrel is closer to his ex-wife and son while LeeJohn remains close to Doris and Timothy. The remaining money is used to restore the community and Tianna is seen painting a community centre.

11077335	/m/02q_7_2	Doctor Zhivago	2002			{}	{}	"{""/m/04xvh5"": ""Costume drama""}"	The story begins in Tsarist Russia in the early 1900s and is set primarily against the backdrop of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the subsequent Russian Civil War of 1918–1921. At its core is Larissa Guishar Antipova, a young woman from Moscow who has a profound effect on three men who become enamored with her. Victor Komarovsky, an unctuous, wealthy businessman with political connections, is involved in a casual affair with Lara's bourgeois dressmaker mother Amalia, who encourages her teenaged daughter to accept his invitation to dinner in an attempt to retain his financial support of her household. Initially Lara is repelled by the thought, but she finally accepts and eventually uses her sexual power to seduce and ultimately control him. Idealistic student Pasha Antipov marries Lara, and the two have a child. It is assumed he is killed in World War I, but he embraces Bolshevism and later emerges as Strelnikov, an infamous Red Army general who seemingly has no concern for his family. The title character is poet and doctor Yuri Zhivago, who first sees Lara from the window of a café. The two meet when he and his mentor are called to minister to Amalia after she attempts suicide in response to her daughter's relationship with Victor Komarovsky, and encounter each other again when Lara tries to shoot Komarovsky at a Christmas party. Zhivago eventually marries his cousin, Tonya Gromeko, with whom he was raised after his father, who was involved in shady business dealings with Komarovsky, killed himself. He and Lara are reunited in a makeshift field hospital, where she is serving as a nurse while searching for her missing husband. The two fall in love but do not consummate their relationship until after the war, when Zhivago and his family move to his uncle's family estate near Yuryatin, a remote village in the Ural Mountains where Lara is living with her daughter. Zhivago is captured by red partisan fighters who need him to be their medic. Lara is called to serve as the midwife when Tonya is ready to deliver her second child, and Tonya realizes who she is. When it becomes clear they are fighting a lost cause, Zhivago abandons the red partisans and treks across the mountains to Lara's house, where she nurses him back to health. Meanwhile, Tonya, her children, and her father have returned to Moscow. Pursued by Komarovsky, now a leader in the Communist party, Zhivago, Lara and her daughter flee to Varykino. Months later Komarovsky, still obsessed with Lara, arrives and offers them safe passage out of Russia. They initially refuse, but Komarovsky persuades Zhivago it is in Lara's best interests to leave because of her connection to Strelnikov, who has fallen from grace and lost his position in the Red Army. Zhivago convinces Lara, who is expecting their child, to leave with Komarovsky, telling her he will follow her shortly. Strelnikov, now a hunted man, arrives at Varykino in search of his family soon after they leave with Komarovsky. Zhivago assures him Lara and his daughter are safe, and Strelnikov kills himself. Zhivago returns to Moscow and learns his wife, son, and father-in-law were removed from their home and their location is unknown. Several years later, while sitting in a café, he sees a young boy who reminds him of himself as a child passing on the street with his mother, who he realizes is Lara. Before he can reach the pair, he suffers a fatal heart attack. Lara brings young Yuri to view his father's body, and as the two near their home, she realizes that Joseph Stalin's NKVD is waiting to place her under arrest. Pretending they're playing a game, she urges her son to run away as quickly as he can before she surrenders to the authorities.

In the United States , the verdict in criminal cases  must normally be unanimous. A non-unanimous verdict results in a hung jury which in turn forces a mistrial. The question they are deciding is whether the defendant, a teenage boy from a city slum, murdered his father. The jury is further instructed that a guilty verdict will be accompanied by a mandatory death sentence . The jury of twelve retires to the jury room where they begin to become acquainted with each other's personalities and discuss the case. The plot of the film revolves around their difficulty in reaching a unanimous verdict, mainly due to several of the jurors' personal prejudices. An initial vote is taken and eleven of the jurors vote for conviction. Juror number 8, the lone dissenter, states that the evidence presented is circumstantial and the boy deserves a fair deliberation, upon which he questions the accuracy and reliability of the only two witnesses to the murder, the fact that the knife used in the murder is not as unusual as testimony promotes , and the overall shady circumstances. Having argued several points, Juror 8 requests another vote, this time by secret ballot. He proposed that he would abstain from voting, and if the other eleven jurors voted guilty unanimously, then he would acquiesce to their decision. However, if at least one juror voted ""not guilty"" then they would continue deliberating. In a secret ballot Juror 9 is the first to support Juror 8, and not necessarily believing the accused is not guilty, but feeling that Juror 8's points deserve further discussion. After hearing further deliberations concerning whether one witness actually heard the murder take place, Juror 5  changes his vote to ""not guilty."" This earns criticism from Juror 3, who accuses him of switching only because he had sympathy for slum children. Soon afterward, Juror 11, questioning whether the defendant would have reasonably fled the scene and come back three hours later to retrieve his knife, also changes his vote. After Jurors 2 and 6 also decide to vote ""not guilty"" to tie the vote at 6-6, Juror 7  becomes tired and also changes his vote just so that the deliberation may end, which earns him nothing but shame. When pressed by Juror 11, however, Juror 7 says he believes the defendant is not guilty. The next people to change their votes are Jurors 12 and 1 when Juror 8 demonstrates that it is unlikely that one witness actually saw the boy flee the scene, making the vote 9-3. The only dissenters left are Jurors 3, 4, and 10. The remaining jurors are intrigued when Juror 11 proves that although the psychiatric test presented in the case stated that the boy had subconscious desires to kill, tests of such do not prove anything other than what could possibly happen. Outraged at how the proceedings have gone, Juror 10 proceeds to go onto a bigoted and narrow-minded rage on why people from the slums can’t be trusted, and as he speaks, Juror 4 responds, ""Sit down. And don't open your filthy mouth again."" When Juror 4 is pressed as to why he still maintained his vote, he states his belief that despite all the other evidence that has been called into question, the fact remains that the woman who saw the murder from across the street still stands as solid evidence. After he points this out, Juror 12 changes his vote back to ""guilty"" to make the vote 8-4 again. Then Juror 9, after seeing Juror 4 rub his nose , realizes that, like Juror 4, the witness who alleged to see the murder had impressions in the sides of her nose, indicating that she wore glasses, and likely was not wearing them when she saw the murder.

He goes off on a tirade, presenting the evidence in haphazard fashion, before coming to what has really been bothering him all along: the idea that a son would kill his own father . He begins to weep and says he can feel the knife being plunged into his chest. Juror 8 points out quietly that the boy is not his son, and Juror 4 pats his arm and says, ""Let him live"", and the man gives in. The final vote is unanimous for acquittal.

An investigation by the FSB ensues when a car bomb explodes outside one of Komarov’s pharmaceutical companies, and a virus is stolen from inside. Heading the investigation FSB agents Sonia Astrova  and her colleague Andrei Kasanov . They come up against difficulty by the director of the FSB, Anatoly Grishin . A British Embassy worker from Moscow, Sir Nigel Irvine ([[Michael York , travels to southern Spain to try and find Jason Monk , a former CIA operative who ran double agents in the Soviet Union, and tries to convince him to go to Moscow and investigate the Komarov Industries bombing. Eventually, after much persuasion, including help to find his Russian daughter, Monk agrees to go. Once in Moscow, Jason finds an old friend, Victor Akopov , whose brother Sergei was a double agent of Jason’s, who was personally executed by Komarov. Victor agrees to hide Jason from Komarov’s men. Pretending to be a friend of Sonia Astrova’s father, he gains access to her office and steals a sample of residue from the bombing, which he gives to another friend of his, Vladimir Tonkin , a former scientist. Tonkin finds that the explosive used was Semtex H, with a direct traceable link to the FSB. When he tells Jason about his findings, he is killed by Vladimir Dorganosov , the same man who attacked Komarov industries and stole the bioweapon, who has since released it into a Muslim village in Dagestan. Outgoing Russian president Cherkassov  wants the biological situation in Dagestan to be dealt with internally, but later on, after much persuasion from Komarov and Grishin, he sends out an international alert to identity and contain the outbreak. Sonia locates Leonid Zaitzev , a cleaner who worked at the Komarov Industries plant and saw Dorganosov steal the virus, who has gone on the run after his home was ransacked. While questioning him, Grishin arrests Zaitzev and fires Sonia and Andrei. Zaitzev was later by killed by Dorganosov while in custody. Sonia goes home to find Jason waiting for her, and agrees to help him access the FSB network. However, they are fired at by Dorganosov, and a car chase ensues, with Dorganosov tracking them by using Sonia’s phone, until she discards it. They go to Andrei’s house, where they find him already dead. After the chase, Dorganosov demands the rest of his payment from his contractor, who is none other than Anatoly Grishin. While they are arguing, Komarov himself arrives and orders Grishin to kill Dorganosov. While at Victor’s apartment, Jason and Sonia come to realise that Grishin knew about the bombing in advance, and raid his house for information. Jason is injured, and while he is unconscious, Sonia locates his daughter Elena  and brings her to him. While trawling through the information gained from Grishin’s computer, they come across a photograph which reveals that Grishin and Komarov are old friends, and a secret manifesto written by Komarov, which tells of his plans to unleash genocide on any “undesirables” from Russia. Jason realises that the bombing and the theft of the bioweapon were planned by Komarov from the beginning. The virus was released to look like a terrorist attack, allowing Komarov to be elected President, he being the only candidate with an anti-terror campaign. It was also the beginning of the genocide. Jason and Sonia go Komarov’s Presidential opponent, General Nikolayev, who stages a press conference and tells of Komarov’s involvement in the bombing at his facility. However, Grishin arrives and introduces Komarov, who tells of his coincidental ownership of vaccines to every virus in his facility. The move boosts Komarov’s popularity, and leads to his election. Jason and Sonia confront Komarov’s American electoral hacker, Harvey Blackledge , who tells them of a facility outside Moscow. Afterwards, Blackledge was killed by an assassin posing as a taxi driver. Jason and Sonia travel there, and find that Komarov’s famous speech of “sun rays spreading across Russia” means his plan for genocide, with different viruses each targeting different ethnic minorities within the country. After battling to escape the facility, Jason and Sonia find Victor dead in his apartment. Jason then travels to Elena’s house where he is captured by Komarov’s men. After being interrogated by Grishin, he escapes with the help of Elena, and Sonia, who kills Grishin and takes his phone, which allows them to locate the FSB agents spreading the viruses. After Jason secretly hands Grishin's phone to Sir Nigel, he orders the arrests of the rogue FSB agents. Komarov’s plan is revealed publicly, and riots ensue in the streets, calling for his resignation. Komarov, hidden from the public, instigates martial law. When he is spotted, he orders his men to fire into the crowd of people trying to get to him. Before they can fire, however, Nikolayev arrives and commands them to lower their weapons. The crowd storm the building, however Komarov escapes down an alleyway, where he is confronted by Jason Monk and Sonia. As he tries to kill Jason, however, he is shot, and the crowd rushes in and kills him. Nikolayev becomes the acting President, and Sonia is appointed head of the FSB. Jason moves back to Spain with Elena, and resumes his job hiring out a fishing boat.

The first set of three challenges are for Tarzan to prove he is worthy to be accepted into Kashi's service. First is an archery contest to test his skill. Then Tarzan stands between two tall posts, grasps handles which are attached to two ropes which run over the top of each post and are attached to buffalo. When the buffalo are driven apart, Tarzan is lifted into the air and stretched to test his strength. He passes the test by not letting go of either handle. Third, he is asked to answer a question designed to test his wisdom. The second set of three challenges are for the young new leader, Kashi. First he must choose the correct diamond out of three. Second he must choose an empty goblet out of three. Last, he must choose one urn of ashes of the deceased previous leader out of five. After passing all three tests, Khan then comes forward and demands that Kashi take the fourth test of three challenges of life or death combat events called ""The Challenge Of Might"" which haven't been invoked in a thousand years. The boy chooses Tarzan as his defender, which Tarzan accepts. Tarzan and Khan battle each other in two of the challenge events of the fourth test which concludes with the third and final challenge event with each man fighting with swords on a wide mesh net suspended above large vats of boiling oil in which Khan dies by falling through the net into one of the boiling vats."

He sends his other son, Dan , to gather his ranch hands while he attends to the burial. Merrick offers to help, but is met with implacable hostility. After Roden leaves, Merrick finds a pocket watch. Keith suggests that they spend the night at his home, as it is nearby. Merrick accepts, but has cause to regret his decision when Keith's daughter Ann  ambushes them. Fortunately, Merrick is able to disarm her with no harm done. When they leave, Ann decides to go with them. After he is warned of Roden's intentions by fellow ranchers, Merrick decides to take an unexpected desert route, where he can see if he is being trailed. The ploy fails, however, and the party is overtaken by Roden and his men. In the ensuing gunfight, Merrick's best friend and deputy, Billy Shear , is wounded. Merrick forces Roden to go away by capturing his son Dan. As they travel on, Billy dies. Merrick and Ann start falling in love. The marshal reveals that his unswerving devotion to duty is because the one time he neglected it, it cost his father his life. He was a deputy to his marshal father, and refused to help escort two prisoners. All three were lynched. Ann sympathizes, but warns him that her first loyalty is to her father. Meanwhile, Dan convinces the remaining deputy, Lou Gray , to help him escape by the bribe of a ranch. When the group reaches a waterhole, only to find the water undrinkable, a disagreement breaks out. All but Merrick want to head to a river half a day to the south.

Now, he has three prisoners. After two days without sleep, an exhausted Merrick drops from his horse. Keith grabs his gun, but is unwilling to shoot. When Gray goes for his rifle, Keith kills him, then hands the gun back to Merrick. Keith is tried in Santa Loma. Merrick tells the jury that he is sure Keith is not a killer, but all the evidence and witnesses are against him, and a guilty verdict is reached. However, just before Keith is to be hanged, Merrick notices that the watch he found has an inscription to Dan. Confronted with the proof that he killed his own brother, Dan draws his revolver and grabs Ann as a shield. When his father approaches him, Dan kills him and tries to flee on horseback, but is shot in the back, just like his brother, by Merrick."

Soon, CJ gets into a fight in the bar and Scott is forced to come inside and bail him and Robbie out. Leaving the roadhouse and their new enemies at the bar behind, the three set off for Minnesota, their home state. Within a few minutes, a large, menacing black car begins stalking them, repeatedly creeping up close and backing off again. Several minutes later, they pick up Deputy Sheriff Charlie Harman, whose '86 Chevrolet police cruiser has frozen to death at the side of the road. After picking up the friendly and talkative Charlie, the 1957 Cadillac Series 75 Limousine, begins to get more and more aggressive, and for unknown reasons challenges Scott's SAAB to a drag race in which it tries repeatedly to wreck the SAAB. Suspicion over why the car is after them and who its occupants are after begins to rise within the SAAB, and Scott decides to kick Charlie out of the car and leave him, believing he is the reason they are being chased. The Cadillac then reappears, and Charlie is apparently killed by a gunman in the Cadillac. After a long while is spent by the three attempting to escape and outwit the Cadillac, the SAAB overheats and stops, and a fight breaks out between the three young men. CJ intervenes and stops the fight, and the three push the SAAB down the road to a repair garage. CJ is soon kidnapped by the Cadillac's occupants while outside, and a chase between both cars across the nearby frozen lake ensues, in which Scott's car is finally destroyed by its overheating problems. CJ is then found tied to a tree, and the reason for the entire set of events is revealed. Charlie, who is in truth a cruel and vindictive man whose death was faked by his brother, Luther, the Cadillac's driver, has been attempting to identify the man his wife had been seeing at a roadhouse, and learned that it was Scott. As he prepares to kill Scott with a hunting knife, his wife Jeanine taunts and distracts him, allowing Scott, Robbie and CJ to break free and run. An insanely enraged Charlie, now personally driving the Cadillac, chases after them. When he corners Scott at the edge of a cliff, he waits a moment, then charges. His wife appears at the last moment in front of Scott, causing Charlie to veer away, sending the black Cadillac crashing down the cliff and into the lake. The destroyed, burning car sinks into the lake while Scott, CJ, Robbie, and Jeanine look on. The next morning, the group finally makes it across the state line into Minnesota.

The source of this is traced to an office located directly above the store, where scientific equipment is found, along with a dead body. There are also signs of radioactivity, but the cause of the difficulties itself is clearly no longer in the room, or the immediate area. Investigation and request for citizen input eventually lead to an airborne flight carrying a scientist, who has developed signs of radiation sickness related to something in a heavy briefcase he carries and clutches irrationally. Before dying, he confesses to have developed an artificial radioactive isotope, serranium, which was bombarded with alpha particles for 200 hours . Unfortunately, his so-far microscopic creation has taken on a life of its own, literally: it must absorb energy from its surroundings every 11 hours, and in the process doubles its size each time. The OSI officials realize that, with its rate of growth, it will be a matter of only days before it becomes large enough to affect the Earth's rotation on its axis and spin it out of orbit. They also discover that the isotope is impervious to any known means of destroying it or even rendering it inert. The only answer appears to be to use a Canadian experimental power generator being constructed in a cavern under the ocean, with the hopes of bombarding the element with so much energy in one surge that it neutralizes itself with its own ""gluttony"". The two governments agree on this proposal, and the isotope is transferred to the project, dubbed the Deltatron, but there is a last minute objection from the engineer in charge of the project. With no time to lose, the lead OSI agent commandeers the machine and barely escapes, risking his own life to activate it before sealing the cavern-filling, multi-story device off from the rest of the underground operation, which is filled with project workers. The isotope is successfully stopped, as evidenced by the disappearance of the trace magnetism which it has produced following every energy absorption, although the Deltatron is also destroyed in the process."

Final closing arguments are presented, and the judge then instructs the jury to decide whether the boy is guilty of murder. The judge further informs them that a guilty verdict will be accompanied by a mandatory death sentence.The twelve-man jury retires to a private room, where they spend a short while getting acquainted before they begin deliberating. It is immediately apparent that the jurors have already decided that the boy is guilty, and that they plan to return their verdict quickly, without taking time for discussion – with the sole exception of Juror Number 8.His is the only ""not guilty"" vote in a preliminary tally. He explains that there is too much at stake for him to go along with the verdict without at least talking about it first. His vote annoys the other jurors, particularly Juror 7 ,who has tickets to the Dilip Kumar's movie named Mashal. The rest of the film centers around the jury's difficulty in reaching a unanimous verdict. While several of the jurors harbor personal prejudices, Juror 8 maintains that the evidence presented in the case is circumstantial, and that the boy deserves a fair deliberation. He calls into question the accuracy and reliability of the only two witnesses to the murder, the rarity of the murder weapon , and the overall questionable circumstances . He further argues that he cannot in good conscience vote ""guilty"" when he feels there is reasonable doubt of the boy's guilt. Having argued several points and gotten no favorable response from the others, Juror 8 reluctantly agrees that all he seems to be accomplishing is hanging the jury. He takes a bold gamble: He requests another vote, this time by secret ballot. He proposes that he will abstain from voting, and if the other eleven jurors are still unanimous in a guilty vote, then he will acquiesce to their decision. The secret ballot is held, and a new ""not guilty"" vote appears. Juror 9  is the first to support Juror 8, feeling that his points deserve further discussion. After Juror 8 presents a convincing argument that one of the witnesses, who claimed to have heard the boy yell ""I'm going to kill you"" shortly before the murder took place, could not have heard the voices as clearly as he had testified, as well as stating that ""I'm going to kill you,"" is said constantly and never meant literally, Juror 5  – who had grown up in a slum – changes his vote to ""not guilty."" This earns intense criticism from Juror 3 , who accuses 5 of switching only because he's sympathetic toward slum children. Soon afterward, Juror 11  questions whether the defendant would have reasonably fled the scene and come back three hours later to retrieve the knife, then also changes his vote. Juror 8 then uses another scheme to question the witness's other claim, that upon hearing the murder, he had gone to the door of his apartment and seen the defendant running out of the building, as the witness in question had an injured leg which limits his ability to walk. Upon the end of the experiment, the jury finds that the witness wouldn't have made it to the door in enough time to actually see the defendant running out. And come to the conclusion that, judging from what he heard earlier, the witness must have merely assumed it was the defendant running. Juror 3, growing more irritated throughout the process, explodes in a rant: ""He's got to burn! He's slipping through our fingers!"" Juror 8 takes him to task, calling him a ""self-appointed public avenger"" and a sadist, saying he wants the defendant to die purely for personal reasons rather than the facts. Juror 3 shouts ""I'll kill him!"" and starts lunging at 8, but is restrained by two others. 8 calmly retorts, ""You don't really mean you'll kill me, do you?"" Thus proving the point he mentioned earlier. After Jurors 2  and 6  also decide to vote ""not guilty"", tying the vote at 6–6. The storm breaks, it begins to rain heavily, and upon trying the fan, which had previously not been working, Juror 7 finds that it is now working. Increasingly impatient, Juror 7 changes his vote just so that the deliberation may end, which earns him nothing but shame. When scathingly pressed by Juror 11 about using his vote frivolously, however, Juror 7 insists that he truly believes the defendant is not guilty because he has come to have a reasonable doubt as the other jurors pore over the facts. Juror 2 calls into question the prosecution's claim that the accused, who was nearly a foot shorter than the victim, was able to stab him in such a way as to inflict the downward stab wound found on the body. Jurors 3 and 8 conduct an experiment to see if it's possible for a shorter person to stab downward into a taller person. The experiment proves that it's possible, but Juror 5 then explains that he had grown up amidst knife fights in his neighborhood, and shows, through demonstrating the correct use of a switchblade, that no one so much shorter than his opponent would have held a switchblade in such a way as to stab downward, as it would have been too awkward. This revelation augments the certainty of several of the jurors in their belief that the defendant is not guilty. The next jurors to change their votes are Jurors 12  and 1 , making the vote 9–3. The only dissenters left are Jurors 3, 4 , and 10 . Outraged at how the proceedings have gone, Juror 10 proceeds to go into a rage on why people from the slums cannot be trusted, of how they are little better than animals who gleefully kill each other off for fun. As he speaks, one by one the other jurors turn their backs to him, starting with Juror 5, until only Juror 4 remains. Confused and disturbed by this reaction to his diatribe, Juror 10 continues in a steadily fading voice and manner, concluding with the entreaty, ""Listen to me! Listen...!"" Juror 4, the only juror still facing him, tersely responds, ""I have. Now sit down and don't open your mouth again."" When Juror 4 is pressed as to why he still maintains his vote, he states his belief that despite all the other evidence that has been called into question, the fact remains that the woman who saw the murder from her bedroom window across the street  still stands as solid evidence. After he points this out, Juror 12 changes his vote back to ""guilty"" to make the vote 8–4 again. When 4 states that he doesn't believe the boy's alibi, which was being at the movies with a few friends at the time of the murder, 8 test how well 4 can remember the events of previous days. When 4 only remembers the events of the previous five days, 8 explains that being under emotional stress can make you forget certain things, and since 4 hadn't been under emotional stress, there was no reason to think the boy could remember the movie he saw. Then Juror 9, after seeing Juror 4 rub his nose , realizes that, like Juror 4, the witness who allegedly saw the murder had impressions in the sides of her nose, indicating that she wore glasses, but out of vanity did not wear them in court; he cannily asks Juror 4 if he wears his eyeglasses to sleep, and Juror 4 admits he doesn't – no one does. Juror 8 explains that there was thus no reason to expect that the witness happened to be wearing her glasses while trying to sleep, and he points out that the attack happened so swiftly that she would not have had time to put them on. After he points this out, Jurors 12, 10, and 4 all change their vote to ""not guilty."" At this point, the only remaining juror with a guilty vote is Juror 3. A long argument with Juror 8 culminates in 3 revealing that he had had a poor relationship with his son, and his anger over this fact is the main reason he wants the defendant to be guilty. Juror 3 loses his temper and tears up a photo of himself and his son, then suddenly breaks down crying and changes his vote to ""not guilty"", making the vote unanimous. As the jurors leave the room, 8 helps the distraught 3 with his coat in a show of compassion. The story ends when the friendly Jurors 8  and 9  exchange names, and all of the jurors descend the courthouse steps to return to their individual lives."

When visiting a coastal town, one of the young performers becomes involved in a market brawl after two local bullies begin to push their weight around. The righteous young performer is saved from a vicious beating at the hands of the thugs by a mysterious fighter who uses his sublime abilities to save the day. After this heroic deed, the stranger befriends the opera troupe and is accepted as one of their number by the usually suspicious entertainers. He gradually reveals to his new friends that he is a former Shaolin student and a staunch patriot - readily opposing the Manchu rulers. Unfortunately these honourable traits are of great interest to the Manchu agents who are looking to destroy any rebellion against the corrupt system. On finding their target, the agents try to capture him but, after he escapes, kill a great portion of the opera troupe instead. A further attempt to kill their patriotic enemy sees the cost of yet more innocent lives as they try viciously to bring him out of hiding. Knowing that the time to stand up for righteousness is finally here, the ex-Shaolin student organises the remaining opera troupe members into a militia to combat the powerful foes. In a finale filled with glorious fight action, the time for revenge is realised and the battle between good and evil once again takes place.

In addition to the elaborate contraption, the blueprint also depicts stick figures of a mouse and a cat. After drawing the cheese and the mouse, tired from a hard day's work, Tom retires to his bed where he dreams of potential success, fame, and fortune. While Tom sleeps, the stick figure mouse suddenly comes to life, abseils down the drawing board, and enters Jerry's mousehole to warn him about Tom's plan. Never having seen such a thing before, Jerry is skeptical and refuses to follow the stick mouse. When he is woken up again, stick mouse makes the decision for him, dragging Jerry to the drawing board and blueprint. Just then, the stick figure cat on the blueprint also comes to life; when the two mice pass by the cat, it reveals itself to them. Promptly, Jerry hands stick-mouse an eraser, who erases the cat's teeth; it grabs a brush and draws a bigger set of teeth on itself before beginning the chase. Stick-mouse draws a mousehole in empty space on the blueprint, which Jerry safely enters; however, the stick mouse is pursued by the stick cat and is caught. Jerry walks behind the cat, draws shorter hind legs on it, and erases its bigger legs, causing stick-cat to fall down. It looks down at its feet while chasing Jerry and discovers its modification, and in return, uses its tail as a lasso to retrieve Jerry. Meanwhile, stick-mouse draws a bow and arrow and fires it at the cat, who pulls the arrow out of its rear and promptly deflates its own torso. Stick-mouse runs away and camouflages itself as one of the flowers in a flowerpot on the blueprint; the cat suspects nothing, and while turned the other way, the stick-mouse ladles the cat with a fork as one would spaghetti, then runs away as it unravels itself. Both mice jump off the drawing board, with stick-mouse acting as a parachute, while stick-cat jumps down and bounces akin to a pogo stick until it comes face-to-face with a jet of water fired by stick-mouse. The cat disintegrates into white ink, and before anything more than its head can reform, Jerry sucks the cat into an ink pen and empties it into Tom's jar of white ink. The two mice shake hands, but soon hear Tom yawning, about to wake up; quickly, they alter a key measurement on the blueprint, and both mice narrowly return to their original positions before Tom sees them. Tom gets to work building his mousetrap, not noticing anything amiss.  After his trap is completed, Tom hides in anticipation as Jerry emerges from his mousehole and grabs a piece of cheese which Tom has tied to his creation. This sets off a complicated chain of events which eventually lead the release of a safe which is to flatten the mouse. Tom emerges from his hiding place and prepares Jerry for his demise by giving him one last cigarette, but the altered measurement causes the safe to land two feet closer to the mousehole - onto Tom instead of Jerry. The safe door opens, and Tom emerges, now cube-shaped like the safe's interior. Not knowing the real cause behind the trap's malfunction, he curses  over his failure and leans on the safe."

The Reverend Pierrepoint Edwards, who discovered the mass grave, was reported to have revealed, much later, in a private conversation that the bodies he'd found had been shot in the head. The veracity of that claim has remained unresolved, the suggestion being made in the film that it was not revealed at the time to protect the feelings of the King and Queen and relatives of the deceased. There is stronger evidence though in the form of the account of one survivor, , taken prisoner during the battle. He was wounded to the head and claimed to have both heard other wounded being bayonetted and shot by Turkish soldiers; and to have been attacked in the same fashion himself but was saved by a German officer. In addition at least one British officer was seen being taken prisoner during the battle but was not heard from again. However, the suggestion in the book is that, based on evidence from the time, the Turkish soldiers struggled with the concept of taking prisoners as opposed to a deliberate extermination policy. The Germans are said to have had problems getting the Turks to understand that they needed enemy troops alive for intelligence information. The film does go beyond the book in the way it portrays a larger group of men taken prisoner being deliberately executed. This is both questionable in terms of the portrayal of the Turks and in terms of recognising the fight the troops put up{{citation needed}}. From the accounts of the time, as related in the original book, it would seem that far from being tamely slaughtered as prisoners, most of the men who died did so in heavy fighting, either being killed outright or dying from the wounds suffered. The unit had advanced beyond other units in the line and as a consequence had found themselves isolated some distance behind Turkish lines. Ultimately a group of anything up to 200 men had been surrounded at a farm house and wiped out during the fighting. In the fate of Captain Beck the film makes assumptions as well. The last sighting of Beck was by one of the survivors, who saw him slumped under a tree with his head to one side, some time before the end of the battle; they couldn't be sure that he wasn't already dead at that point."

During their brief liberty, Steve spends time with his wife Sarah , while Joe meets and marries singer Pearl O'Neill . The film cuts to the union hall where merchant seamen--including the survivors of Jervis' last ship--spend their time waiting to be assigned to a new ship. Over a round of poker, Pulaski  jokes about getting a shore job. When pressed by other seaman, Pulaski reveals his fear of dying at sea. The others shame him into signing along with them for another ship. Another sailor, ""Boats"" O'Hara , is tracked down by his wife. whom he's apparently not seen since being rescued. She angrily serves him with a summons. O'Hara, knowing he's headed back to sea, gleefully tears the summons up, saying ""them 'Liberty Ships' are well named"". Then it is back to sea on a new Liberty ship, the SS Seawitch, on a convoy carrying vital war supplies to the Soviet port of Murmansk. Convoy 211 is attacked by a wolfpack, a group of German U-boats that hunt for convoys. There are losses on both sides, but the convoy commander is forced to order his ships to disperse. One persistent U-boat chases after the Seawitch, but loses contact in the night. A pair of Heinkel He 59 seaplanes find the freighter and attack. Both are shot down, but the second crashes into the bow. Steve is shot in the leg during the battle; Joe has to take command. The U-boat sights the ship again and hits her with a torpedo. Joe orders the men to set fires and make smoke so that it appears as if the ship is sinking. When the submarine surfaces to finish her off, Joe rams and sinks it. The Seawitch then limps into Murmansk to a warm Russian welcome."

Holmes explains what Moriarty did, notices that a window shade that was shut in the empty house is now open, and tells Watson to investigate. Inside the empty house Watson, looking through the window, believes that he sees a sniper shoot Holmes in his apartment. Holmes then appears at the house and explains that he put a bust of Julius Caesar there because of the bust's resemblance to his own face  counting on the victims being too terrified to expose the scheme. He befriends Lydia, whom he had seen with Sir George at a restaurant, suspecting that is she in cahoots with Moriarty. She takes him to her house, where he is apparently hypnotized. Moriarty enters and has one of his men cut Holmes with a knife to verify that he is hypnotized. He then tells Holmes to write a suicide note , walk out of Lydia's apartment onto the ledge, and jump to his death. Watson and the police then appear and grab the criminals. Holmes then reveals he was never really hypnotized, but secretly ingested a drug to make him appear as if he had been hypnotized and also insensitive to pain. Moriarty then escapes from the hold of a policeman and jumps from the top of Lydia's house to another building. However, he hangs onto a pipe which becomes loose from the building, causing him to fall to his death. This is the third Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes film in which Moriarty dies. In all three films, he falls to his death. He is always presumed dead until he turns up in the next film.

In it, she was side sitting on the floor with a burning background, with a plate, a pair of scissors and a coral rock laid out at the front of her. She chooses the scissors with her bloody hand and cuts a part of her hair. After seeing a the haunting visage of a white haired creature, she screams and wakes up in her bedroom. Feeling distraught, she calls her boyfriend, Agung . It seems that the dream Sam had was a recurring one, and he responds that he doesn’t know what to do anymore, and Sam hangs up. Her perverted stepfather knocks boisterously on the door, making advances at her. Sam looks at her suitcase and decides to move out once and for all. She finds a boarding house from the newspaper that is situated a bit far from the city, and after walking through an alley, she asks a few Betawi men who were playing cards in a warung for directions. A bit stunned when she asks where the boarding house was, one of the men tells her she should pay her respects to the fenced tree that is situated in the center of the old graveyard near the boarding house. She meets the landlady, Yanti , and she explains that the house used to be the mess of the Mangkoedjiwo Batik factory in its heyday before the factory was burnt down and the workers perished in it, leaving the boarding house the only habitable space within the premises. The great-granddaughter of Panembahan Wiryocakti Mangkoedjiwo and owner of the boarding house, Raden Ayu Sri Sukmarahimi Mangkoedjiwo, now leaves the house open to be rented by local college students and a painting of her as a young lady is hung in the second floor landing. When Yanti took Sam to her rented room, Sam was intrigued by an ornate mirror with the leering head of a wayang sculpted at the top. Sam then mentions the haunted tree to Yanti, to which she digressed as a myth, even though going so far as to explain the characteristics of the Kuntilanak that was said to inhabit the tree and chanting the tembang durmo, a chant that is used to summon the malevolent entity, leaving Sam in a vertiginious state. She then leaves after saying that it wouldn’t make any difference is she chanted it, since the only one who could summon it was a person that had a wangsit, a Javanese term for a supernatural mandate. Agung, struggling with his papers on the subject of dreaming and disturbed by his girlfriend’s recurring dreams, asks for advice from his eccentric friend Iwank . He explains that the dream Sam’s been having does not come from her sub-conscious, but from another realm. He then meets up with Sam and she explains to him her recurring dream. He answers that it has something to do with her fear and worry, and admits that he doesn’t like her new residence. After taking her home and walking her to the boarding house, Agung finds a tile with an intriguing illustration of a root and scissors at the bottom of the fence that surrounds the tree and takes it home. Sam arrives to see one of the house’s tenants, Alfon, apparently a flirtatious braggart psychic, speaking of energies and the supernatural beings residing within the house’s premises to the other tenants. He was enamored at Sam, but Dinda , a brash, bracelet-making tenant Sam had met earlier, calls him a fraud after he read the palm of another tenant, and Sam goes to her room. As she laid in bed, she hears the surreal chanting and apprehensively tries to sleep. The next day, Agung meets up with Iwank as he was playing cards with his friends and tells him to inspect the piece of tile he found near the tree. He then mentions to Iwank that the house was owned by the Mangkoedjiwo family. Iwank’s mother corrects him, saying that it was a black magic sect in the olden days that owned several factories, but since the disapproval of locals erupted, the sect disappeared from the public. Iwank then tells him that Kuntilanaks inhabit trees, but required a medium in order to leave their ethereal condition and enter the human realm, such as antiques in particular. While trying to find her wallet in her room, Sam accidentally turned the chair into facing a wall, breaking a well known taboo in Javanese culture that Yanti pointed out earlier. The aloofness of her relationship with Agung was thickening when she meets up with him, and so he takes her home, only for her to refuse being walked into her boarding house. Later that night, Sam experiences the same dream and sees the Kuntilanak combing her hair whilst sitting in the chair that faced the wall. She then wakes up to hear booming dangdut music coming from the room next to her and knocks on the tenant’s door. The tenant, Mawar, was enraged at Sam for disturbing her and the man she has in his room, claiming that she does it every night. Mawar threatens Sam with scissors and backs her up against a wall. Sam then falls in a trance-like state and chants the durmo, and because of no apparent reason, Mawar has a nosebleed. Dinda was woken up from the commotion along with the other tenants and Bu Yanti and tells Mawar to leave with her boyfriend. Dinda asked her what was wrong, and Sam promptly throws up in the bathroom . Dinda thinks she’s pregnant, and reminds her that next time, she should ask her for some condoms. She falls asleep and wakes up after dreaming that the Kuntilanak had just left her room. She finds her mirror tilted and scratch marks on the door frame, and spots the Kuntilanak going down the hall. She finds Mawar's scissors and follows the Kuntilanak outside, where it disappears. The very next day, Sam, after discovering she had a scar on her shoulder, was informed by Dinda that Mawar had died. She was found by her man after he had left to buy some wine with her head turned backwards and a fan’s propeller had impaled her neck. Yanti, in her office, makes a call to the Raden Ayu Sri Sukma, the owner of the house, if she had heard of the news. Dinda took Sam to her room, where she offerred Sam her handmade bracelets. Sam was suprised to find a mirror similar to hers in Dinda’s room. Dinda then says that there are four mirrors in the house. One in her room, one in Sam’s and one in Ratih’s, failing to remember the fourth one. She then shows her friendliness towards Sam and tells her that she could tell her anything, considering they were both people with broken homes. Agung then came by to see her, and Dinda tells him that she will take good care of Sam. Sam finds something amiss when the house’s servant prepared an offering on the table under Raden Ayu’s portrait. Later that day, Iwank informs Agung that victims of the Kuntilanak had their heads turned backwards and that deepened Agung’s suspicion on Sam’s boarding house. At night, Sam peeks into the second floor door, which Yanti tells her earlier that it’s been closed for a long time and that she shouldn’t poke around it. She spots a vague glimpse of the Kuntilanak, only to be surprised by the sudden flirtatious advances of Alfon. Sam falls yet into another trance, and that freaked him out. Sam throws up maggots once more, and he finds himself with a nosebleed and in a disillusioned state. He takes off with his car, only to find the Kuntilanak sitting next to him and dies when the car crashes into a tree. In the light of recent events, Raden Ayu Sri Sukma , pays the boarding house a visit and paid respects to the tree. She meets up with Yanti and the latter apologizes for presumptuously chanting the durmo. She tells her that it’s fate and the durmo has chosen her, and demands to see Sam. Sam hears of her neighbor’s death, and upon finding a second scar on her shoulder, realizes that she caused his death. Yati and Raden Ayu finds her brooding in the foyer, and Yanti introduces the Raden Ayu to Sam. Agung comes by to see Sam, and the Raden Ayu comments that she has to let go of such a weak human being. Agung and Sam leave, and paid Iwank a visit. She finds a book on Kuntilanaks, and discovers the words ‘Sing kuat sing melihara’  in it. Sam leaves immediately, and Agung follows her out and adresses the problems in their relationship. She angrily exclaims that she needs time, while Agung tells her that he needs her to explain what was going on. He asks for an apology and embraces her. She tries to leave and tells him to leave her alone, and then she fell into a trance and ran away, only to throw up maggots for the third time. She comes home and yells at the tree, telling the Kuntilanak to come out if she dares. The next day, Agung’s mother calls her, telling her that Agung has disappeared. Sam herself has called him numerous times over the course of a few days to no avail. She then hears him calling her one night and searches for him. She was about to open the second floor door where the voice seems to be coming from when Yanti stopped her and angrily tells her to return to her room. Sam goes into Dinda’s room, scaling through the newspaper to see any signs of Agung. Dinda expresses her concern for him, to which Sam responded with an accusation that Dinda likes him. She falls into a trance, and Dinda digresses it as just one of her weird behaviors and leaves to have a shower. The Kuntilanak appears in the bathroom, and she dies when she hits her head against the bathroom wall. As the paramedics took her body, the other tenants began to leave, frightened by the recurring deaths. Now alone in the house, Sam hears Agung’s voice and goes into the second floor room. She finds a variety of occult and macabre objects and a portrait of the Panembahan Sakti Mangkoedjiwo. She finds Agung cowering in a state of terror in front of a mirror . When she was about to leave, she discovers the Raden Ayu waiting for them near the doorway, telling her that she should separate herself from weak human beings. She says that the Mangkoedjiwo legacy has kept the Kuntilanak for decades, and has continually made sacrifices to keep the Kuntilanak under the family’s will. She tells Sam that she has the gift to control the Kuntilanak and will carry on the wangsit. She falls into a trance, but is stopped when Agung persuades her to control herself. The Raden Ayu then tells her that she will teach her how to control her gift. She angrily refuses, to which the Raden Ayu responds by commencing a duel of chanting. Both chanted and the Kuntilanak leaves its arboreal domain. The Raden Ayu lost, experiencing the nose bleed. She pleads with her, saying that she’s not ready to die. She tells her to break all of the mirrors in the house. Sam runs to her room and breaks the mirror with a pair of scissors in accordance to her recurring dream. She breaks the second one, the one in Dinda’s room, with a coral rock, and the third one, in Ratih’s room, with a plate. She then remembers that there’s a fourth mirror in the second floor, and rushes there, only to discover that the Kuntilanak has succesfully crawled out and disappears. She hears vague footsteps of a horse . She finds the Raden Ayu and she pleads with her again. The Kuntilanak appears and breaks the jaws of the Raden Ayu, killing her instantly. The Kuntilanak then cackles as two ghostly young girls eerily tries to push Sam into the mirror. Sam escapes, but is soon cornered by the Kuntilanak. As the Kuntilanak was about to break her jaws, Sam utters the words that she discovered in Iwank’s books, and the Kuntilanak retreats in a backwards fashion into the mirror and disappears. A few days later, Agung, after being treated in the hospital with his injuries, visits Sam in the boarding house, now the sole inhabitant along with Yanti and the servants. Sam then tells him that she loves living in the boarding house, and sings the chant as she walks away, worrying Agung that things have only just begun. The film received a DVD release in 2007. Sequels Kuntilanak 2  and Kuntilanak 3  were released.

She meets up with Yanti and the latter apologizes for presumptuously chanting the durmo. She tells her that it’s fate and the durmo has chosen her, and demands to see Sam. Sam hears of her neighbor’s death, and upon finding a second scar on her shoulder, realizes that she caused his death. Yati and Raden Ayu finds her brooding in the foyer, and Yanti introduces the Raden Ayu to Sam. Agung comes by to see Sam, and the Raden Ayu comments that she has to let go of such a weak human being. Agung and Sam leave, and paid Iwank a visit. She finds a book on Kuntilanaks, and discovers the words ‘Sing kuat sing melihara’  in it. Sam leaves immediately, and Agung follows her out and adresses the problems in their relationship. She angrily exclaims that she needs time, while Agung tells her that he needs her to explain what was going on. He asks for an apology and embraces her. She tries to leave and tells him to leave her alone, and then she fell into a trance and ran away, only to throw up maggots for the third time. She comes home and yells at the tree, telling the Kuntilanak to come out if she dares. The next day, Agung’s mother calls her, telling her that Agung has disappeared. Sam herself has called him numerous times over the course of a few days to no avail. She then hears him calling her one night and searches for him. She was about to open the second floor door where the voice seems to be coming from when Yanti stopped her and angrily tells her to return to her room. Sam goes into Dinda’s room, scaling through the newspaper to see any signs of Agung. Dinda expresses her concern for him, to which Sam responded with an accusation that Dinda likes him. She falls into a trance, and Dinda digresses it as just one of her weird behaviors and leaves to have a shower. The Kuntilanak appears in the bathroom, and she dies when she hits her head against the bathroom wall. As the paramedics took her body, the other tenants began to leave, frightened by the recurring deaths. Now alone in the house, Sam hears Agung’s voice and goes into the second floor room. She finds a variety of occult and macabre objects and a portrait of the Panembahan Sakti Mangkoedjiwo. She finds Agung cowering in a state of terror in front of a mirror . When she was about to leave, she discovers the Raden Ayu waiting for them near the doorway, telling her that she should separate herself from weak human beings. She says that the Mangkoedjiwo legacy has kept the Kuntilanak for decades, and has continually made sacrifices to keep the Kuntilanak under the family’s will. She tells Sam that she has the gift to control the Kuntilanak and will carry on the wangsit. She falls into a trance, but is stopped when Agung persuades her to control herself. The Raden Ayu then tells her that she will teach her how to control her gift. She angrily refuses, to which the Raden Ayu responds by commencing a duel of chanting. Both chanted and the Kuntilanak leaves its arboreal domain. The Raden Ayu lost, experiencing the nose bleed. She pleads with her, saying that she’s not ready to die. She tells her to break all of the mirrors in the house. Sam runs to her room and breaks the mirror with a pair of scissors in accordance to her recurring dream. She breaks the second one, the one in Dinda’s room, with a coral rock, and the third one, in Ratih’s room, with a plate. She then remembers that there’s a fourth mirror in the second floor, and rushes there, only to discover that the Kuntilanak has succesfully crawled out and disappears. She hears vague footsteps of a horse . She finds the Raden Ayu and she pleads with her again. The Kuntilanak appears and breaks the jaws of the Raden Ayu, killing her instantly. The Kuntilanak then cackles as two ghostly young girls eerily tries to push Sam into the mirror. Sam escapes, but is soon cornered by the Kuntilanak. As the Kuntilanak was about to break her jaws, Sam utters the words that she discovered in Iwank’s books, and the Kuntilanak retreats in a backwards fashion into the mirror and disappears. A few days later, Agung, after being treated in the hospital with his injuries, visits Sam in the boarding house, now the sole inhabitant along with Yanti and the servants. Sam then tells him that she loves living in the boarding house, and sings the chant as she walks away, worrying Agung that things have only just begun. The film received a DVD release in 2007. Sequels Kuntilanak 2  and Kuntilanak 3  were released.

While in New Mexico, he is offered another job, delivering a 426 Hemi powered 1970 Dodge Challenger R/T to Salt Lake City, Utah. On the way, he's informed that his wife's already-difficult pregnancy has taken a turn for the worse and continues to head back home to Idaho, refusing to stop for police when flagged down for speeding. An interstate chase develops. Throughout the rest of the journey he is pursued by a relentless Utah sheriff and an FBI agent who, while trying to make a name for himself and the organization after the incidents of Ruby Ridge and the Waco Siege, becomes convinced he is either running drugs or is a domestic terrorist. Kowalski is aided in his flight by a radio shock jock called ""The Voice"" , a libertarian DJ with a Gadsden flag in his studio, who is constantly giving homilies on things such as income taxes and government oppression. The Voice, intrigued by Kowalkski's run across country, sets out to find the truth about Kowalski. As he does so, he discovers the truth of Kowalski's ""drug run"" and that he is really rushing home to be with his wife and her now dangerous pregnancy. Along the way, Kowalski runs into the desert where he gets lost, blows a tire, and spends the night in an Indian reservation. He finds his way back onto the road where he continues on his way to Idaho, tricking the FBI into going the opposite direction of his intended path. However, as the day rides on he falls asleep and drives into the salt flats. A woman on a motorcycle finds him just after he wakes up and informs him that he has damaged his oil pan. He follows her to her hideout where he meets her boyfriend who is at first suspicious that he is from the government. He is hiding from the IRS. After the girl and Kowalski convince him he is 'one of them', he offers to ride 30 miles to try and locate a replacement oil pan. He arrives back after successfully finding one but also warns Kowalski that the roads and intersections are teeming with police and agents. After they help Kowalski fit the pan they offer to help him with a plan to run a roadblock. Kowalski successfully gets through the roadblock by having flashing police lights mounted on the roof and rushing at the roadblock; in the dimming light the police think its another police car and hurriedly let him through. However an officer fires a shot at the retreating Challenger and blows out the rear screen. Afterwards Kowalski shuts off his headlights and vanishes into the woods, using night vision goggles he bought from the guy with the scanner. The police helicopter has infrared detectors but Kowalski evades being seen by hiding the car under a large piece of tin. He wakes up from a nightmare about his wife at 7:19 a.m., finds a phone booth and calls the hospital, speaking to the same doctor as previously. Kowalski then drives down the road to where the movie began. Upon seeing the roadblock, he stops where we first see him in the beginning. A flashback reveals that his wife died at 7:19 a.m. after her kidneys failed. He then drives his car into the roadblock at full speed. An epilogue by ""The Voice"" reveals that although the authorities claim he died in the crash, the body was never found and that some witnesses claim he bailed out just before the crash and escaped authorities with the help of sympathetic onlookers. A scenario is given where his former Mexican friend finds his tags and shows he is now living in the wilderness with his newborn daughter."

Although the Rayadu is married , he has a mistress. Rayadu comes to find out that his assistant and his mistress are married and has been cheating him out of his money for a long time. He finds the assistant’s stash of diamonds and takes it. After spending some time with his wife and kids, Rayadu gets a change of heart and decides to expose his and his assistant’s illegal activities. Before he leaves, he hides the diamonds inside one of his children’s toys. His assistant finds out, murders Rayadu in a fit of rage and stores the body in a freezer. Panicking that soon people will realize that the Mayor is missing, he notices Rayadu's younger lookalike, Chandram  in a mental institution. Deducting that Chandram is faking his mental breakdown to beat a murder charge and avoid jail, they blackmail Chandram into playing the Mayor till a major deal is completed and the assistant gets a lot of money. Chandram is promised freedom if he is successful. Chandram learns Rayadu’s speech and mannerisms and with heavy prosthetics and make up, becomes a suitable double for the Mayor. Meanwhile, an investigative reporter  is trying to expose the Mayor for his illegal activities but she hasn’t found any real evidence yet. As she almost comes close to exposing the identity of Chandram mistakenly, the assistant sends goons to kill her. Chandram, having heard this, removes his disguise, sneaks out and saves the reporter from the goon. When the reporter gets suspicious about the resemblance between him and the Mayor, Chandram lies that he is the Mayor’s son who doesn’t like his father’s illegal ways. The assistant’s search for his diamonds using Chandram proves futile. The reporter decides to charm Chandram to get real evidence of the Mayor’s illegal activities and flirts with him and they try to meet many times. This leads to hilarious situations in which Chandram has to sneak out without the assistant’s knowledge. The assistant tries to kill her one more time, but Chandram, again saves her but his cover is blown. Both are on the run from the corrupt police and the assistant. Chandram finally reveals the truth about his murder charge to the reporter. He used to be a singer and a dancer. A corrupt politician, on the pretext of helping him and his female dance partner become famous invites them to a hotel room. While the politician sends Chandram on an errand run, he brutally rapes and murders the female dancer and uses his influence to put the blame on Chandram. Chandram is found guilty but during trial, he fakes mental retardation and is put in the mental institution. The reporter and Chandram then falls for each other. Tired of running, they hatch a plan to stop the assistant and the politician who murdered the female dancer,who also happens to be the assistant’s partner. Chandram, goes back to the crowded market that he sold in the beginning of the movie, and proclaims that he will give the land back to the people and expose illegal activities he had committed with his assistant, in a big public gathering soon. The assistant, realizing that if he killed the mayor he would become the first suspect, searches for a way to get the upper hand. He traces down Chandran’s mother, kidnaps her and uses this as a leverage to blackmail Chandram into not doing anything silly at the public meeting. The day before the meeting, since the Mayor’s children wanted to spend time with their father, Chandram impersonates the Mayor and play with the kids. He accidentally finds the diamonds and leaves clues so that the children could find it in the future. On the day of the meeting, a huge crowd is built up to hear the speech and it is attended by prominent ministers. Chandram, impersonating Rajendran, is being held on a close watch by the assistant. With the help of the reporter and her father, he finds the location where his mother is being held captive by the corrupt politician who had sent him to jail. He weasels into the car of a prominent minister who asks the assistant to use a different vehicle. Finally free from the assistants view, Chandram uses the opportunity to leave and rescue his mother and the corrupt politician gets killed in the process. Chandram comes back to the minister’s vehicle just in time as the vehicle reaches the press conference, so the assistant doesn’t suspect anything. During the press conference, Chandram details all the illegal activities he had committed along with his assistant and other politicians and businessmen with evidence. Just as he finishes his speech, he is shot by an unknown assailant. Chandram turns to his assistant and blames him before he collapses and dies. The crowd of people become agitated and beats the assistant. An ambulance comes and picks up the Mayor’s body. In the ambulance, Chandram gets up seemingly unharmed. The ambulance is driven by the reporter’s father and he was the unknown assassin. The faux assassination was a distraction to let everyone think that Chandram/Mayor is dead. They then reveal the real body of the Mayor inside the ambulance. They drive the ambulance into a power grid after jumping out of the vehicle. The ambulance explodes with the real Mayor’s body inside and to everyone concerned; the Mayor was killed by the assistant during the press conference. Chandram, then walks away to start a new life with the reporter.

However, Spike is horrified when, through the constant chases of Tom and Jerry, Tyke ends up getting dirty by falling into a muddy puddle. Spike grabs Tom and scolds him that if Tyke isn't clean at all, the feline will be in trouble with the law. Tom quickly rushes off with the muddy pup and returns almost instantly with Tyke cleaned up. Tom grudgingly agrees to look after the pup and ensure his cleanliness until Spike returns, Jerry of course being ready to sabotage this. As Tom sits down on the same wooden platform that Tyke is lying on, one of the wooden planks catapults Tyke into the air, and Tom narrowly saves Tyke from falling into the same muddy puddle. Tom overhears Jerry's laughter and chases after him. Jerry quickly stops the cat, and challenges him to a game of tic-tac-toe on Tyke's back. Tom wins and resumes chasing Jerry, before suddenly realizing what he's done, and promptly returns to Tyke to rub off his pencil marks. Jerry hurls a tomato at Tom, but Tom quickly ducks so that it avoids him. Realizing that it will hit Tyke instead he yelps with fear and Tom rushes back and stands directly in front of the pup so that the tomato does hit him after all. The chase resumes until Tyke ends up with a jar of ink spilled on him. Tom panics after seeing Tyke covered in ink and attempts to rub the ink off but fails. Tom grabs some paint tins, painting Tyke first white, then gray, but Jerry pushes the paint containers so that Tom ends up dipping his paintbrush into a variety of different colors. Tyke has now been painted a multi-colored mess of reds, blues, greens and yellows. Horrified, Tom grabs a hose so that he can wash the paint off, but Jerry connects the other end of the hosepipe to a large container of tar. Out of the hosepipe comes thick, black, sticky tar. Tom sees that Spike is approaching, and decides he had better act quickly. Tom spots a pillow hanging on a washing line, and stuffs Tyke into it and takes him out, which leaves Tyke covered in feathers. He then places a red glove on Tyke's head and a clothes peg on his mouth, so that Tyke crudely resembles a chicken of sorts. Spike is surprisingly fooled and walks off. However, Tyke removes the peg from his mouth and bites Tom's tail. Tom screams in pain and alerts Spike, causing him to turn and investigate. Tom rushes off and hides in the laundry room, putting Tyke inside a washing machine. Tom however is too late to do anything; just as he is adding soap flakes, Spike stops him and takes Tyke out of the washing machine. Catching on to what had happened to Tyke, an angry Spike pours the box of soap flakes over Tom's head and shoves a soap bar in his mouth before he shoves Tom in the washing machine and slams the door on him. Now Tom ends up taking a shower around the washing machine as Spike and Tyke look on. Both of them are joined by Jerry, who waves at the cat as the cartoon closes.

K.R.Vijaya, the mother of the family, raises him as one of the family even though others outside the family see his as a servant. Relatives and friends of the family see Kamal as a thorn in their plans to control the wealth of the family. Manipulating Vijaya’s son, they accuse Kamal of theft and throw him out of the house. Even though Vijaya and her husband don’t believe others, they are forced by their offsprings. Kamal works very hard and becomes rich on his own. Meanwhile, the Vijaya’s family is manipulated by others for money. Kamal helps his brothers and sisters recover for the setbacks and finally re-unite the entire family back into one roof again.

Ambika and Radha are sisters and are heirs to a wealthy business. Ambika looks after the business after their parents died while Radha is a student. Kamal meets Radha and soon they fall in love with each other while Ambika has sworn off all men.Jaishankar is their uncle who is after their wealth. When Radha brings Kamal home to meet her sister, both Kamal and Ambika have a big fight which ends is Ambika forbidding Radha from seeing Kamal ever again. Ambika then reveals the reason behind the fight. Years earlier, Kamal and Ambika were classmates and Ambika had a crush on him which Kamal never reciprocated. While on a class trip, Ambika gives a note to Kamal that asks him to meet her in his room. Ambika claims that, that night, Kamal entered her room and both had consensual sex, but Kamal denied it and refused to marry her. So she bought up rape charges against him and sent him to prison. But soon the truth comes out. During the class trip, Kamal never received the note which fell on Jaishankar’s son, Raj kumar, who was also their classmate. Raj, lusting after Ambika, uses this opportunity to enter Ambika’s room on the pretext of being Kamal and has sex with her. Since Raj disconnected electricity in her room and the room was very dark, Ambika didn’t know the difference. Kamal, forgives Ambika and gets back with Radha while the bad guys are punished. The movie paired Ambika and her real-life sister Radha in roles of sisters on-screen. Nadia was first offered the role of the younger sister. She refused it and the role went to Radha. The two sisters delivered stunning performances that are fondly remembered by a generation of fans. Ambika played the role of a young and beautiful, yet strong and single woman with aplomb. In this role she plays a dominating business tycoon with a powerful personality. She portrays a controlling and protective older sister for younger Radha, while simultaneously demonstrating a highly glamorous and desirable personality herself. Very soon, in a flashback, she displays a totally different personality as a pretty and carefree college girl, switching between the two roles effortlessly. The director does a beautiful job of selecting scenes that portray all the varying aspects of Ambika's varied persona in the movie, such as a scene that puts her in a corporate boss role, a scene that has her questioning her sister protectively, a scene that shows her caring side in a poor children's home and a scene that underscores her youth and physical beauty in the dressing room. Radha also looks her best in the movie, an actress at the height of her commercial success, totally confident and comfortable about pairing up with her more experienced sister. She refuses to be overshadowed by her elder sister in the movie and comes across as a distinct and talented actress. This is surely one movie where Kamal's role and performance pales in comparison to the collective power of an outstanding performance by two of the greatest and most beautiful actresses in South.

This is surely one movie where Kamal's role and performance pales in comparison to the collective power of an outstanding performance by two of the greatest and most beautiful actresses in South.

Ambika and Radha are sisters and are heirs to a wealthy business. Ambika looks after the business after their parents died while Radha is a student. Kamal meets Radha and soon they fall in love with each other while Ambika has sworn off all men.Jaishankar is their uncle who is after their wealth. When Radha brings Kamal home to meet her sister, both Kamal and Ambika have a big fight which ends is Ambika forbidding Radha from seeing Kamal ever again. Ambika then reveals the reason behind the fight. Years earlier, Kamal and Ambika were classmates and Ambika had a crush on him which Kamal never reciprocated. While on a class trip, Ambika gives a note to Kamal that asks him to meet her in his room. Ambika claims that, that night, Kamal entered her room and both had consensual sex, but Kamal denied it and refused to marry her. So she bought up rape charges against him and sent him to prison. But soon the truth comes out. During the class trip, Kamal never received the note which fell on Jaishankar’s son, Raj kumar, who was also their classmate. Raj, lusting after Ambika, uses this opportunity to enter Ambika’s room on the pretext of being Kamal and has sex with her. Since Raj disconnected electricity in her room and the room was very dark, Ambika didn’t know the difference. Kamal, forgives Ambika and gets back with Radha while the bad guys are punished. The movie paired Ambika and her real-life sister Radha in roles of sisters on-screen. Nadia was first offered the role of the younger sister. She refused it and the role went to Radha. The two sisters delivered stunning performances that are fondly remembered by a generation of fans. Ambika played the role of a young and beautiful, yet strong and single woman with aplomb. In this role she plays a dominating business tycoon with a powerful personality. She portrays a controlling and protective older sister for younger Radha, while simultaneously demonstrating a highly glamorous and desirable personality herself. Very soon, in a flashback, she displays a totally different personality as a pretty and carefree college girl, switching between the two roles effortlessly. The director does a beautiful job of selecting scenes that portray all the varying aspects of Ambika's varied persona in the movie, such as a scene that puts her in a corporate boss role, a scene that has her questioning her sister protectively, a scene that shows her caring side in a poor children's home and a scene that underscores her youth and physical beauty in the dressing room. Radha also looks her best in the movie, an actress at the height of her commercial success, totally confident and comfortable about pairing up with her more experienced sister. She refuses to be overshadowed by her elder sister in the movie and comes across as a distinct and talented actress. This is surely one movie where Kamal's role and performance pales in comparison to the collective power of an outstanding performance by two of the greatest and most beautiful actresses in South.

In the past, he has had a lot of difficulty creating and maintaining relationships . He has a difficult relationship with his mother, Blanca ([[Teresa Gutierrez , who detests him and treats him with no respect. Due to his mother, he always has problems, especially with his neighbor and landlord Beatriz , who is always asking him for money for his rent and for the support of the Colombian Army and the people displaced by violence, which he refuses, rudely saying, ""They're all cowards, they don't know what a real soldier is like and I'm not interested."" Offended by his refusal, his neighbor begins to tell everyone that Eliseo is a bad person. Eventually Eliseo is not welcome anywhere, and in a scene at the local store, they treat him rudely and make it clear that he is not welcome inside the store. This is one of the biggest factors contributing to Eliseo going mad, but it is not the only reason. The other reason, was because he fell in love with Natalia , his 15-year-old English student who lived in a very wealthy part of the city. Eliseo fell in love with Natalia because of her gentle, studious, and polite nature during lessons. For Eliseo, this small bit of kindness gives him hope that she could reciprocate his feelings. Eventually, he starts giving her gifts and starts to look forward more and more to seeing her again. However, this all changes when he is invited, and goes to, Natalia's birthday party; once there he realizes that Natalia has a boyfriend named Esteban , and as she ignores Eliseo through the whole party , he is heartbroken. All of his stress and failures finally become too much, and he decides to go on a killing spree. After a heated argument with his mother, he loses his temper and shoots her in the living room. After she is dead, he sets the body alight, a slight grin spreading on his face. When the fire begins to spread, he runs out of the apartment, shouting, ""Fire! Fire!"". When Vicky, the neighbor causing all the problems, walks out of her apartment, he shoots her. He also kills someone else on the stairs. Right after leaving the building, he heads anxiously for Natalia's house. When he arrives at the house, he acts normally and talks with her mother. He kills Natalia and her mother, viciously attacking one, then the other. At some point in the evening, he goes to the house of an old friend. He tells her that he is leaving town and thanks her for her friendship. From there, he goes on the last leg of his killing spree, the high class restaurant, ""Pozzetto"". He chooses an expensive meal and a few drinks, and consumes them both. He pays the bill leaving a big tip. Then, he goes into the bathroom and prepares himself for the upcoming massacre. When he comes out, he shoots the restaurant's pianist. Next, he begins to shoot anyone trying to escape. One of the people he shoots is a new waitress who has just begun her first day of work. The second story consists that of Paola , an attractive young woman who hates her job in the marketplace. After accepting a better offer, she becomes a member of a gang of robbers, acting as a decoy to drug and rob wealthy men's money, by putting Scopolamine in their drinks and then luring them into a cab where they'd do the ""Paseo Millonario"". Her story embodies the social and urban violence of life in Bogotá, Colombia. As the movie goes on, after another night of robbing wealthy men, she grabs a cab ride home. Unfortunately, she ends up in the hands of two rapists who kidnap her and assault her at an old taxi shop. Afterwards, she is traumatized and eventually asks members of the gang she joined, to kill the two people that raped her. Feeling sorry for the deaths of the two rapists and all the robberies committed before, she quits the gang and gets a job as a waitress at one of the finest restaurants in Bogotá, ""Pozzetto"". The third story consists that of Padre Ernesto, a tormented and libidinous priest. He is in a passionate and love-filled affair with his housekeeper, who is tormented by the bearing of the brunt of the secrecy of a woman in her community. This woman, who murders her three children ""to release"" of life , appears in the first part of the movie in a scene that serves to anticipate and prepare for the final slaughter at the end of the movie. But her stay in prison and its diabolical possession make her a spokesperson for theories, theses and obvious symbols for the future events. In the end, Ernesto cannot stop to refuse his carnal instincts towards his housekeeper and is too traumatized by the woman in the prison that he eventually loses his faith and refuses to go on as a priest. So right after he left he completely quit as a priest and invited his housekeeper to the restaurant named Pozzetto for a date but is unfortunately killed along with his date by Eliseo."

The boys would love to have a dog but are not allowed, Grandaddy holding that ""ye canna eat a dog"". Then they find an abandoned baby. Living in fear of Grandaddy , they conceal the child from the adults. They see the baby as a kind of substitute for the dog they have been denied . Grandaddy is having problems with the Dutch settlers who have arrived at the settlement in increasing numbers after leaving South Africa at the end of the Boer War. He has had a long-running dispute with Afrikaner Jan Hooft over ownership of a hill and refuses to accept a legal ruling that the land, in fact, belongs to Hooft. He also keeps a close rein on his grown-up daughter Kirsty  and is reluctant for her to make a life for herself. Kirsty is in love with the local doctor Willem Bloem, who left Holland for Canada for reasons he will not disclose. He does not return Kirsty's affections. To make matters worse, it turns out that the ""kidnapped"" baby is Hooft's younger daughter. When found out, Harry is tried at a court set up in the local trading store. He is suspected of taking the child as a result of the tensions between the two families but states that he did not know the identity of the baby. Surprisingly, Hooft speaks up in his defense, stating that no harm had come to the baby and his daughter should have been looking after it. The court official suggests that Harry be sent to a corrective school, and is immediately threatened with shooting by Grandaddy. The clerk climbs down, merely suggesting an investigation into the location of these schools in case a further kidnapping should occur. Afterwards, Grandaddy thanks Hooft for speaking up for Harry. The film ends with Grandaddy  instructing Harry to write to a mail order company to order the red setter they had set their hearts on. He had found the flyer for the dog in one of his best boots, where the boys had hidden it. They had noticed that he sometimes walked without these boots, slinging them over his shoulder, to save wear and tear. To pay for the dog, Grandaddy had sold the boots – a prized item among his few possessions. Davy is now able to say, ""I think we'll call him Rover, Harry."" One of the film's most memorable moments comes with the horror on Duncan Macrae's face at what his grandchild must have thought of him when the little boy implores ""Don't eat the babbie""."

With nowhere to go, the despondent baby woodpecker wanders around the garden, where he comes across an unsuspecting Tom, who is sitting in a deckchair, drinking and reading a magazine. The woodpecker carelessly pecks slightly at the deckchair's leg. An irritated Tom pours his drink onto the woodpecker, who then proceeds to peck through the entire leg of the deckchair, causing it to fold up with Tom still sitting on it, which causes him to swallow the glass he was holding in his hand. Mayhem ensues. Tom begins to chase the bird, who screeches for Mama. Jerry emerges from his mouse hole and decides to intervene, stopping Tom with a rake. However Tom manages to grab hold of the rake, trapping Jerry in the process, who cannot run away. The woodpecker pecks off the end of the rake, allowing Jerry to run off, and sending Tom hurtling backwards into a mailbox. Tom hurls the long remainder of the rake handle at Jerry and the bird, but the bird quickly pecks it down to a stub. In the ensuing chase, Tom swallows the bird. The bird pecks deep inside Tom's stomach, which vibrates violently. Tom drinks from a bucket of water hoping to drown the bird, only for the water to seep out through tiny holes in his body. Jerry knocked Tom's tail which makes him cringe and yelp in pain and the woodpecker eventually pecks his way out through Tom's teeth, and as Jerry runs off, he runs straight into an axe and is knocked out cold. As Tom attempts to disembowel Jerry, the woodpecker continually pecks at the cat's head. Tom grabs the woodpecker in his hand and corks his beak, rendering the woodpecker useless at attacking him. Tom then ties the woodpecker to a telegraph pole. However, the woodpecker manages to free himself, and noticing that Jerry has very little time to escape, quickly performs a complicated calculation in order to stop Tom and rescue Jerry. The woodpecker pecks away at the telegraph pole, which comes crashing down onto Tom's head, and then repeatedly pushes him down into the ground. The baby woodpecker finally locates his mother.Jerry is thankful for the woodpecker's help. However, the mother woodpecker flies into the scene. The baby woodpecker realizes just who his mother is after all, and is whisked away by his mother. Jerry realizes that he will miss his avian companion more than he thought he would. Just then, the baby woodpecker flies back to Jerry, gives him a big kiss and flies away again, as Jerry waves him off happily

Staggering in the middle of the road from the beating by the thieves, he is then struck by a car driving by a woman named Oom. Feeling sorry for him, Oom brings the man to her apartment and gives him shelter. The man, it turns out, has developed amnesia. Based the name on a pendant the man is wearing – his only possession – Oom names him Tan. A doctor's examination reveals that Tan is uninjured except that he can't remember anything about his life prior to being struck by Oom's car. Tan is given a journal and urged to free associate in an effort to recall his past life. Oom is experiencing trouble in her own life. She has recently broken up with her domineering boyfriend, Krit, whom she still sees at her workplace, where she is a creative director for an advertising agency. Oom is also had motherhood thrust upon her, since she is caring for her nephew, the son of her dead sister. Initially, having Tan around adds stress to the situation, and when Tan reorganizes her stacks of magazines, and interferes in her disciplining of Ohm, she is angry. But Tan proves useful around the apartment. He is looked up to as a father figure by Ohm. And for Oom, he builds up the self esteem and confidence she lost in her relationship with Krit. Tan seems to instinctively know things about feminimity, such as what dress Oom should wear and what shade of lipstick is appropriate. As a family unit with Oom and Ohm, Tan goes to an amusement park and defends Oom after he gets in trouble for fighting in school, with the result being Tan getting punched by the other boy's father. While visions of his past nag him, Tan seems perfectly happy with Oom and Ohm, especially after he becomes romantically involved with Oom. ""I don't want to remember anymore. I want to be like this with you here, forever,"" he tells Oom one night as they watch the sunset from a ledge outside her apartment. Eventually the memories of the past catch up with Tan. Taking some numbers he wrote in his journal, he retraces his steps to the scene of the car accident, and eventually finds the numbers are an address to a house. The home belongs to a man whom Tan had a homosexual relationship with, but since the man is married to a woman and has a family, he must keep the relationship secret. Meanwhile, the police call Oom. They have some items recovered from the thieves who attacked Tan on the night he was struck by her car. Among the items is a mobile phone. The police have already called the number, and Tan's friends from Phuket on their way to Bangkok to claim the phone and find out more about their missing friend. The friends, it turns out, are all katoey dancers in a transvestite cabaret, where Tan was the star attraction."

Slammer , with no idea that a Soviet warship is anchored just off the coast, and despite the violent storm, gung-ho intelligence officer Sulock ignores the captain and drags radioman Mischa Pushkin and his comrade Boris into a raft to row ashore and accept a prototype surveillance device from an American traitor. The exchange fails when the raft capsizes and Mischa washes ashore. Injured and alone, Mischa shouts out for his missing comrades, then realizing with shock that he's in America. The next morning, Danny hears from his little sister that their parents are downstairs finalizing their divorce. He sneaks out of the house, rescues Adam from his mother's cooking and Jason from his father's lawnmowing orders, and the three of them set out in their motorboat for their 'hideout', an uninhabited island with an abandoned naval bunker. On the way, they find a Russian codebook from one of the sailors and later the wrecked raft. Fearing that Russians are invading, Adam and Jason head back to the city and leave Danny to secure their bunker. Danny nervously enters the bunker and finds himself held at gunpoint by a frightened Mischa. He'd been in there all night munching their candy bars and reading their Sgt. Slammer comic books, which he calls ""American propaganda"". Unable to warn anyone of the suspected invasion, Adam and Jason return and overpower Mischa, due to his dislocated shoulder and the fact that his gun hasn't worked since he crawled out of the ocean. Following Geneva Convention rules, the boys interrogate Mischa, who has no idea why he's here and admits he wound up in their hideout by accident. Danny is dead-set on turning Mischa over to the police, while Adam is more interested in being diplomatic, even trying to fix Mischa's hurt shoulder, but with no medical training, they enlist the help of Adam's nursing-student sister Diane, who falls for Mischa at first sight. After lunch at a local McDonald's, tensions flare over what to do next, but Jason sides with Adam that as he has no anti-American agenda, Mischa should not be turned in. Mischa buys some American clothes and the four spend the Fourth of July messing around at the racetrack, arcade, mini-golf, and batting cages. Later in the day, Adam goes off to maintain his cover story to his father, but before Jason can leave, they run into Raimy, a drunken Army corporal causing trouble on the Key West docks. Mischa impulsively intercedes, and they nearly come to blows before the MP's turn up and haul Raimy back to base. Mischa berates himself, realizing he nearly committed what could be an act of war, and admits to the boys that perhaps he should give himself up after all. Fearing for Mischa now, Danny concocts a plan for the boys to borrow a pleasurecraft from the marina and deliver their friend to Cuba, where he might find his way home. Getting help from Diane again, they learn that their parents went to their bunker, finding both the interrogation tape, and Mischa's  gun. While the boys make final arrangements, Diane and Mischa share a romantic moment watching the fireworks from the dock, unaware that they're being watched. Danny's plan goes bust when Raimy and his drunken cronies intercept them on the way to commandeer the boat, and while they defeat the drunks easily, they're delayed long enough for the boat to be taken out without them. Thinking Mischa's at a dead end, they are suddenly surprised to be greeted by Sulock and Boris, who survived the capsizing after all, and they have a Russian submarine on the way to pick them up after midnight. But Sulock is hiding something... Once Adam and Jason leave to borrow another boat for the rendezvous, Sulock pulls a gun on Danny, ordering Mischa and Boris to tie him up, or else. Danny thinks that Mischa has betrayed them because he doesn't understand a word of the Russian being shouted in the scuffle. Sulock shoves Mischa and Boris out of the boathouse at gunpoint, planning to break into the army base and steal the surveillance device. This will complete his mission, but could very well frighten the Americans into thinking they're being invaded! Mischa trips an alarm after begging Sulock not to go through with this potential act of war, and flee back to the boathouse with a trigger-happy Raimy and the MP's on their tail. Out searching for the boys, their parents nearly run the Russians down, and Diane inadvertently reveals everything when she recognizes Mischa. Sulock orders everyone into the borrowed boat, except Danny, who is still tied up. Mischa unties Danny and begs him to find help so no one is killed. Trying to phone the police, Danny witnesses Raimy acting without authority and commandeering the boat of his drinking buddies to chase down and kill the Russians, particularly Mischa. Stumbling across the van of a local performer who often impersonates Sgt. Slammer, Danny takes his jetpack and flies out over the ocean, hoping to reach his friends before Raimy and warn them. Arriving at the rendezvous point, Adam, Jason and the Russians are quickly in Raimy's drunken gunsights, but the parents arrive, Raimy's CO ordering him to hold fire. Raimy soon ignores orders when Danny flies over in the jetpack and shoots him down, then shoots Mischa as he dives into the water to rescue Danny. Free of the jetpack, Danny surfaces and pleads for his father not to take him to the boat, but save the wounded Mischa. Once all three of them are safe on the boat the Russian Alfa surfaces and its sailors draw their guns, fearing their comrades are about to be killed. Sulock cowardly puts his gun to Adam's head to protect no one but himself, but Diane and Danny's father stand in front of Mischa, ready to take Raimy's bullet for him. After a few minutes filled with shouts from all three to lower their guns, the standoff ends peacefully, Raimy having fired the only shots. Early the next morning, the traitor is arrested by MP's , while out on the water, both Raimy and Sulock are arrested by their respective militaries, each facing a court-martial for nearly triggering World War III . Danny's father and Mischa embrace in mutual gratitude, while Diane receives a romantic farewell. Mischa is the last Russian to enter the submarine, saying goodbye to his young friends and fervently hoping he and the boys will meet again. Danny's voice is heard as the Americans watch the Russian submarine dive away, and the final scene shows Danny in his bedroom, reading War And Peace  to Adam and Jason."

The ""Mermaid"" Mora , who lives in a hotel above the marina merry-go-round  and Johnny fall for each other. Everyone around them is wary of the romance, as her previous lovers have died mysteriously. Mora believes she is a descendant of the Sirens, mythic sea creatures who lure sailors to their deaths. From time to time a mysterious and seemingly sinister woman  appears and frightens Mora. She believes the woman is the leader of the mermaids, calling Mora to fulfill her destiny. Mora's origins seem to be driving her to commit murder by the full moon. Johnny is unable to believe his lover is capable of murder, but Mora herself seems more certain. During a diving trip on the day of the full moon, Mora cuts Johnny's breathing tube and he is forced to surface, leaving her below, where she swims away into the shadows. When Johnny returns to the marina the next day, he sees that the lifeless body of Mora is now on display in the mermaid tank. Murdock appears, brandishing a gun. It is he who has been committing the murders and convincing Mora that she was an actual mermaid. Mora had discarded her oxygen tank in the sea, and had drowned. In the ensuing struggle between Johnny and Murdock, the glass tank is shattered, and the water and debris pin Murdock down. In the film's conclusion, at the police station, Murdock confesses to the crimes and Johnny returns to his ship accompanied by the shore patrol. The one loose end to Murdock's story is that he denies any knowledge of the mysterious woman who had been frightening Mora. The police dismiss it as the man protecting her, but the door is left open to other possibilities."

As she dresses, she receives a telegram from her fiancee Col. Brewton  ordering her to board the train for Salt Fork, New Mexico to marry him there instead. The first person she meets in the town is Brice Chamberlain , who warns her that she is bound for unhappiness with Brewton. He takes her over to the courthouse where she witnesses Brewton testifying against a settler who had tried to stake a claim to part of Brewton's cattle ranch. Back at his ranch, Brewton takes her out to see the sweeping plain of grass and explains how he had settled it, fighting with the Indians for the land and making it fit for ranching. He opposed the settlers because he knew the land did not get enough rain to sustain farming. Lutie struggles to see what Brewton sees in the grasses, but she tries to make the most of her new home. She convinces Brewton to allow a family of settlers onto the ranch, because she had befriended one of them. Brewton warns her that the settlers will not last more than six months, due to some unforeseeable, but certain, circumstance. When Lutie visits the settlers as they build their sod house, she is surprised to see Chamberlain. He is visiting the settlers because he helped them file their claim on Brewton's land. He rides with Lutie on her way back home and confesses his attraction to her. Lutie similarly confesses her ongoing struggles to adapt to her new home and her husband's emotional distance. Lutie gives birth to a daughter, Sara Beth. During a great blizzard, the settlers are alarmed by the sound of Brewton's cattle near their house. Fearful for his wheat crop, knowing its destruction would spell the ruin of his farm, the man runs out of the house with his rifle to scare off the cattle. When they stampede, he shoots one of the cows, and he also hits one of Brewton's workers, who were busy trying to herd the cattle in the storm. The rest of the ranch hands severely beat the man. His pregnant wife wades out into the storm to help him inside. The exertion makes her lose the baby. When Lutie learns of the incident with the settlers, she races out to their house, but they refuse to see her. With the crop and their baby lost, they are broken and concede the land to Brewton. Brewton takes the news in stride, telling Lutie that he had warned her something like this would happen. Furious at his callousness, Lutie decides to leave Salt Fork for a while. She goes to Denver, and she is planning to return to St. Louis when she runs into Chamberlain. The two have a discreet affair, which convinces Lutie that it would be a mistake to leave Brewton. Back at Salt Fork, she gives birth to a boy named Brock, and she continues her struggle to find a place in Brewton's world. Chamberlain successfully lobbies for a Federal District Court in Salt Fork, and he wins election as a judge, presiding over all land disputes. Brewton knows that this will mean a steady stream of settlers on his land. As he arms himself and his men to ward off the settlers, Lutie pleads with him to reconsider. In the abandoned sod house, as Brewton prepares his ammunition, he gets Lutie to confess to the affair with Chamberlain. She agrees to leave, but Brewton refuses to let her take the children. Back in St. Louis, she consults a lawyer who tells her that if she will admit in court that Chamberlain is Brock's father she could win custody of her son, but she would certainly lose custody of Sara Beth. Convinced it would do more harm than good to fight, Lutie stays away. She returns after two years in a futile attempt to reconnect with her children, who do not recognize her. Chamberlain tries to get her to fight for Brock's custody so they can run away together as a family, but Lutie admits that she does not have enough love for Chamberlain to marry him. As the years pass, the town doctor keeps Lutie informed about her children through letters. On his deathbed, he chides Brewton for being too emotionally distant from Lutie and driving her away. After his death, Chamberlain takes up the correspondence with Lutie, acknowledging that he expects nothing in return.

As she dresses, she receives a telegram from her fiancee Col. Brewton  ordering her to board the train for Salt Fork, New Mexico to marry him there instead. The first person she meets in the town is Brice Chamberlain , who warns her that she is bound for unhappiness with Brewton. He takes her over to the courthouse where she witnesses Brewton testifying against a settler who had tried to stake a claim to part of Brewton's cattle ranch. Back at his ranch, Brewton takes her out to see the sweeping plain of grass and explains how he had settled it, fighting with the Indians for the land and making it fit for ranching. He opposed the settlers because he knew the land did not get enough rain to sustain farming. Lutie struggles to see what Brewton sees in the grasses, but she tries to make the most of her new home. She convinces Brewton to allow a family of settlers onto the ranch, because she had befriended one of them. Brewton warns her that the settlers will not last more than six months, due to some unforeseeable, but certain, circumstance. When Lutie visits the settlers as they build their sod house, she is surprised to see Chamberlain. He is visiting the settlers because he helped them file their claim on Brewton's land. He rides with Lutie on her way back home and confesses his attraction to her. Lutie similarly confesses her ongoing struggles to adapt to her new home and her husband's emotional distance. Lutie gives birth to a daughter, Sara Beth. During a great blizzard, the settlers are alarmed by the sound of Brewton's cattle near their house. Fearful for his wheat crop, knowing its destruction would spell the ruin of his farm, the man runs out of the house with his rifle to scare off the cattle. When they stampede, he shoots one of the cows, and he also hits one of Brewton's workers, who were busy trying to herd the cattle in the storm. The rest of the ranch hands severely beat the man. His pregnant wife wades out into the storm to help him inside. The exertion makes her lose the baby. When Lutie learns of the incident with the settlers, she races out to their house, but they refuse to see her. With the crop and their baby lost, they are broken and concede the land to Brewton. Brewton takes the news in stride, telling Lutie that he had warned her something like this would happen. Furious at his callousness, Lutie decides to leave Salt Fork for a while. She goes to Denver, and she is planning to return to St. Louis when she runs into Chamberlain. The two have a discreet affair, which convinces Lutie that it would be a mistake to leave Brewton. Back at Salt Fork, she gives birth to a boy named Brock, and she continues her struggle to find a place in Brewton's world. Chamberlain successfully lobbies for a Federal District Court in Salt Fork, and he wins election as a judge, presiding over all land disputes. Brewton knows that this will mean a steady stream of settlers on his land. As he arms himself and his men to ward off the settlers, Lutie pleads with him to reconsider. In the abandoned sod house, as Brewton prepares his ammunition, he gets Lutie to confess to the affair with Chamberlain. She agrees to leave, but Brewton refuses to let her take the children. Back in St. Louis, she consults a lawyer who tells her that if she will admit in court that Chamberlain is Brock's father she could win custody of her son, but she would certainly lose custody of Sara Beth. Convinced it would do more harm than good to fight, Lutie stays away. She returns after two years in a futile attempt to reconnect with her children, who do not recognize her. Chamberlain tries to get her to fight for Brock's custody so they can run away together as a family, but Lutie admits that she does not have enough love for Chamberlain to marry him. As the years pass, the town doctor keeps Lutie informed about her children through letters. On his deathbed, he chides Brewton for being too emotionally distant from Lutie and driving her away.

They sell the dog to wreak havoc in the hope Satan will overcome good once and for all. The dog acts very strangely when they bring it home, leading the father and the family maid to believe there is something wrong with the dog. The dad believes so after the maid is killed in a fire while she was watching the dog, and the dad being forced to stick his arm into a lawnmower while the dog is present. The father barely avoids having his arm chopped off and soon, the dog begins to exhibit mental control that allows him to kill, injure, or control many victims. Eventually, the family's souls are possessed by the hound causing them to act strangly, including the son framing a student by stealing a watch and planting it in a classmate's locker, allowing him to win the student election. Dad decides the dog has overstayed his welcome when he finds a secret shrine to Satan in the attic. Dad tries to shoot the demonic beast to put an end to the hardships, but it is unharmed. Realizing the dog is is possessed, the father finally makes a special trip to Ecuador to determine how to destroy the animal. Unfortunately, there is no way to kill it, but if you hold a holy symbol to its eye, you can imprison it in Hell for 5,000 years. He takes it to a showdown at his work plant, but there the dog turns into a demon and begins to wreak havoc. When he is cornered by the monster, he holds the sign he made on his hand right up to the beast's eye. This causes the beast to be engulfed in fire and be imprisoned, getting his family's souls back. The final scene shows the family loading the family car for a vacation, and one of the children mentioning there were several more puppies the vendor was selling, suggesting there are more satanic dogs and that it is not over yet.

She moves in with her daughter Émilie and son in law Bruno who share a legal practice and have two grown up children: Anne, a law university student, and Lucien, who was adopted. In spite of Émilie’s efforts, Berthe is not happy in her daughter’s bourgeois home in Blagnac. She sits by the swimming pool in the middle of the night talking to herself and finds the house pretentious. Worried about her mother's physical and mental health, Émilie pays a visit to her unmarried younger brother, Antoine, a neurosurgeon. They have not seen each other for three years, since they quarreled at their father’s funeral. Émilie informs Antoine of their mother's condition and invites him to a Christmas dinner with the entire family. On Christmas Eve, Antoine arrives at his sister's home when Émilie, Bruno and their daughter are leaving for midnight mass. The neurotic Antoine has to remind himself not to be carried away and spoil the evening. As he wanders though the house looking for his mother, Antoine surprises his nephew Lucien, who works at a night club in town, making out with Khadija, Émilie and Bruno’s uninhibited Moroccan secretary who has been invited to spend Christmas with the family. Antoine promises not to tell anything. When he finds his mother's room, Berthe is delighted to see her son, but complains about living with her daughter. She dislikes Bruno, has no affection for the grandchildren and does not value her daughter’s efforts to make her feel at ease. Dinner is lively, but after the youngsters leave for Lucien’s room, tempers flares between Bruno and Antoine and they end up in a fist fight. Bruno becomes angry; Antoine leaves with a bleeding nose and Berthe departs with her son. Talking later with Bruno, Émilie loathes what they have become. Anne is distraught with the family's dispute and looks to Khadija for solace. Berthe returns to live alone at her farm but she suffers a stroke. This forces Émilie to visit her brother once again. Antoine has moved to a small apartment in Toulouse. He is glad to learn that Émilie has separated from Bruno. The siblings agree to place their mother in a nursing home as the only viable option.

Anne has now given up her law studies and works in a music shop. Lucien and Khadija have a rocky relationship. Antonie tries to rekindle the childhood closeness that he enjoyed with his sister. When Antoine and Émilie visit their mother at the retirement home, Berthe’s physical and mental health has visibly deteriorated. She wished she would have had a third child because that child would have taken care of her. Émilie and Antoine remove their mother from the nursing home. An exam at the hospital where Antoine works confirms their suspicion that Berthe is in her final decline. Émilie moves back to her house at Blagnac.

It is bankrupt, with no stars, no coach, no sponsors, no spectators and, most importantly, no owner. When the club falls behind on the lease payments for its home ground, the city council sends a notice ordering it to vacate the ground so that it can be demolished to make way for a commercial complex. South Asian football commentator Johnny Bakshi  serves as the frontman for the council, and although he pays lip-service to the contrary, very much looks forward to the demise of Southall United and the construction of the complex. The club has only one way to save itself, its home ground and its honour &ndash; win the Combined Counties Football League championship and its prize money of £3&nbsp;million, a very tall task indeed. Southall United captain Shaan Ali Khan  takes on the challenge of trying to save the club. First, he convinces a disesteemed ex-player, Tony Singh  to become the team's coach, despite its being branded the laughing stock of English football. Shaan and Tony set about rebuilding the tattered club, and the team works hard to prepare for its first match. Meanwhile, Sunny Bhasin ([[John Abraham  is an ace striker who wishes to one day play for the England national football team. However, his dreams are shattered when he is cut by Aston, an English football team consisting entirely of white players, on account of his skin colour.  Sunny has always disregarded his Indian background and considered Southall United to be a joke of a club, and initially rejects outright an offer from Tony to play for Southall United. However, after Sunny's humiliating rejection by Aston, Tony again approaches him. Telling Sunny he is sad but not shocked about what happened with Aston, he again offers him a place at Southall United. Sunny, though, again turns Tony down, boasting that no Southall player can tackle him and that he could score against them in 10 seconds flat. In response, Tony challenges Sunny to a ten-minute match in which Sunny must steal the ball from Tony; Tony defeats Sunny handily, proving that although he has been discredited, he has not lost his skills. Seeing that he still has much to learn, Sunny finally agrees to join Southall United. The other members of the club, especially Shaan, are not happy that Sunny has become their teammate, as on many previous occasions he had vandalized their homes and shops, but they eventually warm to him somewhat. With Sunny on board, Southall United begins its climb up the Combined Counties points standings. With success after success, the team is elated. To go along with his success with the club, Sunny has also managed to gain the affections of Rumana , Shaan's sister and the club's physical therapist, much to the captain's chagrin. Nonetheless, Southall keeps winning, worrying Johnny Bakshi and the Southall city council. Johnny devises a scheme to lure Sunny away from Southall United in order to deprive the team of its ace striker and, by extension, victories. He convinces Sunny to sign a lucrative contract to play for Millwall F.C. Shaan and the rest of the club are angered by his betrayal, and Rumana is heartbroken. However, Johnny's plan backfires when Sunny learns that his father, who had been staunchly against his son's football career, had been a Southall United supporter and had survived a beating at the hands of whites outside of a bar when Southall had last contended for the Combined Counties championship back in 1985. Moreover, the man who he had saved from that beating was none other than Tony Singh, the current coach of Southall United. Realizing his mistake, Sunny returns to Southall and resolves to stand up for his rights and that of South Asians all over the UK. The team ultimately claims the Combined Counties title, preventing the city council's plan to demolish its stadium.

Junon held her family together through many tough times, and although her willpower helped the family survive and prosper, it also has left many bad feelings among her children. Junon is still a handsome woman, and though her husband  has become obese and clearly aged, he retains a remarkable clarity, acceptance, tolerance, and unconditional love for his family, and it is clear that he and their love for each other is the lynchpin that holds an otherwise fragmented family together, albeit uneasily. The couple has three children, all grown and in their 30s. Their eldest daughter is Elizabeth, who is a successful playwright who is married to an equally successful man, Claude. They have one child, 16-year-old Paul, who is mentally ill and taking powerful medication to control his psychiatric problems. The couple's middle son is Henri, who drinks too much and has always fought and argued with other members of the family. He has a new girlfriend, Faunia. Ivan is the couple's youngest son. He is married to Sylvia, and they have two sons, Basile and Baptiste. Henri and Ivan are close friends with Simon, their cousin who was raised with them after the death of his parents. SImon works in Abel's small fabric dying plant, but is an avid and skilled painter in his spare time. He is also an alcoholic who has gotten in trouble many times for brawling in public. All three men dated or were interested in Sylvia at one time, but they manipulated her to think that only Ivan loved her; she married him and grew to love him. The Vuillard family's other son, Joseph, never appears alive in this film but is its core throughout, and the presence around which everyone's psyches revolve: he died of leukemia when he was six years old, despite a desperate effort to save his life by procreating another child who could be a bone marrow donor for him. It may be that part of the siblings' poor relationship is the resentment they feel toward one another for not saving Joseph's life. Six years prior to the Christmas gathering that is the heart of this film, Henri faced bankruptcy. Elizabeth paid off his debts, but demanded that he never see her again, meaning he was left out of family gatherings as well. Henri kept his promise. The specific reason  for this banishment remains unanswered to the very end, but there is much speculation on the part of the family members throughout the film about what precipitated it, including incest. Just before Christmas, Junon learns that she, too, has leukemia and does not have long to live, though she is offered the potential of a longer lifespan if she gets a bone marrow transplant. Her family gathers at the Vuillard home in Roubaix, a small city in the north of France. The family immediately falls to bickering. Junon asks her children if one of them  will donate bone marrow to her that will allow her to survive. Henri and Elizabeth cruelly fight with one another, and Henri begins drinking heavily and hides Paul's medication. Paul fears that the blood test he will have to undergo may also reveal that his father is not his biological parent. Henri initially refuses to have the blood test, because, he claims, he has never loved his mother. Faunia, who is Jewish, has agreed to spend some time with the Vuillards before leaving to spend the holiday with her own family. Her honesty and gentleness have a moderating impact on Henri, and she manages to spend two days with the family before finally leaving. On 23 December, Rosaimée visits the family for dinner and fireworks. Rosaimée was Abel's mother's friend, although it is suggested that perhaps the two women were lesbian lovers rather than ""just friends."" Rosaimée tells Syliva that Simon stopped seeing Sylvia because he believed that she would be happier if she fell in love with Ivan. This deeply upsets Sylvia, who feels betrayed and manipulated by Simon. Henri finally has the blood test without anyone's knowledge, and discovers he can be a donor. He decides to do so despite his coldness toward his mother. Simon disappears on Christmas Eve and begins drinking heavily in local cafes, and the entire family rushes out into the snow to find him. Sylvia discovers him in a distant cafe, and she confesses that she knows Simon loves her. She and Simon spend several hours talking, then return to the Vuillard home and have sex. Paul tries to tell Henri about his fears. Henri convinces him that he is not his father, a fact reinforced by the blood test, and reassures Paul that he is not a moral failure for being afraid. The man and boy begin to bond, and Paul begins to improve almost overnight. On Christmas Day, Abel and Elizabeth discuss Elizabeth's longstanding depression, and Abel reads to her from the prologue to Friedrich Nietzsche's On the Genealogy of Morality about how well we know – or don't know – ourselves. Abel suggests that Elizabeth fears death, and that has led to her caution and depression. The film ends with Ivan casually discovering that his wife has had sexual intercourse with Simon , but the effect on him is not revealed – he seems remarkably blase, almost as though he has expected that this would happen one day. Sylvia seems to love Simon just as he loves her, and it is suggested that the two have agreed to become lovers. Paul decides to stay behind with Henri, who is having a positive effect on his mental health. Henri donates his bone marrow to Junon, but she announces, seemingly before there would be medical evidence of this, that her body will reject the transplant. Elizabeth speculates that Junon will live, but Henri is shown flipping a coin in the hospital in front of his mother and not revealing the answer."

She is our 2nd mother. She teaches us what is right and wrong. Mi-ja, who has been taking care of a retired teacher, Ms Park, invites several of her former students to her house, 16 years after their graduation. Since the end of her teaching career, Park has been residing in the countryside, suffering from an illness while her ex-student, Mi-ja, cares for her. Se-ho, Eun-young, Sun-hee, Dal-bong, and Myung-ho each resent her for different reasons. Se-ho and Eun-young, who were the president and vice-president of their class, are planning on getting married. They remember the time they were belittled by their teacher for being poor. Sun-hee, skinny and beautiful, was made fun of by the teacher for being obese during her years in high school. Dal-bong, who had dreamed of becoming a baseball player, becomes handicapped due to severe corporal punishment. Myung-ho was sexually abused by his teacher. She also used to lock her deformed son {who wore a bunny mask} in the dark basement while the other children made fun of him. Myung-ho's mother, who filed a complaint, was dismissed as a psychopath. As the night of the reunion continues, the students start to die from the hands of a bunny-masked killer. See-ho is killed when the killer stuffs pieces of cutter into his mouth and applies hot water from the teapot. Eun-young is killed when her eyes are stappled, Dal-bong is killed when the killer stuffs black ants into his body and smashes his head with a baseball bat. During the movie, the bunny-masked killer is assumed to be her deformed son, coming back for revenge. As the plot thickens, Sun-hee tries to take revenge on Mrs. Park but fails when Mi-Ja appears and both have a short fight and ends when Mi-Ja throws Sun-hee down a cliff injuring her head and apparently cut in half by the big rocks, the masked killer turns out to be Jung-won, a shy boy who was humiliated in class because he defecated in his pants. The movie continues, and in a twist of events the detectives realize that Mi-Ja is actually the killer. They realize this when they go to Jung-won's house and see the skeleton of his mom. The detectives see pictures and news clippings on her wall. The police find out that Jung-won is actually Mi-Ja after looking through the feminine outfits in the closet. At the end of the movie Mi-Ja lures all her classmates to the reunion and poisons them all. Everything that had supposedly happened to her classmates, actually happened to her. Instead of living terrible lives, as Se-ho had said earlier, they all went off to lead successful and happy lives. In fact, they did visit Ms. Park every year as a class reunion, because they thought of her as a good teacher. At the end of the movie, Mi-Ja kills herself after confronting Ms. Park, who tried to save her but fails due to her health.

Roy's father dies suddenly under a tree. That tree is split in half by lightning, and Roy carves a baseball bat from it. He burns a lightning bolt on the barrel and calls it Wonderboy. In 1923, a 19-year old Hobbs  is granted a tryout by the Chicago Cubs as a pitcher. The train to Chicago makes a stop at a carnival and Roy is challenged to strike out ""The Whammer"" , the top hitter in the major leagues. He does so in front of many people, including a sportswriter named Max Mercy , who draws a picture of the event. Back on the train, the naive Hobbs is seduced by Harriet Byrd , an alluring woman, who gravitates to him after judging that he, rather than The Whammer, is now the best baseball player in the world. Byrd lures Hobbs to a hotel room, shoots him, and then jumps out the window to her death. It is later revealed that Byrd kills rising athletes, having already murdered two others. The story skips forward to 1939. The New York Knights have signed the now 35-year-old Hobbs to a contract, to the ire of the team's manager and co-owner, Pop Fisher . With the Knights mired in last-place, Pop is angry about being saddled with a ""middle-aged rookie"" and refuses to even let him participate in team practice. After a showdown in which Roy is told he is to be sent back to the minors, Pop relents. During the next game, the team's star player, ""Bump"" Bailey , angers Pop and Roy is sent to pinch hit. Pop encourages Hobbs to ""knock the cover off the ball"", which Hobbs literally does, providing the game-winning hit in a rain-shortened game. After Bump dies running through the outfield fence in pursuit of a fly ball in a subsequent game, Roy takes over as the team's starting right fielder and plays phenomenally, becoming the league's sensation and single-handedly turning the Knights' fortunes around. Hobbs' success prompts Mercy to try to unearth details about his background, but Hobbs is uncooperative. Mercy starts a rumor that Wonderboy is a loaded bat, but the allegation is disproven when the league weighs and measures the bat, which meets specifications. Roy is soon summoned to a meeting with the principal owner of the Knights, The Judge . Beforehand, Pop's assistant, Red , informs Roy that The Judge has an interest in the team losing, since Pop is obligated to sell his share to The Judge if the Knights fail to win the National League pennant. To ensure that result, The Judge had ordered his chief scout to stock the roster with unknown players like Hobbs. The Judge inquires about Roy's background but is rebuffed. The Judge then offers him a new contract as an implicit bribe to throw the season, but Hobbs makes it clear he is committed to winning the pennant. Gambler Gus Sands  and The Judge devise a plan to manipulate him: Memo Paris , Pop's niece, and Bump's former girlfriend, is sent to seduce Roy. Mercy sees Roy pitch to a teammate after practice one day and finally realizes where he had seen Hobbs before. He confronts Roy with the cartoon he drew after Roy struck out The Whammer and offers him $5,000 for his story, but Roy is not interested. At dinner, Mercy introduces Roy to Gus and Memo. Memo and Roy begin seeing each other regularly. Despite warnings from Pop that his niece is ""bad luck,"" he continues the relationship, and soon falls into a slump. At Wrigley Field in Chicago, Hobbs comes to bat in the top of the ninth with the Knights trailing by one run with a man on third. With two strikes, he sees a woman in white stand up in the crowd, illuminated by sunlight, and he promptly hits a game-winning home run that shatters the scoreboard clock. After the game, Roy realizes the woman in white is his childhood sweetheart, Iris , and they meet at a soda shop. She attends the next day's game, at which Hobbs hits four home runs. Later, they go for a walk and Roy confides his shooting and how he lost his way in life. Iris is sympathetic and they return to her apartment for tea. Roy notices a baseball glove, which Iris informs him belongs to her 16-year old son. Roy wonders where his father is and Iris says he lives in New York. Roy is curious to meet the boy but Iris tells him he should leave. With Hobbs hitting again, the Knights surge into first place, needing just one win in their final three games against the Philadelphia Phillies to clinch the pennant. Against Pop's advice, a victory party is held at Memo's, where Roy again refuses a payoff from Gus. Memo feeds Roy a poisoned éclair, causing him to fall ill. Roy awakens in a hospital bed a few days later and learns that the Knights lost their last three games, setting up a one-game playoff against the Pittsburgh Pirates for the pennant. The doctor informs Roy that his stomach lining has been deteriorating due to his gunshot injury, which was discovered when they recovered the silver bullet while pumping Roy's stomach. Hobbs is warned that his stomach could tear apart and kill him if he continues to play ball. Memo visits Roy in the hospital and encourages him to accept Gus' payoff. Roy later sneaks out of the hospital to take batting practice, but collapses after a few swings. Later that night, The Judge appears at Roy's bedside and increases his offer, even though he doesn't think Roy is in any condition to play. Hobbs refuses and The Judge threatens to ruin Roy's image by releasing photographs from the shooting, which were obtained from Mercy. The Judge also informs Roy that he has a contingency plan in place, having bribed another key player on the team. The day before the game, Iris visits Roy, who still blames himself for failing to achieve his full potential in baseball. Iris insists he's a great player anyway, but Roy responds that he could have been ""the best there ever was."" Roy asks whether her son is in New York with her and whether they will be attending the game. She says he is, but leaves before answering the second question. The day of the game, Hobbs goes to The Judge's office and returns The Judge's money. Memo fires a gun at the floor. Roy takes the gun from her and recognizes her similarity to Harriet Byrd. As Hobbs walks out, Gus predicts the Knights will lose. Hobbs heads to the locker room, where a nervous Pop is shaving. They converse briefly. Pop tells Roy he's the best player he's ever coached and the best hitter he ever saw, and tells him to suit up. Roy, injured and rusty, strikes out in his first at-bat. The Pirates take the lead when the Knights' starting pitcher, Fowler, surrenders a two-run homer. Realizing Fowler is the player The Judge bribed, Hobbs goes to the mound and tells him not to throw the game. Fowler replies he'll start pitching when Roy starts hitting. In his next at-bat, Hobbs strikes out again, falling to the ground. Iris, sitting in the stands with her son, goes down to the railing and asks an usher to deliver a message to Roy. The message says she and her son are at the game and Roy is the boy's father. Shocked, Roy peers out from the dugout but cannot see them. In the bottom of the ninth, the Knights are still trailing 2-0 and are down to their final out. After the next two batters reach base, Hobbs comes up and the Pirates bring in a young, hard-throwing, left-handed pitcher. Hobbs fouls the first pitch back, breaking the glass to the press box, where Mercy had been sketching a cartoon of Roy as a goat. Hobbs swings through the next pitch. Down to his last strike, he hits what looks like a home run down the right field line, but the ball hooks foul. At the plate, he sees that Wonderboy is broken. The batboy brings him his own handmade bat, the Savoy Special, which Roy had helped him make. The catcher notices blood on Hobbs' jersey, and calls for an inside fastball to exploit Roy's injury. With lightning flashing in the sky, Hobbs sends the ball into the lights above right field for the game- and pennant-winning home run. The lights explode and sparks rain down on the field as Hobbs rounds the bases. The screen fades to a wheat field bathed in sunlight, with Hobbs playing catch with his son as Iris watches."

The beautiful but evil Black Witch, queen of a neighbouring Dark Kingdom, is disgusted by their love and wishes to destroy it, and to this end she kidnaps Fantaghirò's father. The couple decide to hold off their wedding, and Romualdo leads their army to save Fantaghirò's father. On the journey to the Dark Kingdom, Romualdo and his men encounter Forest Elves and their Queen, who force them to submit to a series of tests to prove that their intentions are pure. Romualdo passes and the army continue on their way. They eventually reach the borders to the Dark Kingdom where they make camp for the night before attacking the castle. As they are resting, the Black Witch  arrives and seduces Romualdo to kiss her. Elsewhere, the real Fantaghirò has decided to secretly go to the Dark Kingdom on her own. She cuts off her hair and travels with her horse Golden Mane. Along the way she encounters bandits led by the Lemon Gobbler, but she manages to escape. She soon arrives at Romualdo's camp, which has been left abandoned. Fantaghirò enters the Dark Castle and learns that Romualdo's men have all been thrown in the dungeon. She negotiates with the Dark King to have a single duel between Fantaghirò and the Dark Kingdom's champion to decide the victor, with the losing kingdom submitting to the other. The Dark King agrees. Unknown to Fantaghirò, the Black Witch's kiss has erased Fantaghirò from Romualdo's mind and caused him to fall desperately in lustful love with the witch herself. Fantaghirò is horrified to discover that she has to fight her beloved, who does not recognise her. While the duel is going on, the Black Witch's minions Bolt and Lightning rebel against their mistress. Bolt poisons the Black Witch, and when she falls asleep, they release Romualdo's men from the dungeon. Cataldo and Ivaldo subdue Romualdo, stopping him before he kills Fantaghirò. Everyone quickly flees from the castle, taking the Dark King with them as hostage. Everyone manages to escape the Dark Kingdom except Romualdo, who runs back to the Dark Witch, and Fantaghirò, who goes after Romualdo. Fantaghirò and the evil witch then face-off, with Fantaghirò emerging victorious after a battle of wits, destroying her adversary. The Dark King is unmasked as being Fantaghirò's father, and now that the spell that had been placed on him is broken, the group return to their kingdom. However, Romualdo's memories have not returned to him. Fantaghirò, with the help of the White Witch, recreates the events of the previous film where they crossed paths for the first time. Romualdo starts to regain his memories but in doing so, it is revealed that a piece of the Black Witch has been hiding in his mind, and the witch appears and transforms Fantaghirò into a lowly creature off-screen. The White Witch comes to their rescue by using Lighting  to finish-off the Black Witch. Romualdo then guesses correctly that Fantaghirò has been turned into an ugly toad, and upon kissing her, the two are reunited again.

Shocked to learn that he is not invincible, Tarabas sends his clay soldiers out to kidnap all the royal children of the world. His mother, Xellesia, disapproves of this, but Tarabas is obsessed with learning how he will be defeated. Among the children he targets are the babies of Catherine and Caroline, Fantaghirò's sisters.

However, she is too late to save the King who, with his dying breath, asks Fantaghirò to take care of his daughter, Princess Esmeralda. Fantaghirò agrees, and takes Esmeralda away to safety. Tarabas, who has learned about Fantaghirò's quest, deliberately crosses paths with Fantaghirò and Esmeralda as they are travelling in the forest. He claims to be a common traveller, and they agree to camp together for the night for safety. Although Esmeralda is suspicious, Fantaghirò does not suspect anything. As they sleep, Tarabas is overcome with desire to kiss Fantaghirò, but as soon as he approaches her, he starts to transform into a hideous beast. Tarabas runs away from the camp, and as soon as he does, the transformation ceases and he returns to his human form.

They resurrect the Dark Witch and hold her heart hostage, promising to give her back her heart if she helps them find Tarabas.

Tarabas agrees to give Fantaghirò the Impossible Kiss if she will marry him. Fantaghirò agrees. Tarabas chains himself up to prevent himself from devouring Fantaghirò and they kiss. The magic of the Impossible Kiss is captured by the Black Witch, who promises to take it back to Romualdo. As Fantaghirò is preparing to marry Tarabas, she is told by Lighting and Bolt that the Dark Witch has broken her promise, and the power of the Impossible Kiss is waning. Tarabas agrees to let Fantaghirò go, if she will promise to return him. Fantaghirò promises and chases after the Black Witch, but it is too late. Although Romualdo cannot be revived, Fantaghirò keeps her promise and returns to Tarabas. But Tarabas has had a change of heart and lets Fantaghirò go, realising that this is the only way to prove his love for her. A second Impossible Kiss is made when Tarabas kisses Esmeralda, whom he has also grown to care for. This second kiss revives Romualdo, the pair are finally married and they adopt Esmeralda as their daughter."

Mercer travels to a bohemian pottery-making commune in Shelter Cove, California where Arlen once lived, but learns that he moved to Reno, Nevada. He passes through Fallon, Nevada to meet up with the seductive Joely , his middle school crush. In Reno, they take ecstasy and almost have sex before Mercer resumes his search for Arlen. Later he finds himself on the set of a pornographic film, where the director  tells him that Arlen left to work at a pet store in Sacramento, California. Joely asks Mercer if he can drive her cousin Buddy  and his friend Rid  to Mojave, California, where they are building their own car. While driving, Mercer finds Kate's YMCA card in the trunk of her car and, now knowing what she looks like, describes a dream to her in which he, Joely, and Kate are dancing in a re-enactment of Bande à part{{'}}s dance sequence.

They spend the night at a hotel, but he leaves without her the next morning and catches a train to Los Angeles, California. With the help of a translator, he phones Arlen's last residence and learns from a Hispanic woman that Arlen is working at a hotel in Ensenada, Mexico. Mercer finally meets Arlen  at the hotel in Ensenada, but Arlen assumes Mercer is just there for money. Enraged, Mercer tackles his brother to the ground and gets kicked off the premises. Kate later finds a bloody Mercer sitting on the side of a road and takes him to a hotel. She tells him that she let him take her car because she was attracted to him, and they have sex.

Janak Singh wants his daughter Karuna, also a lawyer, to marry Mohan. Mohan agrees out of gratitude to his patron and gets engaged to Karuna. Once, Chandramukhi dashes into Mohan and feels some strange connection with him. Mohan also meets an elderly singer named Saraswati Devi. She is shocked to see him but does not say anything. Whenever Chandramukhi meets Mohan, she acts atrangely. She has the nightmares of a man named Madhav, who is Mohan's doppelganger, plummeting to death from a cliff. Naresh senses that something is amiss and coerces Mohan to help him find the truth. On an excursion, Chandramukhi remembers everything: She was Paro in previous life and Madhav was her lover. A zamindar's son raped her and accidentally murdered her. Here, Naresh too realizes that he should step out of their life, as their romance soon gets rekindled. Here, with help of Chandramukhi, Mohan soon finds out that Saraswati Devi is Satto, the zamindar's daughter. Satto tells them that the villain is none other than Janak. Mohan is in a dilemma: he has broken off his engagement with Karuna for Chandramukhi and now he has to drag Janak to court. Rrealizing that he has no other option, Mohan decides to take matters to the court. Karuna, who doesn't have an idea of the truth, steps in to defend her father against this ""conspiracy"". Here, it is revealed that Janak is indeed guilty of death of both Paro and Madhav. He killed Madhav first, then raped Paro after telling her about Madhav's death. Paro had cursed him that just as he took away something precious to her, Mother Nature will take something important for him too. Meanwhile, Mohan seems to be losing the case, until he finds the mansion where Paro was purportedly murdered. He also traces Billi Ram, a senile old mason, who may hold a clue to Paro's disappearance. Billi Ram remembers that Janak had called him that day to patch up a wall in the mansion. Mohan comes to the mansion with police, who tear the wall down. A skeleton tumbles out in front of Karuna. Shocked by this revelation, Karuna goes to her home and sets it on fire. She sits inside, playing a piano and succumbs to the fire. After learning of his daughters death and the new discovery, Janak realizes that Paro's curse has done its work. Later, Janak pleads guilty his crime in the court and is sentenced accordingly. As he is escorted out, he and Chandramukhi see each other for a last time.

According to Pilger, his film ""...tells a universal story... analysing and revealing, through vivid testimony, the story of great power behind its venerable myths. It allows us to understand the true nature of the so-called ""war on terror"". Pilger believes the film’s message is that the greed and power of empire is not invincible and that people power is always the ""seed beneath the snow"". Pilger interviews several ex-CIA agents who purportedly took part in secret campaigns against democratic governments and who he claims are profiting from the war in Iraq. He investigates the School of the Americas in the U.S. state of Georgia, where General Pinochet’s torture squads were reportedly trained along with tyrants and death-squad leaders in Haiti, El Salvador, Brazil and Argentina. The film uses archive footage to support its claim that democracy has been wiped out in country after country in Latin America since the 1950s. Testimonies from those who fought for democracy in Chile and Bolivia are also heard. Segments filmed in Bolivia show that for the last five years huge popular movements have demanded that multinational companies be refused access to the country's natural reserves of gas, or to buy up the water supply. In Bolivia, Pilger interviews people who say that their country's resources, including their water and rainwater, were asset stripped by multinational interests. He describes how they threw out a foreign water consortium and reclaimed their water supply. The narrative leads to the landslide election of the country's first indigenous President. In Chile, Pilger talks to women who survived the pogroms of General Augusto Pinochet, in remembrance of colleagues who perished at the hands of the dictator. He walks with Sara de Witt through the grounds of the torture house in which she was tortured and survived. Pilger also investigates the ""model democracy"" that Chile has become and claims that there is a façade of prosperity and that Pinochet’s legacy is still alive. The film also tells the story of an American nun, Dianna Ortiz, who tells how she was tortured and gang raped in the late 1980s by a gang reportedly led by a fellow American clearly in league with the U.S.-backed regime, at a time when the Reagan administration was supplying the military regime with planes and guns. Ortiz asks whether the American people are aware of the role their country plays in subverting innocent nations under the guise of a ""war on terror"". Former CIA agent and Watergate scandal conspirator Howard Hunt, who describes how he and others overthrew the previously democratically elected government. Hunt describes how he organised ""a little harmless bombing"". Duane Clarridge, former head of CIA operations in South America is also interviewed. Pilger traveled through Venezuela with its president, Hugo Chavez, who he regards as the only leader of an oil-producing nation who has used its resources democratically for the education and health of its people. The Venezuelan segment of the film recounts events during the coup attempt of 2002, captured in archival footage. The film argues that the failed 2002 coup against Chavez was backed by rich and powerful interests under U.S. support and that Chavez was brought back to power by the Venezuelan people. Pilger describes the advances in Venezuela’s new social democracy, but he also questions Chavez on why there are still poor people in such an oil-rich country."

He is immediately set at odds with the locals: a businessman  who employs his authority in the community to disguise his personal weaknesses, his daughter  who uses the men in the community as rungs in her climb out of provincialism; a sour, manipulative club barman ; a widow and cocoa heiress  who plays puppet-master from a distance; hero of the bars  with his dubious investment schemes, sardonic gossip columnist Jane Audeby, and club waiter Elias who becomes his most candid counsellor. Deacon's big mistake is to write and publish a novel which draws on their weaknesses. The novel becomes a success back home, causing problems for its author. Before sunrise one morning a boat sets sail upriver. In it are First Secretary Hugo Shrike and Deacon, who has made a rendezvous somewhere on the banks with the person he has vowed to destroy.

Steele has just had his request for a transfer approved, and he and Eve look forward to leaving the island and getting married. However, their budding romance is quickly put on hold as the station's scientists learn they must deal with a rogue planet -- ""The Outsider"" -- that has entered the solar system, and which is on a collision course with Earth. The brilliant but cantankerous Professor Benson , living in an adjacent greenhouse with his dog Gideon, predicts that the Outsider will not strike the Earth but will simply make a close pass—a prediction that no other scientist will endorse. Meanwhile, a military base on Mars encounters the stray planet on its approach to Earth, and Commander Robert Cole and his wife Cathy quickly travel to the island outpost from Mars to help with the effort. The base scientists are elated when the Outsider passes the earth at a distance of 95,000 miles, just as Benson predicted. But Benson himself is stunned when the Outsider takes up an orbit round Earth. He concludes that the Outsider must be controlled by an alien intelligence, and he calls upon the world's scientific governing council to destroy it without delay. Against Benson's wishes, an expedition is launched to make a close study of the new planet. As the exploratory spacecraft approach, a number of disc-shaped alien spaceships emerge from beneath the planet's surface, destroying the Earth vessels. The phantom planet begins spiraling inward toward the Earth, creating hurricanes and storms, and the beginning of the end appears to be near. Professor Benson discovers that the alien ships are computer-controlled, and he devises a way to seize control of them from the Outsider. Benson is given the opportunity to join an expedition to the Outsider, to learn something of its underground base. Meanwhile, a plan is hatched to launch an all-out attack against the planet, in the hope that a massive nuclear strike will break the planet apart. Benson's expedition discovers a race of humanoid creatures dead at the controls of their planet-spaceship, as the automated systems continue their work without purpose. But the expedition has overrun its allotted time, and the order is given to begin the attack. It is a race against time as the members of the expedition try to get back to the ship before the nuclear warheads strike. Cathy is mortally wounded in the attempt to flee the Outsider. Benson refuses to leave, insisting that life without scientific knowledge is not worth living. The warheads reach their target, and the Outsider is successfully destroyed. As the exploratory ship returns to Earth, Commander Cole speaks Benson's epitaph: ""Poor Benson -- if they'd opened up his chest, they would only find a formula where his heart should have been""."

Their middle son is Kailash  married to a very devoted, loving woman. Their youngest son is Kamal , a college student, who falls in love with another student Usha Gupta . The young married daughter, who was living with her husband and father-in-law, has now moved back home using a trivial reason, such as how she doesn't like her father-in-law's singing. Her husband followed her and is staying in the household, trying his best to get his wife to come back to his home. Her mother has spoiled her completely. One day, the daughter plants a suspicion in her brother Kailash's head that his wife is having an affair with Kamal. Even after Kamal's marriage to Usha, Kailash's suspicions grow to the point where he leaves his wife and attempts suicide. His friend, a respectable dancer named Ragini, stops him. He accepts her help and later pursues her romantically, but she sees him only as a friend as he is a married man. One day, Kamal sees his mother about to hit his wife Usha and stops her. He also convinces his father to tame his mother and take control of the household, which he finally does. The father forces his daughter to leave with her husband back to her in-laws. When Kailash's wife tells him that she is pregnant, he rejects the notion that he is the father, claiming that Kamal fathered the child. The wife vehemently denies these allegations. Heartbroken, she attempts suicide but is stopped by members of the family. The sister is forced to tell the truth about how she fabricated the story about Kamal having an affair with his sister-in-law. Kailash now believes in his wife's fidelity and devotion and begs for her forgiveness. She forgives him, and the entire family is now reunited and happy.

His entrance is interrupted by a black cat named Butch, who slams the door into Tom causing him to look like a figure in Egyptian hieroglyphics. Jerry then comes out from the locker room, but Tom orders him to pick up his tennis equipment. Jerry hands Tom his racquet and a tennis ball, and a match between Tom and Butch begins. With no further need for the mouse, Tom dismisses Jerry by hitting him into the locker room wall and he ends up landing in the drinking fountain. Jerry's mad while standing in the fountain. Tom serves the ball and Butch returns it with such speed that it causes Tom's racket to burst into flame when it grazes the handle. Tom grabs another racket and serves three balls to Butch. Butch then splits his racket into three and returns all three balls back into Tom's mouth, and they settle into his tail.  Tom's next serve resembles a badminton serve and he pulls the net to force a drop shot. Butch then hits the ball hard into the ground and Tom has to stretch his arm all the way to the end of the court to make the return. Butch is then shown making many returns at the net, but the ball is actually bouncing off Tom's face. The ball eventually bounces back toward the end of Butch's court and Butch hits it with a lot of backspin, causing it to buzz in the air. Tom tries to chase after the ball, but ends up running into the post of the net and wrapping himself in the net. Jerry now gets in the fun by playing the cats against each other. He hands Tom a small white bomb which looks like a tennis ball so as to blow up Butch. Jerry winks at Tom and Tom winks back. Tom lights the bomb and serves it to Butch. Butch is about to return the bomb but it explodes just before he makes contact with it, making him look like a blackfaced ballet dancer. Jerry then removes a round, white piece of a gate that resembles a tennis ball. It is heavy enough to cause Butch to be pulled into the ground when he grabs it. Jerry winks at Butch, who winks back and swings the racket, allowing the force of the net to serve the heavy ball to Tom. The overconfident Tom gets hit in the head and breaks into pieces. Jerry starts to laugh at this and then he ducks out of the way as Tom is trying to hit him with tennis balls. Jerry ends up swallowing one of the tennis balls and he gets used as a rodent tennis ball between the two cats. After a small rally, Jerry lands up walking on the net like a tightrope and then wobbles onto Butch's head. Tom swings, hitting Butch instead and then throwing him onto the ground behind Tom. Butch is about to hit Tom but he sees Jerry running away on the other side of the court and he hits a tennis ball toward Jerry. Jerry grabs a tennis racquet and starts rallying with Butch. Tom gets involved in the rally when a ball gets stuck in his mouth, which Butch simply hits out of it. Butch runs through a chain link fence to return the next shot by Jerry, and Jerry has to move the sideline after a ball hits the net and drops over. Tom tries to get involved again, but Butch stops him. The rally continues and Butch runs back and forth on his side of the court with Tom next to him. Jerry then hits a really high ball and both cats run toward each other with an attempt to hit the ball, but they crash into each other and become a pair of conjoined cats. They separate and realize that they need to work together. They run toward Jerry and he runs toward an automatic tennis ball server, activating it at its highest speed. The huge force of the tennis balls hits the cats before they can dodge them, pushing them into the net, then through it all the way into a tree thousands of feet away, where they get tangled in the net, acting like marionettes. Jerry is then shown putting on a fancy jacket and he writes his name on a tennis trophy cup. He then stands and waves to a crowd of people and accepts his championship cup.

Tom raises his feet to let Mammy sweep under him, while Jerry is undisturbed as he comes out of his mouse hole and returns with a piece of cheese. As the mouse returns home, Mammy points him out to Tom, but the cat takes simply one glance before returning to sleep. The mailman rings the doorbell. She eagerly goes to answer the door, and receives a package. Mammy has been expecting this particular package, as she opens it to reveal Mechano, a talented robotic cat. Mammy calls Tom over to show him Mechano, using this as an official opportunity to downsize him after his laziness. In disbelief, both Tom and Jerry laugh out loud. To silence the cat, Mammy then turns on Mechano with the remote control, and it immediately darts to the mouse, hits him with a hammer, and slingshots him out through the window. Mammy then laughs, while, the sad, helpless and unwanted cat packs up and leaves the house. Mammy prides the ""new-fangled"" piece of machinery on its job and, as she flounces triumphantly out of the room. Jerry tries to get back into his hole in defiance, using various disguises to elude the computerized cat. First, the mouse sneaks through the mail slot with a letter for cover, but Mechano is still able to detect him. Jerry outruns him all the way to his hole, but Mechano hits him with a tennis racquet just in time. The machine hits Jerry again to bounce him into the air and then lobs him out through the window. Next, Jerry tries to sneak in through a garden hose, but Mechano chops the hose with an ax just in front of the mouse. Jerry tries to inconspicuously slip backwards through the hose and is cut off in that direction as well. Mechano continues to chop at the hose as Jerry turns around again, and Jerry is only left with a small section of hose such that he crawls like a worm. The mouse tries to crawl underneath the door slot and only does so in time to avoid getting chopped in half. To avoid being so conspicuous, Jerry slingshots himself from the front yard towards his mouse hole, but Mechano catches him with a baseball glove. The mechno-cat then loads Jerry into a cannon and uses the mouse's tail as a fuse, who is shot out of the window. Knowing he cannot win by himself, Jerry inserts a series of clockwork mice under the door slot to create a diversion army for Mechano. Everything quickly goes as planned: Mechano starts to attack the mice and the house as soon as it detects them. The machine chops up the piano with an axe, breaks the china with his cannon, saws a table with a buzzsaw, and launches dynamite into a mouse hole causing serious wreckage to the house. Mammy hears all of this, sees Mechano chopping into the floor after one of the mice, and yells at Mechano to stop. However, the computer will only respond to the controller, so nothing happens. Mammy runs around screaming for Tom's help and is quickly heard by him. Mammy runs away from the assault as Mechano tries to break through wardrobes and doors to chase the ""mice"" and ends up breaking himself to pieces. Mechano's computer hub, unfortunately, gets accidentally swallowed by Tom just before the maid reaches him. Mammy, with great relief, welcomes the cat back into the house, grateful to have him back on mouse-catching duties. However, Jerry gets the last laugh when he turns Mechano's remote control on, causing Tom to transform into Mechano! The terrified housemaid watches helplessly and starts screaming as the mechanixed Tom activates and goes on a path of destruction."

Once in L.A., the Chipmunks meet struggling songwriter David Seville ([[Jason Lee  who had his latest song rejected by JETT Records executive Ian Hawke , his old college roommate. Dave also once had a relationship with his next door neighbor, Claire Wilson . Dave also a former boss, Gail . After winding up at Dave's interview, the Chipmunks hop into his basket and follow him home. Once at home, Dave discovers the Chipmunks, and is accidentally knocked unconscious. Upon waking, he kicks them out until hearing them sing ""Only You"". Dave then makes a deal with them; they sing the songs he writes, and in exchange he provides food and shelter for them. However, all does not go well, as Dave's job presentation is ruined by their coloring on it, and when Alvin tries to set the mood for his dinner with Claire, things become weird and she rejects him after he tells her, ""My life is being sabotaged by talking chipmunks."" To make it up to Dave, the boys go to Ian in an attempt to record a song and get a record deal. Once the Chipmunks sing Dave's song to Ian, Ian signs them to the label and rehires Dave the next day. After a few singles, the Chipmunks become wildly popular. When Dave expresses concern for their well-being and insists that the Chipmunks are ""kids"" who don't need so much craziness in their lives, Ian convinces the Chipmunks that Dave is holding them back. After a misunderstanding with Dave, they go live with ""Uncle Ian"". They become enchanted with Ian at first, but once they set off on a coast-to-coast tour, Ian takes advantage of their naivete, changing their image and working them constantly. Meanwhile, Dave misses the chipmunks and he wishes they would come back home. He calls Ian to see if he can talk to them but Ian refuses, and then conceals Dave's motives from the boys. Later, the Chipmunks are wearing out, and it is all over the news. Dave, infuriated by what Ian has done to the three, decides to take matters into his own hands by infiltrating their concert. Just before the big concert, a doctor says that the Chipmunks are unable to sing due to exhaustion. Ian refuses to hand out refunds and advises the Chipmunks to lip sync. With Claire's help, Dave sneaks into the concert, but is grabbed by the security guards. When the Chipmunks see Dave being taken away, they realize that they've been tricked, decide that they have had enough of Ian, revealing that they were lip-syncing and ruin the concert. Ian catches them just when Dave is about to rescue them. He locks them up in a cage and prepares to take them to Paris. Dave tries to convince Ian to let the boys go but Ian refuses. Ian then leaves in his limo with the boys and Dave chases them but the boys have already escaped to Dave's car. Dave immediately pulls over and admits that he loves them like his own family. Meanwhile, Ian looks in the cage and is shocked to see the boys have replaced themselves with merchandising dolls. Sometime later, when the boys are fully accepted as part of the family, they invite Claire over for dinner again. Alvin accidentally creates a short circuit while having difficulty opening a bottle of champagne. Dave is trying not to say it, but the short circuit causes a blackout in the kitchen. Dave can hold it in no longer and says it, letting out his trademark yell ""ALLLLVINNN!!"", to which Alvin responds with ""Okay!"". In the film's epilogue, Ian  tries to make three squirrels sing, but fails."

To reduce the chance that he would be sent to Auschwitz or a similar fate, his parents send him to live with a farm family, the elderly parents of Catholic friends of his parents.  The elderly couple honestly think that the boy has been sent to live with them because Paris is dangerous; it never crosses their mind that Claude is a Jew. Claude is given a new last name , is taught a few things about Catholic ritual, such as the Lord's Prayer, and most important, is told to never let anyone see his circumcised penis ; thus Claude's strange prudishness at bath time. Otherwise, he plays well the part of boy grateful to be safe in the countryside, building a warm relationship with Pepe  and Meme , his simple and likeable surrogate grandparents. They form a strong and mutually affectionate bond. There is a fly in the ointment; Claude’s willing protectors share in the prejudices common to their time and place, anti-Semitism included. They believe World War II to be the fault of Jews, communists, Freemasons, and worst of all, the British who can never be trusted. Pepe even considers Marshal Philippe Pétain, the puppet ruling France under Germany’s thumb, a hero. Pepe attempts to pass his anti-Semitic convictions on to the boy. The boy plays along with the old man, teasing him about his prejudices but never revealing the truth about himself.

A giant, u-shaped magnet connected to the telescope is pointed at a comet and turned on, drawing the comet towards the observers. Something goes wrong, however, and the comet crashes into the town, rolls through the streets, and then tumbles into the ocean nearby. Newspapers the next day report the disaster, and the police are shown arguing with the scientist, who claims the importance of his work is worth the risk of human lives. The police say, as Lois looks on, that they will stop any attempt to try the experiment again, but the scientist refuses to quit, reminding them that any attempt to stop him could prove disastrous. He runs into his telescope room and shuts the door before the police can stop him, and begins his experiment again. Just as the magnet pulls the comet into earth's gravitational pull, the police jam a piece of metal into the electric generator running his machine and cut its main wires with axes.

In response, the hijackers deploy a bomb, which stops the fighters from taking off. Clark Kent goes into an elevator and changes into Superman as it goes up to the roof. Superman enters the plane to stop the hijackers, but one of them has Lois tied up and is ready to drop her out of the plane through the bomb hatch. Superman jumps out of the plane and comes back in through the bomb hatch to save Lois as she is being sent out anyway. He unties her and then starts fighting the hijackers. One of them breaks the plane's controls, and the plane starts falling towards the city. Superman takes Lois out of the plane and places her on the ground, then flies back up and catches the plane, bringing it to a safe landing right in the middle of the street."

The robot is controlled completely from the scientists command center, and we see that he is one of many robots similar to him, lined up along the walls of the lair. Next, we see the front page of the Daily Planet, reporting the ""mechanical monsters"" robbery right alongside an announcement for the display of 50&nbsp;million dollars of the world's rarest gems at the local museum.  Later, as Lois and Clark are covering the museum's exhibit for the Planet, a robot lands in the street outside. The police pelt it with machine gun fire as it marches towards the museum, but the bullets bounce harmlessly off. Museum visitors, including Clark and Lois, flee as the monster marches towards the jewels and begins loading them into an opening in its back. While Clark phones the Planet from the nearest phone booth, Lois climbs into the monster's back, just as the monster leaves the museum and takes off into the sky. Clark emerges from the booth, notices Lois gone, and says, ""This is a job for Superman!"" He goes back into the phone booth and changes his clothes, emerging in his classic red-and-blue costume. Flying high above the city, Superman spots the robot and uses his X-ray vision to see Lois inside with the jewels.  He lands on it and struggles to open the door in its back, only to have the scientist maneuver the robot upside down and throw him off into a power line, tangling him in the wires. As the robot is upside down, the door flies open and all the jewels fall out, with Lois surviving only by hanging for dear life until the robot flips back over. As Superman struggles to free himself from the wires, the robot arrives at the lair, but instead of jewels, the scientist finds Lois in its payload. Infuriated, he demands that she tell him where the jewels are. The next time we see her, she is bound and gagged on a platform held over a pot of boiling metal in part of what appears to be an industrial foundry. The scientist pulls a lever which starts some machinery gradually lowering her closer and closer to the liquid. Meanwhile, Superman frees himself from the power lines and knocks down the door to the scientist's lair, only to meet the army of robots . Under the scientist's control, the robots emit fire from nozzles positioned on the lower part of their heads, encircle Superman, and pound him with their fists. Initially, the robots seem to have the upper hand, beating Superman to the ground, but Superman defeats them, sending the scientist running. When Superman catches up with him, he is holding a knife to the rope holding Lois' platform above the molten metal, and threatens to cut it if he takes another step. Superman makes a move, the rope is cut, and Superman speeds across the room to catch Lois just in time, landing on a ledge below the pot of molten metal and the scientist. The scientist then pulls a lever to dump the hot liquid on them, but Superman shields Lois with his cape, then grabs the scientist and flies from the lair to take him and Lois back to the city. The film ends with a shot of the next issue of the Planet, describing the latest adventure -- Superman stopped the mechanical monsters, the scientist was arrested and the jewels are recovered. In the office, Clark says ""That's a wonderful story, Lois."" She replies, ""Thanks Clark, but I owe it all to Superman."" Clark smiles."

He spots the mouse and slides Jerry off the hammock and into the water; Jerry shortly wakes up after realising he cannot breathe. In retaliation the mouse flips the hammock over, so Tom falls to the ground and swallows his drink glass. After Jerry sits down to sleep, Tom shakes out the hammock such that Jerry is thrown into the air, but by pure fortune the mouse falls into a bird's nest. It stretches along with his weight and then throws the mouse onto the tree branches, through the truck and right back onto the hammock before Tom can lay down. When he hears Jerry snoring again, Tom spots him and is dumbfounded. In response, he scoops up the mouse and drops him on top of a marching ant army. Jerry wakes up at this jostling, but before he can understand what has happened, he bumps his head on a steel sprinkler. Knowing who is responsible for this, Jerry redirects the ants such that they march onto the hammock, causing the strings to snap and roll the hammock up with the cat inside. In the next scene, the broken strings are tied back together, and Tom keeps a lookout for Jerry while taking a refreshing drink. Meanwhile, Jerry walks onto a lily pad behind a bullfrog and kicks it into Tom's drink. Despite the splashing noise, Tom sees nothing extraordinary and drinks the drink - and the frog. The cat goes to sleep, but is awoken by the frog's croaking and leaping inside his body, who causes the cat several headaches as he lurches Tom all the way back to his home pond. Sopping wet, the feline recovers and sees Jerry, who is stealing his drink to boot. Tom bolts after the mouse, who flees in fright but soon sets a lawn mower after his opponent. Tom, fearing the loss of his fur, runs away in terror until he gets tied up into the hammock and sheared into paper dolls. Later, Tom goes to sleep with a baseball bat in the repaired hammock, but without disturbing the cat, Jerry hooks up the hammock to a rope connected to a well, cranks it as far as it goes, and then cuts the line. Tom is catapulted into the air, still asleep and still holding the bat in the same position, to the music of ""The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze"". Tom wakes up when he sees and hears an airplane, but it is not until a bird awakes him for a second time that he becomes suspicious and looks below, to see nothing but ocean below him! Tom panics, but can do nothing as he hits the ocean so hard he breaks into 16 pieces. Meanwhile, Jerry lures Spike onto the hammock with a bone, knowing what is about to happen: the cat is predictably irate and storms back faster than a speeding bullet to catch Jerry in the hammock. Without even looking, he wraps up the hammock and whacks it progressively harder each of seven times with the baseball bat. Tom reaches in and pulls out a dog collar, and pictures whose it could possibly be: Jerry? No! Not at all. Spike? YES! Tom is frightened and gulps, Spike is very mad. Tom puts his collar to him. The furious dog snaps his collar off and beats up the cat off-screen. Spike is now sleeping and kicking Tom, who is waving a leaf at a sleeping Jerry."

A train is being loaded with hundreds of bars of gold, guarded by several armed police officers.  Further ahead, in a passenger coach, Lois Lane boards with help from Clark Kent, who says he wishes he could come, but he has another story to cover. As the last of the gold is loaded, a car a few hundred yards away turns on its lights, and the men inside put on robbers' masks and arm themselves. The mysterious car follows the train. Later, a few of the robbers board the train from the back, climb to the middle, and separate several cars carrying guards from the front, leaving them stranded. Two other robbers attack the locomotive, throwing the engineer and a guard overboard, but falling off themselves as well. Lois, hearing the commotion, climbs to the engine's cab and is immediately machine-gunned from the robber's car, keeping pace with the train to the side. Lois grabs the machine gun and returns fire, only to have the bullets bounce harmlessly off of the armored car. The train continues to speed down the track, completely out of Lois' control and continually followed by the robbers. A stationmaster notices this when the train does not stop at the next station, and sends out a telegraph as signalmen change the warning lights to red, and for a railroad drawbridge to close. Finally, Clark hears the news report through the Planet's telegraph, and discreetly enters the building's storage room, changing into his Superman costume. He arrives on the scene just as the robbers have forced the train onto a track leading to a boxcar filled with explosives. Superman manages to rip the track from the ground and guide the train back to its main course. The robbers then demolish a bridge further ahead, causing the train to fall. Superman catches the train and places it back on the track. Finally, the robbers throw a bomb into the engine's boiler. Superman manages to pull Lois out just before the boiler explodes and both the locomotive and its tender car derail and crash to the ground. Superman catches the lead car as it begins to roll backwards, and pulls the train up the hill himself, only to have the robbers toss several cans of tear gas at him. Coughing, Superman momentarily loses control, but regains it, marching steadily up the hill despite the robbers' continued machine gun fire. Superman pulls the train at full speed over several miles before bringing it to a safe stop at the US Mint. The Daily Planet reports the successful delivery of the money and the capture of the robbers. Reading the article, Clark says, ""Uncanny how Superman turns up just when you need him."" Lois replies, ""I didn't even get a chance to thank him."" Clark smiles."

He remembers past years and how little he has accomplished in his writing. He realizes that although he has seen and experienced wonderful and astonishing things during his life, he had never made a record of the events. His status as a writer is undermined by his reluctance to actually write. He also quarrels with the woman with him, blaming her for his living decadently and forgetting his failure to write of what really matters to him: his experiences among poor and ""interesting"" people, rather than the smart Europeans with whom he has been with lately.

One day, she skips school to hitchhike to San Francisco, California to visit her father at a piano concert. When the guy giving her a drive attempts to undress her, she screams and leaves the car, running back home where her mother Victoria ([[Karen Young  expresses her concern over her absence. In response, she runs away home to a nearby carnaval, where she winds up dangling from a Ferris wheel. Her concerned mother decides that now something has to be done, and commits her daughter to a mental institution. Meanwhile, somewhere else Jake Walker , another 17-year-old teenager, has difficulty respecting authority as well, even though he was raised by two forward, highly successful parents, one of whom is a respected lawyer, David . When he is not sleeping around with girls, Jake spends his day running away from the cops because of misdemeanors. One night, after a concert, he is arrested by the police and the judge advises for Jake to be in a juvenile facility. Preventing these hard measures to be done, David commits his son to the same mental hospital for a period of one month. From the beginning, Zoe is pessimistic about her stay, feeling she does not belong in the institution. Nonetheless, she befriends Ally Winthrop , a teenager who suffers from anorexia nervosa and constantly gets caught messing with her charts. When she is caught once again, Jake takes the blame and immediately becomes Ally's limelight, unlike for Zoe, who thinks that Jake is a low-life punk and rejects every attempt of him to get to know her. During her stay, Zoe meets the other patients, including the gay son of a military Luke , an extremely aggressive young man with family issues Timothy 'Trader' , and a teenager who still has imaginary friends Sammy . During their stay, Zoe takes off her shield and grows closer to Jake. Ally notices this, and acts out by throwing up her dinner, for which Zoe apologizes. Nonetheless, Zoe and Jake soon kiss, but are caught by counselman George Beaumont , who reports the situation. Zoe and Jake are both informed that any emotional involvement with other patients is bad for their progress, and that they should not see each other any longer. They are put in other wards, but are able to meet without the guards noticing, with the help from their co-patients. Chief Barbico  opposes to the romance, though Dr. Sharon  feels that two people filled with hatred opening up to each other could help them recover. Dr. Sharon's theory seems to be confirmed when splitting them up becomes the cause for continuing outbursts, one of them including Jake trying to strangle his visiting father for having an affair. When Sharon arranges a meeting between the two, Barbico fires her on the spot and orders the teens to say goodbye. Instead of listening, Jake threatens Barbico with a knife, and is able to escape the institution with Zoe, Ally, Luke and Timothy. Whereas Ally is caught by the police, Zoe & Jake and Luke & Timothy split up after accidentally shooting a security guard who attempted to hold them. In a diner, Zoe and Jake find out that Timothy was arrested after returning to the scene of crime. Instead of following his steps, they steal a car and hit the road. A stop at her father  for help to escape to Mexico proves unsuccessful, as he turns her into the police. Zoe and Jake leave with her father's wallet before the cops arrive, but are almost killed on the road when Zoe drives dangerously upon noticing that Jake is flirting with another woman.

Deep under the docks, several large wires are connected to the bedrock. Following the wires away from the coast along the ocean floor, it is shown that they all converge in a strange underwater capsule. An elevator-like object emerges from the top and rises to an abandoned fishing house infested with rats. A man exits the elevator and heads toward the city in a motorboat.  Later, at the Daily Planet, a Native American man warns Lois Lane, Clark Kent, and Perry White that they must run a report of his demands; namely, that Manhattan belongs to his people and if the city does not give the island back, clearing it of its population, terrible things will happen. The Planet crew judges him to be crazy, and his threats to be empty... at least, everyone but Lois, who follows him to his motorboat. Hiding in the back, Lois is taken to the deserted fishing house on the water and sees his elevator. The man catches her watching him in the elevator's reflection, and calmly invites her to follow him, promising an amazing story. Lois follows. The elevator lowers into the underwater capsule, and the man offers her a seat, then pushes a button which pins her arms and legs to the chair. Stepping up to the controls, he starts up his earthquake machine, sending a powerful surge of electricity through one of the wires and into the bedrock under the city. The large explosion causes the entire city to shake, and runs a large crack through the Daily Planet building. Clark takes advantage of the commotion to change into his Superman costume. In one leap, Superman dives into the ocean and notices the several wires embedded in the rock. He pulls one of them out only to have it explode in his face, flinging him the ground and piling him with bedrock. He pushes the rock away and pulls at a few more, only to have the wires writhe with electric current and wind around him. At one point, Superman comes up for air only to have one of the wires wind around his neck and pull him down. Finally, Superman follows the wires to the underwater capsule and pulls them out from its base, causing explosions which destroy the machine. As water fills the capsule, the villain takes the elevator to the surface, leaving Lois trapped as the water in the capsule slowly rises. Superman spots the elevator and catches the villain at the top, but is told that Lois is trapped, and darts back down to save her. The villain, meanwhile, loads the elevator with dynamite and sends it down after him. Superman, however, saves Lois in time, and captures the villain as he is making a getaway in his motorboat.

18587578The story centers around two sisters , who are geisha, living in an okiya of their own in the licensed pleasure district of Gion, Kyoto. The two women have very different outlooks on relationships with men. Umekichi, the elder sister, is the ideal geisha; she grew up going to dance and music lessons, wears kimono, and has a strong sense of giri, or loyalty, to her patron. Umekichi’s younger sister, Omocha, was educated in public schools and wears western clothing, except when she is working as a geisha. Unlike Umekichi, Omocha doesn’t trust men and believes that they will only use geisha and then abandon them without a care. Thus, she uses men to her own advantage. In doing so she is willing to manipulate and lie to her customers. Umekichi’s patron in the movie is a newly bankrupt businessman named Shimbei Furusawa, who Umekichi takes care of after he loses his house and business. Omocha does not believe that her sister should support Shimbei, that doing so will prevent her from providing for herself by finding a new patron, and that she owes him nothing as, in her view, he has received more than he has given in the past. Omocha finds her sister a new patron and, one day when Umekichi is out, gives Shimbei some money to return to his wife in the country and tells him that her sister no longer wants him around. He takes the money but, rather than leaving, spends it drinking and takes up residence with his former clerk. Omocha also attempts to find a patron for herself and appears to be successful in gaining the attention of the owner of a kimono/cloth shop. However, in the process of helping her sister Omocha has previously taken advantage of the owner’s clerk, who has stolen from the shop to provide a kimono for Umekichi and been found out. Umekichi throws over her new patron when she learns of Omocha's deception of Shimbei from the kimono shop clerk, and returns to him. The clerk is discovered at Omocha's okiya by the shop owner and dismissed. He seeks his revenge on his former employer by informing his wife of her husband's infidelity, and then exacts his revenge on Omocha by abducting her in a car and injuring her grievously by throwing her from it. Omocha and Umekichi have conflicting outlooks on men and the role of geisha, but ultimately they are both defeated at the end of the film. Umekichi is abandoned by her bankrupt patron Shimbei when he is given the chance to manage a factory in the country where his wife has retired, and ends up caring for Omocha after her hospitalization for her injuries. Omocha curses the very existence of the geisha and the sexual subjugation involved. This tragic ending largely confirms Omocha's jaundiced view of the role of the geisha in a male dominated society, in a film that is surprisingly feminist for its time and place.

4152250The movie begins with introductions of the main antagonists as they are each arrested and charged as adults for their heinous and multiple crimes. The opening scene is a full-scale gang war led by two of the more notorious gang leaders in Miami. Ruben Pacheco , leader of the ""Home Boys"", and Moss Roosevelt , leader of the ""27th Ave Players"", are arrested for leading the riot. Next, Carlos Aragon  and his drug lord boss Nestor Quintana  are making plans for a large purchase of cocaine. He enters a car driven by his girlfriend Nikki , goes to the meeting point to make the buy, and is set up . Nikki, seeing an officer trying to come to the car, flees, and leaves Carlos in police custody as the scene fades out. Fourth is J.L. ""Crazy"" MacEwen . He sits on his bike on the side of a building, suddenly explosives he set up blow a large hole in the side of the school he attends. He seems remorseless as he calmly rides his bike home. He finds his sister sitting outside because his abusive alcoholic father is beating his mother. Sick of being under such abuse, he pulls a gun and points it at his father who dares him to shoot. He does so twice, without hesitation. He sits outside with his little sister, gun in hand, waiting for the police to come and arrest him. Lastly, a prisoner attempts to escape a medium security facility after striking one of the Correction Officers. His name is Dorcey Bridger , and is known for trying to escape every prison facility he's ever been in. After being arrested, they are all transported to Dade County Youth Hall to be sentenced as adults, and sent to Prison. Even in the confines of the center, they still show contempt for authority . The teens are all abruptly gathered and placed in a transport truck, and shipped to an unknown destination, fighting and trying to escape as they go. Nikki comes to the youth hall to see Carlos, and she is told that they have no file for him- even though she just saw him there the day before. As the 5 are transported they introduce themselves to each other somewhat and continue to show disdain and posturing towards one another. They find out that Crazy has Selective mutism from his abuse and will not speak, but communicates via howls and screams. The truck stops abruptly and they are put onto an air boat and taken deep into the Everglades where they are dumped in a remote area and left alone, seemingly to die. As tensions rise and old rivalries come to a head, Ruben and Moss try to kill one another. Suddenly a man in black named Joe ([[Stephen Lang  comes and forcibly separates the two. They begin to ask him questions and demand food and shelter from him to which he replies, ""Everything you need is over there"". He points to a set of bedrolls and survival gear before quickly disappearing into the woods. The group look through the packs and find survival gear they think is useless, except for knives. They sleep on the ground not knowing what to do. The next morning they awake to find Joe starting a fire with a Magnesium fire starter. He begins to explain the uses for some of the gear they have in the packs. As he pulls out a string of several fish from a nearby river, he begins to hear from Moss about how he's been in numerous youth programs and cannot be changed. The group further complains about the dangers of being in the swamp, the time they have to stay and the legality of having them there. Frustrated, he throws his knife into the ground and begins to explain to them that they were given to him instead of being sent to prison as a last-ditch effort at rehabilitation, and that if they don't succeed, they will die out here. He then tells them that where they stand is base camp. Even after the explanation and feeding them they still refuse to clear the area to make a shelter he replies, ""You guys slept good last night, fine by me"". A torrential rainstorm comes and drenches the group whilst Joe, who has built a simple shelter, remains dry. Moss sees an opportunity to get out by holding Joe hostage and forcing him to take him to Miami. He pulls a knife on Joe and is easily thrown and disarmed. As Joe teaches them more about how to survive in the swamp, it is revealed that he is a Miccosukee Native American. Tensions are still high between the five, even when they discuss something as small as a tattoo's meaning, it nearly turns into a fistfight. Joe tells them that if they want to fight each other, they must fight him first, defusing the situation. Joe leaves to gather supplies for the night and Moss notices that Crazy has finished his shelter. Trying to be the Alpha Male of the group, he forces J.L. to fix his shelter while he uses J.L.'s, telling the others that he will ""rent"" Crazy to them when he's done. That night, they eat their first meal from food gathered in the swamp, and the group enjoys the meal until they find out the ingredients: Milkweed, Wild Onion, Termite, Eggs, Snails, and a Frog. Ruben and Moss, being used to fast food, storm off disgusted but Crazy and Dorcey stay and eat with Carlos, who notes that if you were to eat the same thing at a restaurant in Coconut Grove, it would cost you ""At least a hundred with the wine"". Moss lays down in his new hut to suddenly be pulled into the air with a snare Crazy built into the shelter to teach him a lesson. In the night, Dorcey tries to escape thinking Joe is asleep, but Joe sees him leave and follows. Ruben awakes to see that Joe and Dorcey are missing. The scene cuts to Dorcey frantically running through the swamp not knowing where to go and Joe calmly tracking him. Dorcey stumbles and falls next to a Rattlesnake and is struck twice. Joe hears his screams and comes to his aid beheading the snake and giving him Antivenom. Joe returns to the camp where the remaining group ask if Dorcey will live as the group discuss the situation Dorcey begins to have a seizure he recovers and opens his eyes and the group is glad to see that he's alive. The movie cuts to a nightclub where we see Nikki looking for a group of men to take her to Nestor so she can find out if he can find and get Carlos out of jail. Nestor says he will try, but then he orders Nikki to go upstairs and undress. She does so grudgingly and looks around his room finding a brujería shrine. She undresses, crying, thinking this is the only way that she can get Carlos back. Carlos and the group, now learn that they must follow Joe's guidance to survive. Their once fashionable clothes become tattered and worn as the time in the swamp passes. They track down a boar and instead of trying to go their separate ways to capture it or go looking for easier prey they work together and catch it. Joe sees now that they are willing to work together to survive and during their boar feast he lays down a map and compass saying that this is ""Exam time"" that if they track him they will come out alive and he disappears into the swamp. That next day the group are in canoes trying to find their way out but are going in circles due to the fact that the person who has the map  can't read. As they successfully continue to track Joe, Ruben and Moss fight over the compass thinking that Carlos who has become de facto leader has them lost. They loose the compass in the water and try to kill each other. In the chaos Crazy, fed up with the posturing and rivalry, cries out for them to stop, speaking for the first time. The group, shocked that he spoke, listen to him as he tells them that if they don't work together they will die like Joe told them, and to find the compass they lost. They travel across a seemingly endless field of Sawgrass  working together looking out for one another and taking turns leading. That night as they camp a Black Bear enters the camp and they sleep in the trees to avoid being eaten. Later that day they find a Panther among the trees. Seeing that they are in true danger from the wilderness they pull even closer together. As the day ends they think that they are going to die and that the compass is broken they soon hear music coming from a nearby gathering of Miccosukee where they find Joe and begin to ask him if anyone else that went through the program ever saw a panther or been attacked by bears. He tells them that they are the first and informs them that they will be moving into a house in Miami to continue the program. The group comes to a dilapidated crack house near Little Havana and must learn to live in the city without going back to their old ways. Upon arrival they find various drug addicts in the building and a small number of Haitian refugees. They chase out the addicts and think about what they will do with the refugees. Enraged at the squalor they must live in they contemplate kicking everyone out of the building. Joe leads on that they should share the building with the refugees and learn to have compassion for others. Suddenly, a commotion drives them downstairs and they see a large group of addicts and prostitutes trying to retake the house. They easily kick out the crowd and have gained the respect of the refugees who now help them as they begin to rebuild the house. The addicts and whores have now gathered across the street and are berating the group as they remodel the house. A group of men dressed in expensive clothing driving a luxury car stop next to the crowd and chastises them for letting ""Five kids and Tonto"" run them out of the drug house, he then drives off. Ruben and Moss explain that the mans name is Cream  a local pimp and drug dealer that runs the area and that even the police won't touch him. Joe brushes off the incident and sends Dorcey off to get the utilities turned on he gives him $150 and tells him to sign his name on the documents . He asks Joe ""What's to keep me from taking off?"" Joe replies ""Nothing"" and Dorcey leaves and returns a short time later. That night Carlos leaves to find Nikki he goes to The Grove to find his best friend Aldo  to see if he knows where she is. He gives Carlos a new set of clothes and gives him the address where she might be staying. He finds Nikki in a large expensive apartment and asks her how she got it, She says that she's working for Nestor now and he storms off assuming that shes sleeping with him. In the lobby he is met by Nestor who takes Nikki by the hair and tells him he has nothing now in Miami and must leave. Meanwhile at the house, Ruben and Moss' gangs gather to see what their leaders want them to do now that they have come back. They find them painting the house and begin to ridicule them for doing bad work. Moss challenges one of them saying ""Think you can do better, Jackoff?"" the roles now reversed as the leaders watch as the two gangs are told to work together and paint the house. Carlos returns to the house and Joe confronts him at the door. He tells him one of the refugees is going to start a garden and without hesitation Carlos grabs a pickaxe and begins breaking ground trying to burn off the frustration after the confrontation with Nikki. The next day Joe is in a city office talking to a bureaucrat that seems too busy to care about his job. Joe asks him about funding to continue his program and the man replies that ""These programs look good on paper"" and that because his last program failed with two of the youths he once mentored trying to rob a 7-11 and various other programs doing illegal activity he will not receive a grant and if any of his kids do a even a misdemeanor they will be locked up for life. Back at the house the addicts try to kidnap one of the refugees returning from the store. The kids come to her aid and Carlos keeps them at bay with a shovel. Joe sees the commotion and pulls up screaming at them to stop. Carlos tells him they need to teach them some respect and Joe replies, ""There's another way!"". One of the addicts throws a beer bottle at Carlos cutting his head open. The group attacks in ""self defence"" and kicks the addicts out of the park. Joe laments at the act but knows there was no other choice. The next day Cream returns with more men he confronts the six as they play basketball and threatens Joe with a gun calling him ""Tonto"" once again. Joe disarms him and breaks his arm. He puts the gun to Cream's head and makes the group drop all their weapons. Joe tells the kids to gather the guns and kicks Cream out of the neighborhood with Cream saying "" You shoulda killed me Tonto, You shoulda killed me!"". That night Joe looks over his previous failed program and the kids that were killed in the attempted robbery, which ends with Joe burning a news clipping with their pictures. He overhears the teens in the other room making mock gun noises. Disgusted at them playing with the guns like children he scolds them, saying, ""You wanna use a gun you start with respect not your Barrio bullshit, you start poppin' off rounds the only one who gets hit is a kid in an upstairs window!"" He tells them about the failed program and his ""Band"" he lets them know that they are not continuing the program anymore but that he's not backing up anymore. he tells them that he's going to stand up to Cream when he returns for revenge saying ""You can't change the people without changing the streets"". He plans on taking the neighborhood back by force. The kids ask what will happen and he tells them that he will cover them in his parole reports for as long as he can. They refuse to leave, saying that they will stay and fight. The next morning he begins to train them in weapons and tactics saying, ""Each guy's life depends on all. On each man doing his job, you cover your zone. You know the man on your right will cover your right, you know the man on your left will kill everything on your left. You are all part of each other like fingers on a hand. A FIRE TEAM!"" The scene cuts to a yacht where Cream is speaking to Nestor about the troubles and that he needs to kill the kids. Cream's associate is looking at Nikki, who is sunbathing on the deck. Nestor stabs him in the hand telling Nikki to cover herself. Nikki is visibly upset. Carlos talks to Joe that night saying that he is not coming back, he has another war going on. Joe replies that it's ""The same war, you're just changing sides."" he arrives at Aldo's apartment and finds Nikki there. She has escaped from Nestor. After a verbal altercation about her sleeping with Nestor, they reconcile and plan to leave Miami for good. On the way out of town, Nikki tells Carlos that Cream is going to take out the house and all the kids. He quickly makes a u-turn and goes to help. Back at the house, Cream is assaulting the area while the kids fend them off the best they can. After a long battle Carlos returns and throws Nikki out of the car. He rams the vehicle that Cream is in, flipping it over. The remaining gang members flee as the kids regroup. They look at the house that is now in flames. Cream crawls out of the car and takes aim at Joe and the kids. Crazy sees him and warns Joe. Joe pushes the kids out of the way and fires. Cream and Joe kill each other as the kids look on. Carlos takes control and tells them to gather the guns and to get Joe's Jeep. That morning the five have Joe buried by his tribe in the everglades. They return to their home that is now in ruins and say farewell to one another. Later that week, they all return one by one to the house that is now covered in Nestor's brujería symbols as a warning not to resist him. They pick through Joe's items finding that Joe was a Special Forces Commando in the United States Marine Corps during Vietnam and he was the sole survivor of his own five man fire team ""The Band of The Hand"" and was awarded the Medal of Honor. Nikki tells them all that Nestor sent Cream and they come to the conclusion he was responsible for Joe's death and begin to plot their revenge. The scene cuts to Nestor who is planning to open the largest cocaine production facility in the United States, and wants everything to go smoothly for his financier, ""The Columbian"". He tells his bodyguard that he wants him to find Nikki and kill her as he sees fit. When asked about what to do with the other five he says, ""The kids, they're nothin', nobody."" The said kids are in a van following Nestor to a clinic where he is purchasing ether for the cocaine production. They continue to follow him and find a large compound in the swamp with a large amount of guar
s and dogs in a double enclosed electric fence. Crazy and Nikki pose as a boyfriend and girlfriend planning to do some gardening and purchase numerous chemicals and equipment to make pipe bombs and tear gas. After a strange conversation about armadillos with the clerk, they return to their new base of operations to prepare and plan the assault. Nikki, who is watching Nestor, sees the Columbian has arrived and informs the group. They all jump into Joe's jeep and head out. Night falls. As they begin the assault, Carlos gets onto a radio tower and watches over the other four with an Automatic rifle. Ruben, Moss, Dorcey and J.l. disable the electric fence and enter the secondary fence. As the guard dogs approach, they use a female dog in heat to lure them away and breach the second fence as Nikki guards the perimeter. Nestor shows the Columbian the facility and its enclosed air conditioning system and that it is undetectable due to being able to scrub the ether out of the air before expelling it. Crazy uses this to his advantage and uses ""Gopher gas"" to force out the occupants by flooding the room with gas. A guard notices him and shoots at J.L. but Carlos kills him before he can take careful aim. The whole compound, now on alert, searches the area for the intruders as they try to place explosives in the compound to blow up the stockpile of ether. Moss, Ruben and Dorcey storm the entrance but are stopped short by an M-134 Minigun in a tower. As they are pinned down Carlos is able to take out the operator but another quickly takes his place. Crazy, being the only on near enough and out of range, climbs onto the roof and throws a pipe bomb into the tower destroying the minigun. The kids are able to breach the compound and arm their explosives, making it out alive. Nestor who has managed to escape finds Nikki with a shotgun and drops his weapon. He tries to convince her to give him the gun and grabs the barrel. Nikki shoots him in the abdomen killing him. The group gathers at the gate and detonate the explosives, leveling the building and killing the remaining guards. Driving away they reminisce about Joe wanting this and are stopped at a Police checkpoint. An officer asks where they are going and they reply ""Miami, We're gonna jam!"" the officer thinking they are just a bunch of innocent teens lets them go unopposed.

Jerry removes the tack with a hammer after hearing the dog's pained cries, and as a reward, Spike becomes Jerry's protector, providing him with a bell to ring whenever he is in trouble. Jerry walks away, carefree and pleased with his good deed. Tom sees a good opportunity to catch his unaware rival and hides until Jerry walks around the corner, catching the mouse by surprise. After snatching up Jerry, Tom becomes curious as to what the bell could be for and rings it. Spike drops right on top of him and throws him onto the concrete twice, then picks him up onto his back and prepares one last move, spins around and slams the cat to the concrete, who breaks apart and reforms in the space of a second. Spike returns the bell to Jerry and skips away, but not without being seen by Tom. Making the connection, the cat tries an alternative by covering the mouse with a flowerpot such that he cannot ring the bell; unfortunately for Tom, there is a hole in the bottom, which the mouse sticks the ringing bell out of. Spike's fist extends itself from clear across the block and knocks Tom into a gumball machine, which then falls back onto the cat such that gumballs roll out of his head. Eventually, under pain of canine catastrophe, Tom is forced to become Jerry's ""slave"" around the house. Tom sets out five trays of cheese for Jerry, and while the mouse sniffs one, Tom attempts to filch the bell. Jerry thwarts him and eats a big wedge of cheese, causing himself to expand to the size of the wedge. Meanwhile, Tom reads the daily paper and is delighted to notice this headline: LEASH LAW PASSED: Public safety puts dogs on leash. Pleased with his freedom from both mouse and dog, Tom jaunts outside with the paper and 'tsk's at the dog while pulling at his leash. Tom measures the leash's length, draws a line in the grass, and slaps the dog with the paper. Spike attempts to bite at Tom repeatedly, but the leash barely restrains the dog. Tom pies Spike, smashes his head between cymbals, and punches him with a boxing glove, and then lets the dog's chomping teeth turn a log into a baseball bat. At his leisure, Tom knocks the dog out with it and then uses it as a pool cue to shoot Spike back into his doghouse. Tom returns, ecstatic, to Jerry and bops him on the head, and when the mouse rings his bell, no response is heard. Tom slaps him again and offers the mouse four other bells as further embarrassment. When these fail to work, Jerry realizes the truth and flees with his small bell. Tom corners him and beats him silly to the point that Jerry swallows the bell. Jerry runs to Spike's doghouse and rings himself, pleading for help. Spike, with sad eyes, presents his leash. Tom takes a break from chasing Jerry to tantalize Spike again, and holds out a lead pipe as Spike angrily tries to bite the cat again. All the dog's teeth fall out, and Tom nonchalantly sweeps them back up and returns them. Picking up on the pattern, Spike angrily rubs out the line, draws a new one in a spot he can reach and plops back down innocently. Tom chases Jerry both ways and stops to torment Spike again, but Spike lands directly on the cat this time. Realizing he's been tricked, the feline leaps out of his skin! Before Spike can process this information, Tom steals his skin back and escapes into a croquet field. Jerry runs through the field until he sees Tom, but cannot avoid being pelted by Tom's mallet. As Jerry hits the starting post, the bell is expelled from his stomach; Tom catches both the mouse and the bell and continuously rings the bell as the cartoon fades to a new scene. Tom has now pressed Jerry into servitude, using the bell as his signal. Jerry brings Tom's tray of food to him and falls under its weight. While Tom gobbles a turkey leg, Jerry reads the paper which shows the leash law's reversal: LEASH LAW LIFTED: Happy hounds hail freedom. Ecstatic, Jerry hits Tom with the newspaper, causing Tom's turkey to be lodged in his throat. Before the cat can capture him, Jerry rings his bell, and nothing happens for the moment. Tom, still believing the dog to be tied up based on Spike's non-appearance, rings the bell and bops Jerry alternately. Spike, carrying a newspaper himself, sneaks behind Tom and slams him over the head. Clueless, Tom rings the bell and is slapped again. Tom then rings a third time and ducks the newspaper swing, then peeks behind him and briefly sees Spike; the dog hits the cat a third time, cordially returns the bell to Jerry and then engages Tom in a brutal fight. After the brawl, Jerry and Spike are strolling down the street, with Tom inside a dog's leash and collar. Spike kicks Tom whenever Jerry rings his bell."

Monokoa, a volcano which has been dormant for about 300 years. The last time it erupted, it destroyed a nearby island city completely and sent tidal waves around the world. Now, the volcano is showing signs of eruption, threatening the small town  yet again. Lois Lane and Clark Kent are sent to the scene by Perry White, who gives each of them steam tickets to the island, as well as press passes, ordering Lois to keep them safe as she stows them in her purse. On arrival, Clark can't find his press pass , and goes back into town to retrieve it as Lois takes a tour of the volcano. Her guide tells her that the plan to save the city is to blow a hole in the side of the volcano, thus altering the course of the lava flow from the town, to the ocean on the other side of the island. Suddenly, the volcano begins to erupt, and lava spews out of its top, flowing towards the town. Lois and her guide are separated. Two men on the other side of the volcano scramble to get to the machinery which will blow a hole in its side, but a giant boulder cuts the wire connecting the dynamite to the machine, rendering it useless. From the town below, Clark sees the volcano let out a particularly explosive blast and says, ""This looks like a job for Superman."" He changes into his costume and flies up to the volcano, catching a huge boulder hurtling toward the town and flinging it into the ocean. This momentarily leaves him stunned on a ledge on the mountainside as the lava creeps nearer and nearer to the town and Lois is struggling to get away from the volcano by edging hand over hand along a cable wire connecting two mountains. She makes it to a cable car just as the cable begins to give way. Superman saves her, then flies back, catches the cable car and flings it at a mountain near the advancing lava, causing a landslide which dams up the lava flow to the town. Then Superman flies to the dynamite machinery and notices the cut wire. He pulls the two wires together to complete the connection, and in a huge blast the side of the volcano explodes, and the remaining lava slides harmlessly into the ocean. In the final scene, Lois and Clark are on the boat home, and Clark commends Lois for her excellent story. Lois remarks that its too bad he wasn't there as well, whereupon Clark pulls the second press pass sticking out of her open purse and says, ""I would've been, if I hadn't lost my pass."""

He spots French troops and sends a Dutch cavalryman on patrol to alert the Allied command. However, the cavalryman and his patrol are attacked and killed by French cuirassiers . Sharpe then returns to the Prince of Orange's camp. There, he is reunited with his former sergeant major and best friend, Patrick Harper , and two of his long-time ""chosen men"", Hagman  and Harris . Sharpe finds employment as a lieutenant colonel on the staff of Prince William of Orange  and makes the acquaintance of his aide de camp Colonel Rebecque . Sharpe scouts the French forces, while a contingent of Dutch musketeers holds a French column off. He then alerts Lord Wellington ([[Hugh Fraser  at a ball in Brussels that Napoleon is on the move. As Sharpe is leaving, he runs into his wife and her lover, Lord Rossendale ; he chases Rossendale and causes a scene in front of the guests. He extracts a promise that he will get back the money Jane stole from him. Previously, Jane had persuaded Rossendale that he must kill her husband during the coming battle. Sharpe is sent to command the defence of a crucial farmhouse at La Haye Sainte, which is manned by the King's German Legion and the 95th Rifles. He saves a King's German Legion officer, Macduff. Believing that La Haye Sainte has fallen, Prince William orders an English regiment to form line and re-capture the farm. However, French cavalry are nearby and, with the British in exactly the wrong formation, destroy the unit and capture its colours, while Sharpe watches in disgust. Sharpe witnesses more instances of the absolute military incompetence of Prince William. The last time, it costs the lives of Harris and Hagman. Furious, Sharpe shoots the prince at long range from a secluded spot, but only succeeds in wounding him.  Meanwhile, on another part of the battlefield, Rossendale is killed fighting French cuirassiers. Sharpe then rejoins his old unit, the Prince of Wales' Own Volunteers, taking over when its commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Ford, becomes a casualty. At the crucial point of the Battle of Waterloo, Napoleon sends in his elite Imperial Guard. Sharpe repels the last-ditch assault, much to Wellington's delight. Wellington gives Sharpe command of the regiment and tells him to pursue the retreating enemy. Whilst advancing, Sharpe glimpses Napoleon as he rides off in defeat."

Tom gets his revenge on Jerry by offering him a chance to dance. He pummels and wallops Jerry around the stage and hurls him into a tuba, where he is ""squirted"" by the blowing of one of the orchestra members into the instrument. The attempts of both cat and mouse to get one up on each other continues, with Tom using his baton as a snooker cue to pot Jerry off the podium. When Jerry pleads and begs Tom to let him conduct the orchestra, Tom uses Jerry's baton as a toothpick and throws it away. Jerry retaliates by snapping Tom's baton in half and then throwing that away, only for Tom to produce a spare baton from his pocket. He sticks his tongue at Jerry and continues to conduct. Jerry, fed up, hammers some wheels onto the podium and pushes the podium  out of the amphitheatre. Tom, unaware of what is going on, continues to conduct, as the podium travels out of town and into the road, where he is promptly flattened by a passing bus. By now, Tom is furious. He returns, with his suit ripped and his eyes blackened, and grabs Jerry by the coat-tails, and dangles him between two cymbals, which are bashed together, flattening Jerry. A flat and almost transparent Jerry floats down to the floor and pops back to his full size and structure. Enraged and deciding to sabotage the concert, Jerry grabs a saw and starts sawing underneath the floor of the orchestra, causing the feline members of the orchestra to suddenly disappear under the floor. Jerry disposes of the orchestra members, one by one, until only Tom is left to play all of the instruments while Jerry conducts and the concert ends. And of course, Jerry takes all applause and credit for himself, then he points to the ""One-Man Orchestra"" Tom, who is now very tired. Then Tom stands up, bows down ,and then falls down like rest of the feline orchestra."

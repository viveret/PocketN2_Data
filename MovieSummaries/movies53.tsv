Every day, Ree makes sure her siblings eat, while teaching them basic survival skills like hunting and cooking. The family is very poor. Ree's father, Jessup, has not been home for a long time and his whereabouts are unknown. He is out on bail following an arrest for manufacturing methamphetamine. The sheriff tells Ree that if her father does not show up for his court date, they will lose the house because it was put up as part of his bond. Ree sets out to find her father, following his trail into a world where meth use is common, violence is frequent, women are scared of their men, and people are bound by codes of loyalty and secrecy. She starts with her meth-addicted uncle Teardrop  and continues on to more distant kin, eventually trying to talk to the local crime boss, Thump Milton. Milton refuses to see her; the only information Ree comes up with are warnings to leave the situation alone and stories that Jessup died in a meth lab fire or skipped town to avoid the trial. When Jessup fails to appear for the trial, the bondsman comes looking for him and tells Ree that she will have about a week before the house and land are seized. Ree tells him that Jessup must be dead, because ""Dollys don't run."" He tells her that she will need to provide proof that her father is dead in order to avoid the bond's being forfeited. Ree tries to go to see Milton again and is severely beaten by his women. Teardrop shows up and rescues Ree, promising her attackers that she will not say anything or cause any more trouble. Teardrop tells Ree that her father was killed because he was going to inform on other meth cookers, but he does not know who killed him; he warns her that if she ever finds out who did that she must not tell him because it could get him killed. A few nights later, the same three Milton women who beat Ree come to her house. They offer to take her to see ""her daddy's bones"". The women place a burlap sack on her head and drive her to a pond, where they get into a rowboat and row to the shallow place where her father's submerged body lies. They tell Ree to reach into the freezing water and grasp her father's hands so they can cut them off with a chainsaw; the severed, decaying arms will serve as proof of death for the authorities. Ree takes the hands to the sheriff, telling him that someone flung them onto the porch of her house. The bondsman comes back to the house and gives Ree the cash portion of the bond, which was put up by an anonymous associate of Jessup. Ree tries to give Jessup's banjo to Teardrop, but he tells her to keep it at the house for him. As he is leaving, he tells her that he now knows who killed her father. Ree reassures Sonny and Ashlee that she will not ever leave them, regardless of the money she just received. As the film closes, Ashlee retrieves Jessup's banjo and begins to play."

While away, their twelve-year-old daughter Angela, who is disabled and walks with crutches, has to remain home under the care of her governess, Traunitz. Actually, the couple have lied about their travel intentions. Convinced that his wife and daughter are elsewhere, Gerhard takes his longtime French hairdresser mistress Irene Cartis on a weekend tryst to the family's country house. The Christ’s family rural estate is run by a sinister housekeeper named Kast and her sexually ambiguous son, Gabriel. While Kast, a cruel and cranky old woman, is irritated by the visit of her employers, her son Gabriel, a pretentious aspiring writer, is hoping to exploit Gerhard's connections to get his work published. Upon entering the house with his lover Irene, Gerhard runs to the living room, only to find, Ariane on the floor with her lover, Kolbe, Gerhard’s assistant. The two couples try to overcome the uncomfortable situation and are able to laugh about the absurdity of it. They all have dinner together and, over coffee, Gabriel is allowed to read from the philosophical book he has written. He is interrupted by the arrival of Angela, who secretly planned this encounter out of hate for her parents lack of affection. She shows up with her mute governess, Traunitz and a small army of grotesque dolls. Ariane is furious with the antics of her daughter and tries to hit her but Gerhard does not allow her. Angela is defiant and on their part the two adulterous couples decide to continue as planned. Angela tells Gabriel that her disability originated with her parents infidelities. Eleven years ago, when her father started her relationship with his mistress, Angela’s illness appeared. When her mother begun an affair with Kolbe, the doctors declared Angela’s condition as hopeless. However Kast, later dismissed the child’s allegation as nonsense. The next morning Angela goes from room to room to say good morning to her parents and finds them naked with their respective lovers. During the day as the adulterous Christs come to terms with their respective infidelities, Angela tries to play them and their lovers off each other. The stage is laid for a night of suspenseful revelation when Angela, on the second night, suggests playing Chinese Roulette, a psychologically guessing game, tinged with cruelty. In Chinese Roulette, one team tries to guess which of them the other team is thinking of by asking questions. Angela selects the members of each team. In one side are: Gerhardt, Angela, Gabriel and Traunitz. On the other are: Ariane, Katz, Irene and Kolbe. Arianes’s team asks the questions and Angela’s team gives the answers. The game has an edge of cruelty and the results are explosive involving everyone in the chateau. The deadliest and final question posed is ""What would this person be in the Third Reich?"" Caught off guard by the hostility of Angela's response of saying she would be a commandant of a concentration camp, the mother shoots Traunitz—which turns out to be only a superficial flesh wound. Irritated by Gabriel, Angela tells him that for the last two years she has known that he has plagiarized every word he has written. The film ends in mystery as a second shot is heard in the darkened house, but the identity of the shooter and the victim is left to the viewer's imagination."

After being publicly humiliated by the townspeople, he and his friend 'Pistol' Porter confiscate gambling equipment and set out to Silver City, Nevada to open a saloon and gambling hall. On his way to St. Joseph, Mike meets Georgia Moore, a beautiful but serious woman that runs the Silver River mine with her husband Stanley and is currently hiring all the available wagons. McComb wins ownership of the wagons in a poker game, much to Georgia's anger. Although he allows her to travel with him, she is unamused with McComb's playful behavior and soon abandons him. Once in Silver City, McComb, in a short time, builds the most successful saloon of the area. He hires John Plato Beck as his lawyer, an alcoholic but good-hearted man. Meanwhile, Georgia is worried when she finds out Stanley has bought back his wagons from McComb in exchange for 6,000 shares in the mine. This is only worsened when it turns out that Stanley does not have the money to finish his smelter and has to go to McComb for finances. Mike agrees to finance him, in exchange for a third interest in the mine. Furthermore, McComb announces to open a town bank, in which the townspeople can accept to pay vouchers in lieu of cash. Despite having become one of the most rich and successful men in area, his bank empire even receiving a visit from the President of the United States, Ulysses S. Grant, McComb is unable to charm Georgia. Encouraged by the President, McComb plans on extending his empire up to and including Black Rock Range. Although he is aware of the dangerous Shoshone Indians in that area, he assigns Stanley to realize his plans. When Plato makes him feel guilty, McComb warns Georgia about the danger her husband is in, but it turns out that they are too late: Stanley has been killed by the Indians. After the funeral, Georgia shortly visits San Francisco and is romanced by McComb upon her return. During a formal dinner party, Plato throws a tantrum while drunk and breaks up the party with accusations against McComb. The townspeople start to lose their faith in McComb and withdraw their money from his bank. To worsen matters, the other owners try to corner the silver market. Georgia begs McComb to reopen the mines, and when he refuses, she leaves him. Soon after, McComb is forced to file bankruptcy. Meanwhile, Plato runs for the United States Senate and in front of a crowd is killed by his competition Sweeney. McComb convinces the towsnpeople to avenge Plato's death. However, when Sweeney is about to be killed by the mob, McComb stops them and convinces them to allow Sweeney to stand trial. He promises to make Silver City a better place, and Georgia, impressed with McComb's new attitude, reunites with him.

Bartlett three years ago. Nowadays, she regrets this decision and attempts to win back his affection. Lincoln, however, is engaged to Agnes Oglethorpe Young, the beautiful young daughter of his mentor Dr. Carleton Radwin Young. Nevertheless, Ina is determined to reconcile with Lincoln and grabs every chance on seducing him. Lincoln remains loyal to his fiancée, though, and soon grows irritated by Ina's attempts to impress him. On night of the premiere of her latest opera La Bohème, Ina is bothered with a sore throat and calls Dr. Young. Lincoln, who is replacing Dr. Young that night, suspects that Ina is faking. However, when he examines her, he diagnoses a tropic disease she had possibly got in South America. Ina ignores his diagnose and performs that night without any problems. The next morning, however, she is suddenly unable to speak. She goes to see Dr. Young, who diagnoses functional euphonia, a speaking disorder caused by shocking news. Young advises psychiatric help and tells Lincoln that a new love interest for Ina could solve the problem. Ina is assigned as Lincoln's client, much to Agnes' annoyance. Although Lincoln assures Agnes several times he has no feelings for his ex-wife, she remains suspicious of his connection with Ina. Lincoln contacts his friend Chris Bartlett, hoping he will be able to romance Ina. He sets up a date between the two, but Ina shows no interest in Chris, only able to think of Lincoln. Later that night, Ina is able to break through Lincoln's wall, convincing him to spend the night with her. They enjoy a dinner at a restaurant where they are spotted by some of Agnes' friends. On their way back home, Ina again attempts to seduce him. Although Lincoln does not reply to her, he seems to have softened up. That night, Lincoln is bothered with a nightmare in which Ina is killed. When he wakes up, he realizes he still loves his ex-wife. He goes to the room where she is staying to hug her, when Agnes and Chris suddenly come in. Agnes, feeling betrayed, breaks off the engagement, despite Lincoln's attempts to explain the situation. Ina, who had got back her voice when Lincoln softened up, announces she is fed up with the love triangle as well and storms out. She soon returns, however, and is told by Chris that Lincoln is bothered with functional euphonia too. He regains his voice to tell Ina he loves her and, in the end, they kiss.

She seems on edge, and frantically scribbles images of eyes and a possessed looking child, all of which are taped to her cell walls. Her husband, Joe Alves  comes to visit her. She asks about her daughter Pia, and Joe says that all she wants is for her mom to come home. As the conversation continues, Susan grows more and more nervous and keeps looking behind her at a mirror on the wall. She begins to panic and says she can't bear it any longer, and that ""We need to stop him"". She breaks the mirror and slits her throat in front of her husband. The film cuts to Mumbai during a scene from horror film director Vic's  most recent project. At the launch party, his wife, Pia  seems suspicious of Vic's interactions with the lead actress. At home, it is obvious that their marriage is strained. While Vic is having a drink, Pia vomits. The next morning, Vic gets a call from Pia's friend Carol  in Mauritius saying that Pia's father Joe Alves has suffered a heart attack. While in Mauritius, they stay at Pia's childhood home. Upon their arrival, it appears something is watching them from the upstairs window. While exploring her childhood nursery, it is made clear that Pia had a twin named Dia, and that the two were very close. That night, Pia has an out-of-body experience nightmare in which Dia comes in ghost form and tries to strangle her. Inanimate objects in the house are seen moving around, including a cross on the wall being turned upside down, and the swing outside moving as if someone were on it. The next morning while standing by the pool, Vic asks her if this was ""the place"", and a flashback is shown with Joe carrying Dia out of the pool, presumably dead. Pia is especially disturbed by this memory. She recalls that normally she was with her sister at all times, but the day Dia drowned she wasn't, and is unable to forgive herself for it. Joe is able to come home from the hospital the next day. While he is dining with Vic inside, Pia goes outside to check on Tracy, the dog. The swing is moving again and Tracy is barking ferociously at what appears to be nothing, until Pia kneels to pet the dog, and the girl's ghost is seen standing behind her. The ghost approaches her, but Pia sees nothing when she turns around. When she faces Tracy again, her hands are holding the ghost's face. When Carol comes up to her, Pia tells her about seeing Dia and Carol doesn't believe her. Pia tells Carol that since she's come back to Mauritius she's sensed something. The next morning, Pia vomits again and takes a pregnancy test which shows positive. When Pia tells the news to Carol, she seems unhappy about it and voices her concerns about Vic and the lead actress of his film. Carol dismisses it and encourages her to tell Vic, and that this chid could be what the two of them need to grow close again. Joe is sharing some old photos with Vic. He points out in one of the photos Dia's favorite doll that she took everywhere with her, and mentions she was buried with it. In another flashback, Susan is screaming at her daughter's death, and Joe believes that this is where everything changed, and that Dia's death brought on the mental instability in Susan. Vic receives a call from work saying that they need him back in Mumbai. He tries to reason with them, and becomes stressed. Pia walks in on him saying he's ""stuck"" in Mauritius, making her feel bad. She tells him if he wants to go back he can, and he confronts her about her distant attitude. Pia's doubts are the main cause for stress in their relationship, and he gets angry that she doesn't trust him. Pia tells him of her pregnancy and he is elated. The news puts a huge mend in to their relationship, thought it is still clear there is a supernatural presence. On Pia's birthday, someone blows out the candle before she has her chance, and the cake is infested with maggots. Later that night, she awakens to strange noises and goes to the nursery to check it out. A photo on the wall turns, and falls and breaks when Pia fixes it. Dia's ghost is crawling across the ceiling above and jumps down on her. Vic awakens to find that Pia is clearly not herself. Carol screams from outside, and Tracy is found dead with her intestines spilling out. Pia seems completely unfazed by the event which concerns Carol, knowing how much Pia loved that dog. While Carol calls her friend Aditya  about the unnatural happenings in the house and Pia's unusual behavior, the power goes out. Some knives that Joe had just put away were taken out again, and Pia is no longer where she had been reading. Carol finds her outside swinging with an expressionless look on her face. Carol suggests Pia visit Aditya, who is a parapsychologist to get some help for whatever is happening to her in that house. Carol also begins to experience unnatural things. While showering, another hand comes out of her hair. Pia invites Carol out to lunch. Suddenly, she leads Carol across the street to the subway station. She gets a call from Vic saying he's with Pia and she realizes that whoever she is with is not the real Pia. Carol flees screaming, and gets hit by a truck crossing the street. At the funeral, it is revealed that Aditya is in a wheelchair. He senses Pia's life is in danger and tells Vic to meet with him. While leaving the cemetery, Vic sees Dia's ghost for the first time. He wants to go back to Mumbai, but Pia insists on staying for a few more days. Pia is bathing in the middle of the night, and Vic comes in. He sees that it is not Pia, but the ghost who has possessed her. He tries to drown the ghost. Joe hears all the commotion, and when he reaches the bathroom, the ghost is gone and it's now Pia he's drowning. Joe is furious at Vic for seemingly trying to kill Pia, and won't listen to Vic's side of the story. Vic begins to research demonic possession as well as Aditya's credibility, and decides to heed Aditya's warning and meet with him. While Joe is visiting Pia in the hospital, she has what appears to be a seizure when she sees that her reflection in the mirror is staring at her, leading the doctors to believe she has epilepsy. Aditya explains all the medical symptoms used to describe possession, and that Pia is in the fourth of five stages of possession, and that the fifth stage is death. He suggests Vic start at the graveyard where he first saw Dia to search for answers. He happens upon Susan's grave, and goes back home. While looking at her portrait, Dia comes and stands next to him. Vic searches the attic and finds the doll that was buried with Dia. Underneath the doll is a video cassette and a truck containing diaries kept by Susan. He also uncovers some extremely morbid paintings by Susan featuring a dead fetus and images of suicide and inner turmoil. Vic visits the mental asylum, and the doctor that treated her suggests that she was mentally disturbed for a very long time and should have been brought in much earlier. On his way out, a janitor stops him and says that Susan wasn't insane, but in fact possessed by an evil spirit. Vic watches the DVD of the video cassette. There is a clip from the twins' birthday, and a clip from later that year. In the video, it is shown that Pia drowns Dia, and then gives the camera an evil smile before it shuts off. Adi too watches the video, and Vic insists on how much Pia loved her sister, and that she'd never do this. Adi suspects that there is only some truth to what they've seen and that the mystery remains unsolved. In the hospital, Pia is admiring her reflection in the window, rubbing her stomach. She pauses and realizes that her reflection is still staring at her, rubbing her stomach and causing her intense pain and causing her to contort. While watching the videotape over and over again, Adi realizes that on the video, Susan is showed scribbling away the same way she did in the asylum, showing that she was already possessed at that point. He also notices a third girl's reflection in the mirror behind the mother, realizing that Pia really wasn't with Dia that day. Vic returns to Susan's diaries in the year that Dia died and discovers more demonic drawings, and strange things like staples and threads. Vic realizes that Susan was pregnant with a third child, and it seems that the women in the family become possessed when pregnant, but neither Vic nor Adi can figure out why Susan did not become possessed while pregnant with Dia and Pia. Joe visits the hospital again after having a nightmare about Pia committing suicide in the same manner as her mother. Vic requests some information from Joe about Susan and is told to meet him at the hospital. Joe follows a possessed Pia to the rooftop, hoping to stop her from killing herself, but she throws him off the roof to his death. Instead, they must seek answers from an elder nurse at the hospital. Susan was pregnant not with twins, but triplets. Dia and Pia came out fine, but there were major complications in delivering the third child, and Joe had to take the decision to save Susan over the child. After realizing that it is the triplet's spirit agonizing the family, Vic wants to try exorcism, but Adi explains that at this point it is much too dangerous. To destroy the spirit, they kidnap Pia from the hospital and take her to Adi's workshop. A fight ensues between the spirit world and real world, and Adi takes on the spirit himself. The spirit kills him, but has left Pia's body. The spirit then begins to attack Vic, who using Adi's original plan, tries to defeats the spirit, but Pia must regain her strength and finish it off after Vic is injured. Pia goes in to labor and delivers a healthy, happy baby. Vic and she are elated. As Pia sleeps, we see the baby one last time, before its eyes go blank like the spirit's, implying that the spirit is now inside the baby and lives on."

Crip shoots the town marshal Issac Webb  and takes ten men as hostages, killing some to ensure the four are unmolested. The gang leaves town with $11,200 from the Bank of Paradise and a female hostage Helen Caldwell  who entered the bar because her alcoholic Uncle Billy  was one of the captives. Prior to these events, Marshal Webb had sent for a friend and former gunfighter Banner Cole to take his place in leading a posse to rescue Helen and bring the men to justice. Though not a criminal, Cole is a loner that Webb wishes to enter the community through his being deputised. Cole is enraged to discover that the townspeople have put Webb on a table next to the three dead bodies of those murdered by the four. The doctor  said at first they thought Webb was dead himself, then realised he couldn't be moved so left him among the corpses. Webb's last act is to deputise Cole telling him to do the right thing, not out of hate, but out of liking people as the townsfolk are good people who have had bad things done to them. Cole agrees only out of liking Webb. The laconic Cole makes his original plan for hunting down the four by himself clear by turning down the offer of Webb's handcuffs by saying ""I won't be needing any."" However, town elder Benson convinces Cole to follow Webb's wishes and organize a posse. The men of the town gather but enthusiasm wanes when not as many able bodied men as expected volunteer to go up against the killers, some men leaving because the posse doesn't outnumber the killers by ten to one. Cole's frank assessment of the situation scares others off with Cole saying ""If they're afraid of words they shouldn't go."" Cole's posse eventually consists of the aged former Army Captain Jeremiah Brown ([[Robert Keith , who wishes to lead the posse himself in the manner of his long ago Army days, Uncle Billy, Burt Hogan , who wishes to revenge his brother Burl  murdered by the four, Jock Wiley ([[Paul Carr , a young gunhand seeking the experience to establish his reputation as a gunfighter, Seymour Kern ([[John Saxon , a bank employee who has just arrived on a special assignment from the New York parent and is browbeaten into joining to look after the bank's missing money and avoid taunts of cowardice from the bank manager , and Johnny Caddo , an Indian who merely thinks that joining is ""the right thing to do."" Cole doesn't want any of the inexperienced and troublesome men to come with him but he has no choice. The posse discover Helen who has been left behind tied up near a rattlesnake that Cole is able to remove from Helen's vicinity. Helen has been raped and is unwilling to return to the town to face the shame of being vilified by the population. Cole orders the willing Uncle Billy to return her by force if necessary. Captain Brown demonstrates his aged incompetence by disobeying Cole's orders and opening fire and nearly murdering four cowhands who he mistakes for the four killers. Cole has to wound Jeremiah to stop his shooting spree and orders him back to town with the cowhands who have been waylaid by the killers. Cole's distrust of his own posse begins to subside when he is impressed by the determination of the inexperienced Seymour who has never ridden a horse or used a firearm before and the quiet Johnny Caddo's acceptance of the prejudicial treatment he gets from the posse. The posse tracks the four to a farmhouse and surrounds it until Hogan makes a noise starting a gunfight. Cole kills one of the outlaws. The boasting Wiley is unable to actually kill a man and is killed as he freezes, allowing the remaining three to escape. Hogan begins shooting the corpse of the outlaw that Cole himself killed telling himself and the posse that Hogan himself killed the man who killed his own brother. When the men note that all the witnesses agree that it was actually Hash who had murdered his brother, Hogan refuses to listen and leaves the posse to return to town. Cole, Caddo, and Seymour continue tracking the party to the desert but realise that the outlaws have doubled back and are intending on returning to shoot up Paradise."

Once they are out, he tells her that her next film has to differ in tone to the previous ones, and April is horrified to know that, in order to accomplish this, he has decided she has to have a baby. Her complaints fall on deaf ears to Ivan, who charges his press agent, Patsy Riley, with the job of finding one for a publicity stunt. Patsy's first thought is to enlist the help of Pennsylvania Railroad locomotive driver Maurice ""Mike"" Monaghan, an old boyfriend of hers and one of the regular drivers of the PRR's top-link express train, the Broadway Limited. Mike is at first delighted when he hears that they are travelling on the Limited, but is less enthused when he is assigned to try to find the baby required for the stunt. As he gloomily outlines the problem to the bartender of the engine shed cafe, an unknown man nearby overhears, and makes a telephone call before informing Mike that he has solved his problem. Mike is so glad to see his dilemma solved that he vows to remain his lifelong friend - but unknown to him, the kidnapping of a baby belonging to family named Pierson has made headline news. At Chicago Union Station, April's adopted baby attracts a great deal of attention from news reporters. They are watched as they board the Broadway Limited by a suspicious-looking stranger, who hands over some money to the man who helped Mike out of his predicament earlier before boarding the express himself. Mike has been rostered to the first leg of the journey from Chicago to Fort Wayne, where another crew is waiting to take the train on to Harrisburg. As they make their way along the line, he informs his fireman that he is taking his holiday in New York, and won't be returning to Chicago with him. The fireman is rather taken aback when he hears that Mike is travelling on the Limited, especially when he mentions that Patsy is on the train. Meanwhile, Patsy is met by Myra Prottle, the president of the Chicago April Tremaine Club. Patsy is just showing her into Ivan's compartment when she is called away, and when Ivan eventually emerges, he doesn't immediately recognise Miss Prottle and firmly orders her out. She re-enters shortly after on Patsy's prompting, but this time she is on hand to explain who exactly Miss Prottle is to Ivan before he can get rid of her again, whereupon Ivan takes out his annoyance on her at his own mistake and orders her to leave him and Miss Prottle in peace. In her own compartment, April is having trouble with the baby again, but isn't sure how to stop him crying. Thinking that he may be hungry, she leaves him in Patsy's care and goes to the buffet in the observation lounge, where she unexpectedly meets up with her childhood sweetheart, Dr Harvey North, who remembers her by her real name of Mary Potter. Their brief gossip is interrupted when Patsy reminds April about the baby; Harvey, who is especially gifted with children, follows to see if he can help. When they get back to April's compartment, she confides in Patsy that Ivan may have a point in what he had said on their way to the station, about being at home, nurturing her very own child - and a young husband. Realising that she is thinking of marrying Harvey, Patsy rushes back to Ivan's compartment to break the news to him. Meanwhile, Harvey is rather taken aback by the baby's similar appearance to April's, almost as if he were her own. April tries to explain that it is merely a publicity stunt, but Harvey cannot bring himself to believe this, and when she asks for Ivan's support, unaware that he is fearful of losing his leading lady, he denies that he had anything to do with it. Displeased at being fooled, Harvey walks out and returns to the observation saloon, and an angry April forces Ivan and Patsy out of her compartment along with the baby. At Fort Wayne, Mike hands his engine, K4 No. 3763, over to the relief crew and joins the train itself. While he is waiting in the dining car for Patsy, he is briefly harassed by a small boy before being joined at his table by Harvey. Patsy enters the dining car a little later with April and Miss Prottle. Seeing Harvey at Mike's table, April tries once again to reason with him, but Harvey still doesn't believe her. In the end she gets her way by telling him that Ivan was the father. Ivan soon approaches her table with the baby, and is confused when Harvey threatens to knock his teeth down his throat before storming off, but April smugly repeats to Ivan what she had said to Harvey. Horrified, Ivan leaves the baby with April and flees to his compartment to pack his suitcase, ordering the train porter to stop the train and let him off in spite of it being scheduled to run straight through to Harrisburg. The porter has only just gone to talk to the guard about it when Harvey comes to interrogate Ivan. Before he can do so, Ivan reveals to him that it was indeed a mere publicity stunt, leaving Harvey rather ashamed of himself. In the dining car, Mike has joined Patsy and Miss Prottle on their table and is explaining to Miss Prottle about various aspects of railroading. He has just finished explaining how he once avoided crashing into a derailed wagon when a goods train flashes past, causing Mike to leap from his seat and yell a greeting. He explains to Patsy and Miss Prottle that a friend/relative was driving the goods engine. Eventually, Patsy and Miss Prottle head off to help April with the baby, but before she leaves, Patsy and Mike agree to meet in the observation car later on. In the observation car, Mike is just leafing through a newspaper when another passenger comments about the Pierson kidnapping, which is still making headline news. He adds that the last such crime was foiled in just three weeks, the kidnapper being sentenced to death while the accomplice, who didn't realise that the kid had been taken hostage in the first place, was given 177 years - effectively a life sentence. Mike is shocked when he reads that the baby in question is similar in appearance to the one lent to April Tremaine, and was believed to have been heading east. When he sees that the other passenger is a detective, he hastily leaves the saloon and heads for Patsy's compartment to check the baby for the one detail that hasn't been seen yet; a mole on his left shoulder. By this time, Patsy and Miss Prottle have the baby ready for bed, but Miss Prottle insists on staying up late to listen to ""Renfrew of the Mounted"", a radio series of which she is a big fan. Mike hastily offers to look after the baby briefly while they go and listen to the latest installment on the observation saloon radio. As soon as they have gone, the suspicious character looks through the door and remarks to Mike about the baby, adding that he will be right outside if he needs any help. He shuts the door behind him, and Mike pulls the baby's shirt down to look at his shoulder. Sure enough, he sees a dark patch similar to a mole. In the observation saloon, ""Renfrew of the Mounted"" is just finishing when Mike comes in and tries to explain their dilemma to Patsy while Miss Prottle takes charge of the baby, but Patsy is so annoyed at his anxious rambling that she mistakes it for lack of interest in her, and accordingly walks out on him. Realising that he is on his own, Mike reacts by collecting every newspaper in the train before discarding them through the carriage window. In the observation saloon, meanwhile, Harvey tries to apologise to April for his misunderstanding, but April refuses to hear him out. Ivan, who had opted to stay on the train after all, steps in and reminds Harvey that he is a mere, underpaid doctor, and advises that he shouldn't interfere with her career any longer. Although suspicious that Ivan may have ulterior motives, Harvey reluctantly agrees; however, his guilt quickly catches up with him again, and his attempts to make up with April are constantly foiled by Ivan staring warily out of his compartment. Ironically, every time he himself tries to talk with April, Harvey catches him out. This goes on until they catch Mike leaving April's compartment. Both are taken aback by this, unaware that Mike was really helping to open April's suitcase. Later that night, Patsy is woken by a sleepless Mike, who tells her that, unbeknown to him until too late, the baby had been kidnapped. Thankfully, Patsy has a plan, and puts Mike in charge of the baby until they get a chance to drop him off at a station. Mike takes the baby back to his compartment and keeps him occupied by telling him ""The Three Bears"" until he falls asleep mid-story. Shortly, Patsy comes and informs him that the train has made an unscheduled stop. Mike takes this opportunity to leave the baby in the booking office of the nearby station, but just as he leaves the building, the suspicious man finds the baby with a note in his crib: ""PLEASE RETURN TO CHICAGO; NOTIFY POLICE"". He screws up the note and surreptitiously returns the baby to April's compartment. When Mike returns, he finds that the train is being held up for two and a half hours; there is a flood in the valley, and the express engine has been commandeered to take a consignment of coal trucks to the town affected by the flood. The other engine, a D16, is unable to make it fast enough. Mike suggests that they use the smaller engine to pull the Broadway Limited, but the driver and fireman are sceptical, saying that they ""couldn't get enough head on that to haul the Limited around the block"". Mike however is insistent, and challenges the superintendent, Mulcany, into firing the engine for him. With that, Mike and Mulcany prepare the D16 while No. 3673 is shunted onto the coal trucks. The D16 slips violently at first, but with careful handling and some sand on the rails, Mike manages to get the express rolling again. Back on the train, Miss Prottle realises that the baby is missing and frantically tells Ivan, who orders the guard to call for the police. Patsy overhears and rushes Miss Prottle back to bed before repeating to Ivan what Mike had told her. Realising that they are headed for prison cells if the police are sent for, Ivan rushes off to order the guard not to send off the message, only to find he is too late. But almost immediately after he finds this out, he remembers that the baby is missing anyway, so they have no need to worry. Meanwhile, April is woken up to find the baby on her bedside table. Although confused at first as to how the baby got into her compartment and why he is wide awake, she sees a chance to make up her dispute with Harvey, and asks the porter to send for him. When Harvey arrives, he deduces that the baby just isn't tired, much to April's relief, but kindly offers to stay and keep an eye on him. By this time April is beginning to realise just how right Ivan was about babies, and expresses to Harvey a desire to have one of her own. Ivan's words are still playing on Harvey's mind, however, and he is therefore rather pessimistic about this until April tells him that she has had enough of making films with Ivan. They both head off to Ivan's compartment, where April confesses her love to Harvey, and the two of them share a kiss just as Ivan opens his door. Ivan is horrified, not only because Harvey went back on his word, but also at April's intention to quit from Hollywood and marry Harvey. They leave Ivan pacing back and forth in his compartment, ranting and raving to himself in Russian as he tries desperately to work out a way round it. By dawn, Ivan is still pacing in his compartment, unable to sleep, when he hits on a compromise whereby  everyone will win. Excited, he heads off to Harvey's compartment and, admitting that he has been rather heartless up till now, proposes to build Harvey's life-ambition - ""the finest clinic that science can dream up/money can buy"". Harvey is unconvinced at first, but Ivan promises to pay him the required $50,000 and give him a contract before he leaves the train. While they are discussing this, the express enters Harrisburg, where it is to change engines and proceed to New York behind a GG1 electric locomotive. As soon as they have stopped, Mulcany congratulates Mike on his expert handling of the little D16 and wishes him a nice holiday. Mike returns to the train feeling pleased with himself, unaware that the police have begun to search the Limited for the baby. Following a brief visit from one of the policemen, Ivan confides in Harvey about their predicament, and is shocked to hear from Harvey that the baby is still aboard the train. He runs back to April's compartment, where April is just dressing the baby for the day, and explains to her how he had been kidnapped. Patsy enters shortly after, and is shocked to find the baby on April's bed. Ivan hands her the baby and forces her into her own compartment before hastily organising a ruse with April; as soon as the policeman enters, April pretends to be distraught while Ivan keeps him occupied for a short while. Back in Patsy's compartment, Mike comes to inform Patsy that everything is under control - but Patsy reveals that the baby is back aboard the train, much to his bewilderment. He takes the baby back into April's compartment just in time to avoid being caught out by Miss Prottle and the policeman, whom Miss Prottle mistakes for ""Renfrew of the Mounted"". The policemen soon come to the conclusion that the baby isn't on the train, and head back to make their report. With the coast clear and the engines changed, Mike heads to his compartment with the baby while Ivan, Patsy, April and Harvey try to find a way out of their crisis. Ivan suggests that they get off at Philadelphia, but Patsy reminds him that they will be rounded up by the police even if they don't stay on the train until New York. At Philadelphia, the suspicious man is met by another two men, who join the train for the last few miles to New York. Back in April's compartment, Patsy, Harvey, April and Ivan are still desperately trying to find a solution to their problem - until Miss Prottle points out that they are all heroes. Harvey and April realise that they needn't have worried about the baby after all; they just have to hand him to the police, and they will be on the front page of every newspaper in the USA. At that moment, Mike comes in and announces that he is going to surrender as soon as they reach New York, to which all eagerly agree. Patsy sends him to get the baby, and Mike, elated when he hears that they will all be received to a hero's welcome, instantly obliges. Shortly after, the guard hands Ivan the contract and a $50,000 cheque for the clinic. Harvey is just signing the contract when Mike bursts back into the room in a panic, saying that the baby has gone. All six of them spread out to look for the baby, whom Mike eventually finds with the suspicious stranger. He approaches him, demanding the baby back, but the other two passengers try to restrain him. Mike, however, is too strong for them, and knocks them down before hanging the suspicious passenger on the coat-hanger. Patsy enters and is about to take the baby when the other two passengers come round and bar her way, only to be overpowered once again by Mike. On arrival at Pennsylvania Station, it is revealed that the Pierson baby had been found the night before, and that the suspicious-looking man was actually the baby's father; he had let them use the baby for the publicity stunt on the basis that he could use the $500 reward for a family reunion. The other two characters, he adds, are his brother and brother-in-law from Philadelphia. Mike points out what he believes is a mole on the baby's shoulder, but it turns out to be a false beauty mark that Miss Prottle had lost. With their misunderstanding sorted out, Patsy heads off to Niagara Falls with Mike while the flustered father leaves for his reunion. Before Harvey and April leave, however, they read through the contract and find that the clinic is to be located right across the street from Ivan's studio, possibly indicating that Ivan intended to keep April as his leading lady without interfering too much with her private life with Harvey. As for Miss Prottle, she chases after another policeman, once again believing him to be Renfrew."

They both head off to Ivan's compartment, where April confesses her love to Harvey, and the two of them share a kiss just as Ivan opens his door. Ivan is horrified, not only because Harvey went back on his word, but also at April's intention to quit from Hollywood and marry Harvey. They leave Ivan pacing back and forth in his compartment, ranting and raving to himself in Russian as he tries desperately to work out a way round it. By dawn, Ivan is still pacing in his compartment, unable to sleep, when he hits on a compromise whereby  everyone will win. Excited, he heads off to Harvey's compartment and, admitting that he has been rather heartless up till now, proposes to build Harvey's life-ambition - ""the finest clinic that science can dream up/money can buy"". Harvey is unconvinced at first, but Ivan promises to pay him the required $50,000 and give him a contract before he leaves the train. While they are discussing this, the express enters Harrisburg, where it is to change engines and proceed to New York behind a GG1 electric locomotive. As soon as they have stopped, Mulcany congratulates Mike on his expert handling of the little D16 and wishes him a nice holiday. Mike returns to the train feeling pleased with himself, unaware that the police have begun to search the Limited for the baby. Following a brief visit from one of the policemen, Ivan confides in Harvey about their predicament, and is shocked to hear from Harvey that the baby is still aboard the train. He runs back to April's compartment, where April is just dressing the baby for the day, and explains to her how he had been kidnapped. Patsy enters shortly after, and is shocked to find the baby on April's bed. Ivan hands her the baby and forces her into her own compartment before hastily organising a ruse with April; as soon as the policeman enters, April pretends to be distraught while Ivan keeps him occupied for a short while. Back in Patsy's compartment, Mike comes to inform Patsy that everything is under control - but Patsy reveals that the baby is back aboard the train, much to his bewilderment. He takes the baby back into April's compartment just in time to avoid being caught out by Miss Prottle and the policeman, whom Miss Prottle mistakes for ""Renfrew of the Mounted"". The policemen soon come to the conclusion that the baby isn't on the train, and head back to make their report. With the coast clear and the engines changed, Mike heads to his compartment with the baby while Ivan, Patsy, April and Harvey try to find a way out of their crisis. Ivan suggests that they get off at Philadelphia, but Patsy reminds him that they will be rounded up by the police even if they don't stay on the train until New York. At Philadelphia, the suspicious man is met by another two men, who join the train for the last few miles to New York. Back in April's compartment, Patsy, Harvey, April and Ivan are still desperately trying to find a solution to their problem - until Miss Prottle points out that they are all heroes. Harvey and April realise that they needn't have worried about the baby after all; they just have to hand him to the police, and they will be on the front page of every newspaper in the USA. At that moment, Mike comes in and announces that he is going to surrender as soon as they reach New York, to which all eagerly agree. Patsy sends him to get the baby, and Mike, elated when he hears that they will all be received to a hero's welcome, instantly obliges. Shortly after, the guard hands Ivan the contract and a $50,000 cheque for the clinic. Harvey is just signing the contract when Mike bursts back into the room in a panic, saying that the baby has gone. All six of them spread out to look for the baby, whom Mike eventually finds with the suspicious stranger. He approaches him, demanding the baby back, but the other two passengers try to restrain him. Mike, however, is too strong for them, and knocks them down before hanging the suspicious passenger on the coat-hanger. Patsy enters and is about to take the baby when the other two passengers come round and bar her way, only to be overpowered once again by Mike. On arrival at Pennsylvania Station, it is revealed that the Pierson baby had been found the night before, and that the suspicious-looking man was actually the baby's father; he had let them use the baby for the publicity stunt on the basis that he could use the $500 reward for a family reunion. The other two characters, he adds, are his brother and brother-in-law from Philadelphia. Mike points out what he believes is a mole on the baby's shoulder, but it turns out to be a false beauty mark that Miss Prottle had lost. With their misunderstanding sorted out, Patsy heads off to Niagara Falls with Mike while the flustered father leaves for his reunion. Before Harvey and April leave, however, they read through the contract and find that the clinic is to be located right across the street from Ivan's studio, possibly indicating that Ivan intended to keep April as his leading lady without interfering too much with her private life with Harvey. As for Miss Prottle, she chases after another policeman, once again believing him to be Renfrew."

Just then, Monro's assistant Charles Darwin  arrives with a forged letter stating that dead bodies must be sent to Monro. Angus is then left to tell Knox's assistant, Patterson , that the bodies are now being given to Monro. Patterson delivers the message to Knox. The film then switches to William Burke  and William Hare , two immigrants from Ireland, attempting to sell cheese mould which they state is growing moss. When they are found out, they flee back to an Inn owned by Hare's wife Lucky , who states that one of their lodgers has died. Burke and Hare decide to transport the corpse to Knox. They are forced to break the corpse's spine in order to fit inside the barrel. While on the way to Knox's house, they stop at a bar, and while there, a young woman, Helen McDougal  - under the name Ginny Hawkins - a former prostitute, attempts to attract the attention of everyone in the bar by doing an extract from the William Shakespeare play Macbeth. While everyone else in the bar take no notice Burke begins talking to Ginny and asks her why she did so. Ginny explains that it was her ambition to become an actress. While Burke and Ginny have a drink together, Hare tells Burke that they had better set off to Knox's castle. Burke and Hare arrive at Knox's house and present the now mangled corpse to Knox. Knox then agrees that if the pair bring him two bodies a week for dissection, he will pay them a large amount of money. While Burke sees this as his chance to help Ginny's ambition of becoming an actress, Hare is content on using the money to open a funeral parlour. When Burke and Hare return to the Inn, they find Lucky drunk and nearly unconscious. Lucky explains why she is in that state as it is Joseph , another lodger at the Inn, is near death. Burke and Hare see this as their chance to make a start, before Joseph can die himself they suffocate him and take his body to Knox, who gives them both a large amount of money. Burke and Hare share out the money, and Burke goes to find Ginny. Burke tells Ginny the good news, and she hugs him and allows him to take her home, while Hare goes to the bar where he meets Fergus ([[David Schofield , the suffering henchman of villain Danny McTavish . Fergus explains that McTavish is using him to cheat at games of gambling and taking all the money for himself while not sharing it with Fergus. Hare explains that he has to transport two bodies a week to Knox and receives a lot of money for it. Fergus tells this to McTavish. Later, while Burke is leaving the bar after telling Ginny the good news, he is bundled into a horse carriage along with an already captured Hare, and comes face to face with McTavish and Fergus. McTavish explains that if Burke and Hare want to be kept alive, they must pay him half of the money they earn from Knox, and in exchange McTavish will provide them with protection. With their only option to agree, Burke and Hare are flung from the carriage while it is going through a wood. As Burke and Hare make their way back to the Inn, they begin coming up with plans of whom to kill each week. As more and more people turn up dead, Lucky begins to get suspicious, as does the local law enforcement lead by Capt Tom McLintock , who visits Lord Harrington  and William Wordsworth  and informs them. Harrington and Wordsworth give McLintock permission to hunt down the criminals and have them hanged. Following this, Hare is once again kidnapped by McTavish, who orders both he and Fergus to hand over their money for protection. While Hare and Fergus look at each other, the scene snaps to the dissecting theatre, where McTavish's corpse turns up for Knox to dissect. This causes outrage, and as Burke and Ginny's auditions begin, Burke and Ginny are captured by McLintock while about to make love while Hare and Lucky are captured while having sex. All of them are locked in different cells, and are informed that if one of them admits to the murders, the others will go free. Burke agrees to do so on one condition, that he is put in the same cell as Ginny so they can finally make love. The following day, Burke awaits his hanging at the gallows. Angus announces that if Burke has any last words he should say them now. Burke then states ""Only this"", before turning to look at Ginny in the crowd, and states ""I did it for love"", before he is hanged. Angus then tells how each character goes their separate ways, before the camera zooms up on the skeleton of Burke in a present day museum."

Run Wild, Run Free , directed by Richard C. Sarafian, is occasionally graced with experimental, art film touches, as when, at one point the internal thoughts of Philip's mother  describing her fatigue and inability to love her son can be heard as voice-over as they drive to a therapist appointment. Out roaming the moors, Philip encounters the kindly, nature-loving retired Colonel  who is deeply sympathetic to the boy's plight. Like the nature that surrounds him -- the film was shot on location in Dartmoor, Devon, England -- the boy is a creature of mute-impulse who must be patiently tamed and drawn out just like the animals he encounters.

284525The Tweedys are a middle-aged couple who run their chicken farm somewhere in Yorkshire, England. Mrs. Tweedy serves as the genius but high-tempered wife of Mr. Tweedy, who is rather slow and timid, but handles his manual work industriously. The coop is run in the style of a World War II POW camp, with the chickens accountable for the number of eggs they lay daily. One chicken, Ginger, who is often treated as the chickens' leader, has attempted numerous plans to flee the coop, aided by contraband smuggled in by two rats, Nick and Fetcher. However, Ginger is routinely captured by Mr. Tweedy and his dogs, and is thrown into a coal bin for solitary confinement numerous times. Ginger is finally released from the coal bin just in time for roll call the next day. Mrs. Tweedy finds on her clipboard that a chicken named Edwina had not laid any eggs. With that, Mrs. Tweedy grabs Edwina and takes her to ""the chop"". Mrs. Tweedy beheads Edwina with a hatchet and cooks her for dinner. Ginger becomes increasingly desperate to find a plan of escape which will work, faces problems with Nick and Fetcher, who are tired of being paid with chicken feed and want eggs instead. Meanwhile, Mrs. Tweedy realizes that the couple's farm is failing, and reads a catalogue on an ambiguous method of increasing profits at the couple's farm. Ginger, realizing something is wrong, attempts to convince herself and the other chickens to speed up their efforts to escape. However, Ginger soon comes to the conclusion that the only escape route is to go over the fence, something Ginger and the other chickens cannot do. Later that same night, as Ginger sits outside, she sees a Rhode Island Red cockerel that seemingly flies over the fence and accidentally crashes into the coop. The other chicken fawn over the new arrival, who introduces himself as Rocky, while Ginger finds the first half of a poster with a picture of Rocky on it; showing it to the other chickens and explaining how Rocky came in, Ginger claims that Rocky can fly. Upon discovering that Rocky is from a circus, Ginger agrees to hide Rocky from his owners if he teaches them how to fly. Rocky reluctantly agrees, but due to injuring his wing as a result of his landing, he cannot show them immediately. Instead, Rocky puts Ginger and the other chickens through a set of exercises that seem to have no purpose while assuring them that all the chickens are making progress. Meanwhile, a large pie-making machine arrives, which Mr. Tweedy begins assembling. At the same time, Mrs. Tweedy orders food rations doubled. Ginger proclaims that their intent is to fatten them up, and then kill them, only for Rocky to drag her off. The two of them argue, Rocky claiming that Ginger's honesty will demoralize the chickens, and Ginger refusing to lie to the other hens. Discovering that the chickens have gone into depression following Ginger's announcement, Rocky organizes a party using a radio obtained by Nick and Fetcher, and he and Ginger grow closer whilst dancing. During the party, Rocky's arm is shown to have healed. Once the pie machine is complete, the Tweedys kidnap Ginger for its first test. Rocky follows Ginger into the machine and eventually rescues her, damaging the machine and giving Rocky and Ginger more time to work on their escape. Fowler, an older cockerel who has been doubting of Rocky's acts, gives him his respect for rescuing Ginger and his old Royal Air Force  badge in tribute. Rocky decides to flee the farm the next day, leaving behind Fowler's medal and the second half of his poster, showing that he was actually a stunt cockerel, only ""flying"" by being shot out of a cannon. This revelation outrages the other chickens, and a fight soon breaks out as morale falls. When Fowler arrives to try and restore order, he begins talking of his days in the RAF, leading Ginger to realize that she and the other chickens can build a plane made from Fowler's pictures and personal recollections. Supplied by Nick and Fetcher, the chickens race against time to assemble their plane as the Tweedys work to repair the pie machine. The chickens finally finish their plane just as Mr. Tweedy unexpectedly completes all the repairs of the pie machine and enters the coop to grab all the chickens. However, the chickens launch an open revolt, tying up and gagging Mr. Tweedy and readying the plane. As the chickens prepare for take-off, Mr. Tweedy ends up freeing himself and knocks down the ramp used to get the plane airborne. Ginger jumps down while Fowler turns the plane around, which knocks Mr. Tweedy unconscious. As Ginger struggles to lift the ramp, Mrs. Tweedy arrives and attempts to kill Ginger with her used hatchet. However, Rocky, having had a change of heart, jumps over the fence aboard his tricycle and hits Mrs. Tweedy in her face, briefly knocking her senseless. Rocky and Ginger grab onto the string of lights caught on the plane's landing gear as the plane takes off, but Mrs. Tweedy soon awakens and also grabs the lights, weighing down the plane. Ginger heads down the string to cut it, but accidentally loses her scissors. Realizing what is the only way left to cut the lights, Ginger manages to trick Mrs. Tweedy into using the hatchet to sever the string, which causes Mrs. Tweedy to fall, crash into the pie machine, and plugging her into the safety valve. This causes the pie machine to build-up pressure and explode in a mushroom cloud of gravy, destroying the barn and covering the entire farm with gravy, leaving only just the barn door standing. The chickens continue to fly to freedom as Mr. Tweedy reminds Mrs. Tweedy: ""I told you they was organized"". Mr. Tweedy later drops the door on top of Mrs. Tweedy before she can lash out on him. In the epilogue, the chickens find their idyllic setting in a bird sanctuary, where they can live in comfort and raise their new chicks. Rocky and Ginger, having fallen in love with each other, become a couple. Meanwhile, Nick and Fetcher discuss their plans of starting their own chicken farm, so they can have all the eggs they could eat. However, Nick and Fetcher ends up arguing with each other over whether the chicken or the egg came first. Their argument ultimately continues during the closing credits and even involves Rocky breaking it up in a post-credits scene.
4024830Preparing to leave for Delhi, Purushan bids his mother goodbye, promising to write to her regularly. In the thinly populated forest area of Wayanad in the north-east of Kerala, the jeep in which he is travelling is stopped by the Police, who take possession of it to carry a dead body found hanging on the wayside tree. The dead man's face looks familiar to Purushan. He becomes restless and is seized with a pathological obsession to find out the identity of the deceased. Against the wishes of his girl friend, he abandons his trip to Delhi and sets out to seek his friends who may have some clue. Purushan meets journalist friends, doctors, and finally a veteran comrade, fondly addressed as Balettan who identifies the dead as the fellow musician who accompanied Satyajit, the guitarist. Satyajit confirms the deceased is his friend Hari, the tabla player. Together they decide to inform Hari's mother who stays in Cochin. They set out on a long eventful journey from the northern highlands of Wayanad to the Southern port city of Cochin. As they move from Calicut to, Beypore, Kodungalloor, Thrissur, Kottapuram, Vypin, and finally to Fort Kochi , the group swells as they meet many mothers and their sons and relatives who have known Hari; some had known him as a tabla player, some as Tony, the jazz drummer and others as a silent political activist, a victim of police brutality, and a loner. And for others he was a drug addict and one who used to drown his sorrow and pain in his music. Through their recollections, Hari's rather diffused identity unfolds. His classmates remember Hari as an introvert, weak and indecisive. His worker comrades identify him as a staunch revolutionary with a strong resistance and will power. But then what went wrong? The colonial past of the places, what they took from us and what they left behind as well as the peoples protests and uprisings, the region witnesses and their heroes and victims are integrated into the narrative, by way of information as well as critiquing. While reporting to his mother about Hari and his friends and their mothers on his southbound journey, John also reconstructs the history of the land through a series of class struggles, student protests, and workers union clashes that took place in the region where Purushan traversed. Starting with the medical students agitation against commercialization of medical education, to a short dialogue with Karuppuswamy, the unfortunate victim who had lost both his legs in a colliery workers struggle for better wages and human dignity, in Kottapuram, to Vypin island where several mazdoors  either died or lost their eyesight in the man-made hooch tragedy, to the Citizens group's forcible taking over of rice and sugar hoarded by unscrupulous black marketer traders and distributing to ordinary people at fair prices and giving back the money collected to the traders, to the manipulated fight between workers of two feuding unions in a Mattanchery street in Fort Kochi, where four fishermen had died, and also some targeted working class leaders in a fake Police encounter, an abortive factory workers strike extending solidarity to the retrenched women workers in Fort Kochi, are some of the long list of peoples protests and struggles reported with deep concern and feeling by Purushan in a long letter to his Mother. As Purushan and his group wait for Hari's mother to come out of the Baptism ceremony from the church, they analyse their own past, note the emerging debate focusing on the romantic evasions and tragic failures of the extremist movement. When Hari s mother finally turns up and faces the youth congregation, she asks ""Suicide wasn't it?"" The film ends with Purushan's mother watching Hari's mother wiping her tear.
10004330During World War II, a Marine battalion prepares to land on a large Japanese-held island in the Pacific. Lieutenant Colonel Gilfillan  warns the men that it will be a tough mission, and that they have been ordered to take prisoners in order to gain information about the Japanese fortifications. Below deck, veteran Lieutenant Carl A. Anderson , a chemistry teacher in civilian life, questions his former student, Corporal Stuart Conroy , who complains that he is ill and cannot fight. Anderson assures him that he has shown courage before and can do so again. In the landing boat heading to shore, Navy corpsman C. E. ""Doc"" Jones  is worried because Anderson has been suffering from ""psychological migraines"" for months. Anderson and his platoon have been fighting since Guadalcanal, and now only seven men remain of the original platoon. Although Doc urged Anderson to seek treatment in the United States, Anderson refuses to leave his men and has been relying on Doc to supply him with painkillers. The men hit the beach and successfully dig in, despite an initial burst of resistance. As four days pass, the seven old timers in Anderson's platoon, including Pigeon Lane , Sergeant Zelenko , Slattery , Coffman , and the unstable ""Pretty Boy"" Riley , grow weary of the constant threat of hidden Japanese snipers. One day, the men try to take a ridge of hills, but are beaten back by Japanese rockets, which come as an unpleasant surprise to the commanding officers. When Coffman  is killed, Anderson is forced to take some more of Doc's pills. Anderson meets with other officers at battalion headquarters, where Gilfillan recounts the troubles they are having capturing prisoners and getting information from them. Sergeant Randolph Johnson , a Japanese linguist who uses psychology in interrogating prisoners, questions a POW who has been dubbed ""Willie."" As Gilfillan receives orders to stop the rockets within nine hours, before the next assault on the hills, Willie informs Johnson that the Japanese soldiers holding a cave stronghold are willing to surrender. Accompanied by Johnson and war correspondent Sergeant Dickerman , Anderson leads a patrol to the cave, but they are ambushed and Zelenko is blinded. The men capture the remaining Japanese, including a wounded officer, four laborers and a shell-shocked, elderly civilian. Anderson finds a map on the wounded officer. On the return trip, a sniper shoots at Pretty Boy, who kills him during hand-to-hand combat. The confrontation further unbalances him and he attempts to murder the prisoners. Lane then accidentally shoots and kills Pretty Boy while attempting to stop him. Doc also dies, but not before giving Dickerman a message for Anderson. Anderson takes his prisoners to headquarters, where the wounded officer commits hara-kiri with a knife he had stolen from Johnson. While map expert Lieutenant Butterfield works on a Japanese map overlay found in Pretty Boy's personal effects, Anderson and Johnson learn that one of the POWs is actually an important officer pretending to be a private. From his prideful statements, Johnson deduces where the rockets are located. Anderson learns that Conroy has been killed. Anderson takes the news hard and is ready to give up. Dickerman reads aloud Doc's note, however, and Anderson, inspired by Doc's appeal for him to be strong for the sake of those whom he survives, throws away his painkillers and again leads his men into battle. Then, as the film closes, U.S. Corsairs fly in and smash the Japanese position, leading Anderson to scream to his men, ""GIVE 'EM HELL"" whiich they echo in unison.

While Man investigates Shiraishi Inc., who expressed interest in Ho's chip, Ho is brought before Alexander Wolfe, who wants his chip to take over the minds of the phone's users. He coerces Prof. Ho into helping him. Man's investigation takes him to Zenda City , where Shiraishi is headquartered. His friend on the local force, Lt. Lisa Hayashi, takes him to the CEO, who is already seeing his niece, Lulu Wong. Later, the CEO's daughter Tina is kidnapped by Morris and Jane, and Lulu intervenes. The camera on Morris' head transmits images of Lulu to his boss , who deduces who Silver Hawk is. The crooks escape, and Man brings her to the local police station and asks her about her kung fu skills, which she had earlier denied maintaining. Outside the station, they see the CEO driving away and follow him, knowing that he'd refused to cooperate with police. They tail him to a meeting with Wolfe, who whisks him away in a helicopter before the two can intervene. All Lulu can do is take a picture of Wolfe and later send it to Kit, knowing that he's a fan. Wolfe wants the CEO to put Ho's chip in a new phone and distribute them in exchange for his daughter. Later, he forces Prof. Ho to speed up his preparation of the subliminal messages that phones will transmit, despite possible long-term damage to the user's mind. Ho manages to slip a secret message into the phone's computer code. Days later, Shiraishi is promoting its new phone, and the CEO is more focused on that than on seeing Lulu about his daughter. Lulu goes to her apartment and finds flowers and a message from Wolfe to meet him about Tina. As she's about to leave, she finds Man, who has begun to guess who Silver Hawk is, waiting outside to talk to her. She tells him to wait in the hotel bar, but he leaves some tracking chips on top of the door. when she leaves, the chips fall onto her hair, and he tracks her to her meeting. Inside the building, she meets Wolfe, who then sends four men attached to bungee cords to attack Silver Hawk and leap away before she can respond. She manages to fend them off until Wolfe injures her shoulder with his prosthetic arms. She then uses one bungee cord to leap up to a window and escape. Man tracks her to where she'd passed out from the pain and takes her to his apartment to confront her about her vigilante actions. This is interrupted when Kit walks in and start to blab about the e-mail he'd sent her about Wolfe. Man drags him away to get the information about Wolfe. That interrogation is interrupted by a newsflash about the CEO's support of Wolfe to run for premier. Kit sees how unnatural the CEO's face is; Man sees he's wearing a new phone. The two investigate the connection. As Lulu bathes to heal her shoulder, she recalls a lesson her teacher gave her about the nature of water and kung fu. This gives her an idea on how to deal with Wolfe. The next day, Kit has discovered the secret message Prof. Ho put in the code. Wolfe plans to activate the mind control in a few hours, but they don't know where to look for him until Silver Hawk sends them the address. There, the police battle Wolfe's thugs until Silver Hawk arrives to help put them away. Kit finds a way to Wolfe's lair and then tend to Prof. Ho while Silver Hawk and Man battle Wolfe and his men. She uses cloths attached to her flying blades to subdue his prosthetics, and she and Man finally defeat him. But they must use Wolfe's retinal scan to stop the process, so Kit tricks him into opening his eyes. This foils his plan but also activates the self-destruct system. Silver Hawk and the rest escape, but Wolfe is crushed to death. Back in Polaris City, Lulu has a date with Man. He's called away on official business, leaving the question of whether he'd arrest Lulu unanswered. Silver Hawk later drives up next to man, and the two tease each other about their signature moves.

196923The scenario of the film as originally written by Gance was published in 1927 by Librairie Plon. Much of the scenario describes scenes that were rejected during initial editing, and do not appear in any known version of the film. The following plot includes only those scenes that are known to have been included in some version of the film. Not every scene described below can be viewed today.Brownlow 1983, p. 264   In the winter of 1779–1780, ten-year-old Napoleon Buonaparte  is enrolled at Brienne College, a military school for sons of nobility, run by the religious Minim Fathers in Brienne-le-Château, France. The boys at the school are holding a snowball fight organised as a battlefield. Two bullies—Philippeaux  and Peccaduc —schoolyard antagonists of Napoleon, are leading the larger side, outnumbering the side that Napoleon fights for. These two sneak up on Napoleon with snowballs enclosing stones. A hardened snowball draws blood on Napoleon's face. Napoleon is warned of another rock-snowball by a shout from Tristan Fleuri , the school's scullion and a friend to Napoleon. Napoleon recovers himself and dashes alone to the enemy snowbank to engage the two bullies in close combat. The Minim Fathers, watching the snowball fight from windows and doorways, applaud the action. Napoleon returns to his troops and encourages them to attack ferociously. He watches keenly and calmly as this attack progresses, assessing the balance of the struggle and giving appropriate orders. He smiles as his troops turn the tide of battle. Carrying his side's flag, he leads his forces in a final charge and raises the flag at the enemy stronghold. The monks come out of the school buildings to discover who led the victory. A young military instructor, Jean-Charles Pichegru , asks Napoleon for his name. Napoleon responds ""Nap-eye-ony"" in Corsican-accented French, and is laughed at by the others. Pichegru tells him that he will go far. In class, the boys study geography. Napoleon is angered by the condescending textbook description of Corsica. He is taunted by the other boys, and kicked by the two bullies who hold flanking seats. Another of the class's island examples is Saint Helena, which puts Napoleon into a pensive daydream. Unhappy in school, Napoleon writes about his difficulties in a letter to his family. A bully reports to a monk that Napoleon is hiding letters in his bed, and the monk tears the letter to pieces. Angry, Napoleon goes to visit the attic quarters of his friend Fleuri, a place of refuge where Napoleon keeps his captive bird, a young eagle that was sent to him from Corsica by an uncle. Napoleon tenderly pets the eagle's head, then leaves to fetch water for the bird. The two bullies take this opportunity to set the bird free. Napoleon finds the bird gone and runs to the dormitory to demand the culprit show himself. None of the boys admits to the deed. Napoleon exclaims that they are all guilty, and begins to fight them all, jumping from bed to bed. In the clash, pillows are split and feathers fly through the air as the Minim Fathers work to restore order. They collar Napoleon and throw him outside in the snow. Napoleon cries to himself on the limber of a cannon, then he looks up to see the young eagle in a tree. He calls to the eagle which flies down to the cannon barrel. Napoleon caresses the eagle and smiles through his tears.  In 1792, the great hall of the Club of the Cordeliers is filled with revolutionary zeal as hundreds of members wait for a meeting to begin. The leaders of the group, Georges Danton , Jean-Paul Marat  and Maximilien Robespierre , are seen conferring. Camille Desmoulins , Danton's secretary, interrupts Danton to tell of a new song that has been printed, called ""La Marseillaise"". A young army captain, Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle  has written the words and brought the song to the club. Danton directs de Lisle to sing the song to the club. The sheet music is distributed and the club learns to sing the song, rising in fervor with each passage. At the edge of the crowd, Napoleon , now a young army lieutenant, thanks de Lisle as he leaves: ""Your hymn will save many a cannon."" Splashed with water in a narrow Paris street, Napoleon is noticed by Joséphine de Beauharnais  and Paul Barras  as they step from a carriage on their way into the house of Mademoiselle Lenormand , the fortune teller. Inside, Lenormand exclaims to Joséphine that she has the amazing fortune to be the future queen. On the night of 10 August 1792, Napoleon watches impassively as mob rule takes over Paris and a man is hung by revolutionaries. In front of the National Assembly, Danton tells the crowd that they have cracked the monarchy. Napoleon senses a purpose rising within him, to bring order to the chaos. The mob violence has tempered his character. Napoleon, on leave from the French Army, travels to Corsica with his sister, Élisa . They are greeted by his mother, Letizia Buonaparte  and the rest of his family at their summer home in Les Milelli. The shepherd Santo-Ricci  interrupts the happy welcome to tell Napoleon the bad news that Corsica's president, Pasquale Paoli  is planning to give the island to the British. Napoleon declares his intention to prevent this fate. Riding a horse and revisiting places of his childhood, Napoleon stops in Milelli gardens and considers whether to retreat and protect his family, or to advance into the political arena. Later in the streets of Ajaccio, Pozzo di Borgo  encourages a mob to put Napoleon to death for opposing Paoli, and the townsfolk surround the Buonaparte home. Napoleon stands outside the door and stares the crowd down, dispersing them silently. Paoli signs a death warrant, putting a price on Napoleon's head. Napoleon's brothers, Lucien  and Joseph , leave for Calvi to see if French authorities can intervene. Napoleon faces the danger alone, walking into an inn where men are arguing politics, all of whom would like to see him dead. He confronts the men and says, ""Our fatherland is France&nbsp;...with me!"" His arguments subdue the crowd, but di Borgo enters the inn, accompanied by gendarmes. Napoleon evades capture and rides away on his horse, pursued by di Borgo and his men. Upstairs in the Ajaccio town hall, a council declares war on France even while the French flag flies outside the window. Napoleon climbs up the balcony and takes down the flag, shouting to the council, ""It is too great for you!"" The men fire their pistols at Napoleon but miss as he rides away. While chasing Napoleon, di Borgo stretches a rope across a road that Napoleon is likely to take. As expected, Napoleon rides toward the rope, but he draws his saber and cuts it down. Napoleon continues at high speed to the shore where he finds a small boat. He abandons the horse and gets into the boat, discovering that it has no oars or sail. He unfurls the French flag from Ajaccio and uses it as a sail. He is drawn out into the open sea. Meanwhile in Paris, meeting in the National Assembly, the majority Girondists are losing to the Montagnards: Robespierre, Danton, Marat and their followers. Robespierre calls for all Girondists to be indicted.  The Girondists seek to flee but are repulsed.  The assembly hall rolls with the struggle between Girondists and Montagnards.  Later, in calm water, the small boat is seen by Lucien and Joseph Buonaparte aboard a French ship, Le Hasard. The larger ship is steered to rescue the unknown boat, and as it is pulled close, Napoleon is recognised, lying unconscious at the bottom, gripping the French flag. Waking, Napoleon directs the ship to a cove in Corsica where the Buonaparte family is rescued. The ship sails for France carrying a future queen, three future kings, and the future Emperor of France. A British warship, the HMS Agamemnon, sights Le Hasard, and a young officer, Horatio Nelson , asks his captain if he might be allowed to shoot at the enemy vessel and sink it. The captain denies the request, saying that the target is too unimportant to waste powder and shot. As Le Hasard sails away, an eagle flies to the Buonapartes and lands on the ship's flag pole.   In July 1793, fanatic Girondist Charlotte Corday  visits Marat in his home and kills him with a knife. Two months later, General Jean François Carteaux , in control of a French army, is ineffectively besieging the port of Toulon, held by 20,000 English, Spanish and Italian troops. Captain Napoleon is assigned to the artillery section and is dismayed by the obvious lack of French discipline. He confronts Carteau"

Like some wild animal, Philip refuses to be penned up. Even more frustrating for his devoted mother and more irritable father, Philip has refused to speak since the age of three. Run Wild, Run Free , directed by Richard C. Sarafian, is occasionally graced with experimental, art film touches, as when, at one point the internal thoughts of Philip's mother  describing her fatigue and inability to love her son can be heard as voice-over as they drive to a therapist appointment. Out roaming the moors, Philip encounters the kindly, nature-loving retired Colonel  who is deeply sympathetic to the boy's plight. Like the nature that surrounds him -- the film was shot on location in Dartmoor, Devon, England -- the boy is a creature of mute-impulse who must be patiently tamed and drawn out just like the animals he encounters. The Colonel introduces Philip to the wonders of the moors: the newly hatched birds whose nests are tucked in tree boughs and the copious bugs crawling under the peat. A world opens up to Philip that expands triple fold when he makes the acquaintance of a wild blue-eyed white colt grazing on the moor. The child forms a deep bond to the animal, a creature that seems to understand him like no other. The experience is transformative, until the horse runs away and Philip becomes distraught. He is distracted by a pet falcon, Lady, given to him by a farm girl neighbour, Diana . Together Philip, the Colonel and Diana train the bird, revelling in its progress and ability to fly to them. When the bird is horribly injured through Philip's carelessness, all of the progress the Colonel has made seems for naught. But the bird recovers, the white horse returns and the Colonel teaches Philip to ride. When Diana and Philip are out riding one night and become lost on the foggy moor, it seems possible that this could be their last adventure amidst the wild forces of nature.""http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/382525%7C382549/Run-Wild-Run-Free.html
284525The Tweedys are a middle-aged couple who run their chicken farm somewhere in Yorkshire, England. Mrs. Tweedy serves as the genius but high-tempered wife of Mr. Tweedy, who is rather slow and timid, but handles his manual work industriously. The coop is run in the style of a World War II POW camp, with the chickens accountable for the number of eggs they lay daily. One chicken, Ginger, who is often treated as the chickens' leader, has attempted numerous plans to flee the coop, aided by contraband smuggled in by two rats, Nick and Fetcher. However, Ginger is routinely captured by Mr. Tweedy and his dogs, and is thrown into a coal bin for solitary confinement numerous times. Ginger is finally released from the coal bin just in time for roll call the next day. Mrs. Tweedy finds on her clipboard that a chicken named Edwina had not laid any eggs. With that, Mrs. Tweedy grabs Edwina and takes her to ""the chop"". Mrs. Tweedy beheads Edwina with a hatchet and cooks her for dinner. Ginger becomes increasingly desperate to find a plan of escape which will work, faces problems with Nick and Fetcher, who are tired of being paid with chicken feed and want eggs instead. Meanwhile, Mrs. Tweedy realizes that the couple's farm is failing, and reads a catalogue on an ambiguous method of increasing profits at the couple's farm. Ginger, realizing something is wrong, attempts to convince herself and the other chickens to speed up their efforts to escape. However, Ginger soon comes to the conclusion that the only escape route is to go over the fence, something Ginger and the other chickens cannot do. Later that same night, as Ginger sits outside, she sees a Rhode Island Red cockerel that seemingly flies over the fence and accidentally crashes into the coop. The other chicken fawn over the new arrival, who introduces himself as Rocky, while Ginger finds the first half of a poster with a picture of Rocky on it; showing it to the other chickens and explaining how Rocky came in, Ginger claims that Rocky can fly. Upon discovering that Rocky is from a circus, Ginger agrees to hide Rocky from his owners if he teaches them how to fly. Rocky reluctantly agrees, but due to injuring his wing as a result of his landing, he cannot show them immediately. Instead, Rocky puts Ginger and the other chickens through a set of exercises that seem to have no purpose while assuring them that all the chickens are making progress. Meanwhile, a large pie-making machine arrives, which Mr. Tweedy begins assembling. At the same time, Mrs. Tweedy orders food rations doubled. Ginger proclaims that their intent is to fatten them up, and then kill them, only for Rocky to drag her off. The two of them argue, Rocky claiming that Ginger's honesty will demoralize the chickens, and Ginger refusing to lie to the other hens. Discovering that the chickens have gone into depression following Ginger's announcement, Rocky organizes a party using a radio obtained by Nick and Fetcher, and he and Ginger grow closer whilst dancing. During the party, Rocky's arm is shown to have healed. Once the pie machine is complete, the Tweedys kidnap Ginger for its first test. Rocky follows Ginger into the machine and eventually rescues her, damaging the machine and giving Rocky and Ginger more time to work on their escape. Fowler, an older cockerel who has been doubting of Rocky's acts, gives him his respect for rescuing Ginger and his old Royal Air Force  badge in tribute. Rocky decides to flee the farm the next day, leaving behind Fowler's medal and the second half of his poster, showing that he was actually a stunt cockerel, only ""flying"" by being shot out of a cannon. This revelation outrages the other chickens, and a fight soon breaks out as morale falls. When Fowler arrives to try and restore order, he begins talking of his days in the RAF, leading Ginger to realize that she and the other chickens can build a plane made from Fowler's pictures and personal recollections. Supplied by Nick and Fetcher, the chickens race against time to assemble their plane as the Tweedys work to repair the pie machine. The chickens finally finish their plane just as Mr. Tweedy unexpectedly completes all the repairs of the pie machine and enters the coop to grab all the chickens. However, the chickens launch an open revolt, tying up and gagging Mr. Tweedy and readying the plane. As the chickens prepare for take-off, Mr. Tweedy ends up freeing himself and knocks down the ramp used to get the plane airborne. Ginger jumps down while Fowler turns the plane around, which knocks Mr. Tweedy unconscious. As Ginger struggles to lift the ramp, Mrs. Tweedy arrives and attempts to kill Ginger with her used hatchet. However, Rocky, having had a change of heart, jumps over the fence aboard his tricycle and hits Mrs. Tweedy in her face, briefly knocking her senseless. Rocky and Ginger grab onto the string of lights caught on the plane's landing gear as the plane takes off, but Mrs. Tweedy soon awakens and also grabs the lights, weighing down the plane. Ginger heads down the string to cut it, but accidentally loses her scissors. Realizing what is the only way left to cut the lights, Ginger manages to trick Mrs. Tweedy into using the hatchet to sever the string, which causes Mrs. Tweedy to fall, crash into the pie machine, and plugging her into the safety valve. This causes the pie machine to build-up pressure and explode in a mushroom cloud of gravy, destroying the barn and covering the entire farm with gravy, leaving only just the barn door standing. The chickens continue to fly to freedom as Mr. Tweedy reminds Mrs. Tweedy: ""I told you they was organized"". Mr. Tweedy later drops the door on top of Mrs. Tweedy before she can lash out on him. In the epilogue, the chickens find their idyllic setting in a bird sanctuary, where they can live in comfort and raise their new chicks. Rocky and Ginger, having fallen in love with each other, become a couple. Meanwhile, Nick and Fetcher discuss their plans of starting their own chicken farm, so they can have all the eggs they could eat. However, Nick and Fetcher ends up arguing with each other over whether the chicken or the egg came first. Their argument ultimately continues during the closing credits and even involves Rocky breaking it up in a post-credits scene.
4024830Preparing to leave for Delhi, Purushan bids his mother goodbye, promising to write to her regularly. In the thinly populated forest area of Wayanad in the north-east of Kerala, the jeep in which he is travelling is stopped by the Police, who take possession of it to carry a dead body found hanging on the wayside tree. The dead man's face looks familiar to Purushan. He becomes restless and is seized with a pathological obsession to find out the identity of the deceased. Against the wishes of his girl friend, he abandons his trip to Delhi and sets out to seek his friends who may have some clue. Purushan meets journalist friends, doctors, and finally a veteran comrade, fondly addressed as Balettan who identifies the dead as the fellow musician who accompanied Satyajit, the guitarist. Satyajit confirms the deceased is his friend Hari, the tabla player. Together they decide to inform Hari's mother who stays in Cochin. They set out on a long eventful journey from the northern highlands of Wayanad to the Southern port city of Cochin. As they move from Calicut to, Beypore, Kodungalloor, Thrissur, Kottapuram, Vypin, and finally to Fort Kochi , the group swells as they meet many mothers and their sons and relatives who have known Hari; some had known him as a tabla player, some as Tony, the jazz drummer and others as a silent political activist, a victim of police brutality, and a loner. And for others he was a drug addict and one who used to drown his sorrow and pain in his music. Through their recollections, Hari's rather diffused identity unfolds. His classmates remember Hari as an introvert, weak and indecisive. His worker comrades identify him as a staunch revolutionary with a strong resistance and will power. But then what went wrong? The colonial past of the places, what they took from us and what they left behind as well as the peoples protests and uprisings, the region witnesses and their heroes and victims are integrated into the narrative, by way of information as well as critiquing. While reporting to his mother about Hari and his friends and their mothers on his southbound journey, John also reconstructs the history of the land through a series of class struggles, student protests, and workers union clashes that took place in the region where Purushan traversed. Starting with the medical students agitation against commercialization of medical education, to a short dialogue with Karuppuswamy, the unfortunate victim who had lost both his legs in a colliery workers struggle for better wages and human dignity, in Kottapuram, to Vypin island where several mazdoors  either died or lost their eyesight in the man-made hooch tragedy, to the Citizens group's forcible taking over of rice and sugar hoarded by unscrupulous black marketer traders and distributing to ordinary people at fair prices and giving back the money collected to the traders, to the manipulated fight between workers of two feuding unions in a Mattanchery street in Fort Kochi, where four fishermen had died, and also some targeted working class leaders in a fake Police encounter, an abortive factory workers strike extending solidarity to the retrenched women workers in Fort Kochi, are some of the long list of peoples protests and struggles reported with deep concern and feeling by Purushan in a long letter to his Mother. As Purushan and his group wait for Hari's mother to come out of the Baptism ceremony from the church, they analyse their own past, note the emerging debate focusing on the romantic evasions and tragic failures of the extremist movement. When Hari s mother finally turns up and faces the youth congregation, she asks ""Suicide wasn't it?"" The film ends with Purushan's mother watching Hari's mother wiping her tear.
10004330During World War II, a Marine battalion prepares to land on a large Japanese-held island in the Pacific. Lieutenant Colonel Gilfillan  warns the men that it will be a tough mission, and that they have been ordered to take prisoners in order to gain information about the Japanese fortifications. Below deck, veteran Lieutenant Carl A. Anderson , a chemistry teacher in civilian life, questions his former student, Corporal Stuart Conroy , who complains that he is ill and cannot fight. Anderson assures him that he has shown courage before and can do so again. In the landing boat heading to shore, Navy corpsman C. E. ""Doc"" Jones  is worried because Anderson has been suffering from ""psychological migraines"" for months. Anderson and his platoon have been fighting since Guadalcanal, and now only seven men remain of the original platoon. Although Doc urged Anderson to seek treatment in the United States, Anderson refuses to leave his men and has been relying on Doc to supply him with painkillers. The men hit the beach and successfully dig in, despite an initial burst of resistance. As four days pass, the seven old timers in Anderson's platoon, including Pigeon Lane , Sergeant Zelenko , Slattery , Coffman , and the unstable ""Pretty Boy"" Riley , grow weary of the constant threat of hidden Japanese snipers. One day, the men try to take a ridge of hills, but are beaten back by Japanese rockets, which come as an unpleasant surprise to the commanding officers. When Coffman  is killed, Anderson is forced to take some more of Doc's pills. Anderson meets with other officers at battalion headquarters, where Gilfillan recounts the troubles they are having capturing prisoners and getting information from them. Sergeant Randolph Johnson , a Japanese linguist who uses psychology in interrogating prisoners, questions a POW who has been dubbed ""Willie."" As Gilfillan receives orders to stop the rockets within nine hours, before the next assault on the hills, Willie informs Johnson that the Japanese soldiers holding a cave stronghold are willing to surrender.

The men capture the remaining Japanese, including a wounded officer, four laborers and a shell-shocked, elderly civilian. Anderson finds a map on the wounded officer. On the return trip, a sniper shoots at Pretty Boy, who kills him during hand-to-hand combat. The confrontation further unbalances him and he attempts to murder the prisoners.

While map expert Lieutenant Butterfield works on a Japanese map overlay found in Pretty Boy's personal effects, Anderson and Johnson learn that one of the POWs is actually an important officer pretending to be a private. From his prideful statements, Johnson deduces where the rockets are located. Anderson learns that Conroy has been killed. Anderson takes the news hard and is ready to give up.

Then, as the film closes, U.S. Corsairs fly in and smash the Japanese position, leading Anderson to scream to his men, ""GIVE 'EM HELL"" whiich they echo in unison.

She attaches her bike to the truck, jumps on top of and fights the men in the truck until they give up. She heads back to Polaris City  where she meets an old childhood friend, Rich Man. Then a flashback occurs, going back to the martial arts training academy when they were little. He is the new head of the police department. He recognizes Lulu, Silver Hawks's name in real life, from magazine covers but does not recall her from his childhood. He tells her of his mission to arrest Silver Hawk. When they arrive at the airport, he asks for her phone number, but she asks for his phone instead. She implants a tracking chip so she can overhear his conversations and agrees to a date if he can recall who she is, tweaking his nose as she goes . At home, she is telling her assistant Mimi about her trip when her adoptive aunt arrives with Professor Ho Chung for a blind date. Prof. Ho starts to tell her of his new project when she gets word of a bank robbery. She suggests going to the movies and leaves to get ready—to change outfits and foil the criminals. The pattern of fighting crooks and disappearing before the police arrive repeats until she arrives at a mugging. This is really a sting for Rich Man to arrest her, but she fends him off and handcuffs him to a pole. As she leaves, he yells that she's leaving without a goodbye. This triggers a flashback to when she left the academy with a monk who would train her further in kung fu, leaving him heartbroken. Back at home, she finds the professor's assistant waiting in his place. The assistant, Kit, escorts her to the professor's demonstration of his project: an A.I. chip that would tap into several databases with information about the user to suggest ways for the user to improve his or her way of life. Lulu doesn't like it because it might infringe on free will. Later, Kit reveals he is a Silver Hawk fan and Man, who is there to provide security, recognizes his ""little sister."" Then the professor is kidnapped by Morris and Jane, with the police and Silver Hawk soon giving chase. At one point, the escape truck is blocked and the two kidnappers get out to slow the pursuit until the truck can move. Silver Hawk battles the two while a camera on his head sends images of her to his boss. The chase ends at an outdoor wedding where she chooses to save the bride instead of following the crooks. While Man investigates Shiraishi Inc., who expressed interest in Ho's chip, Ho is brought before Alexander Wolfe, who wants his chip to take over the minds of the phone's users. He coerces Prof. Ho into helping him. Man's investigation takes him to Zenda City , where Shiraishi is headquartered. His friend on the local force, Lt. Lisa Hayashi, takes him to the CEO, who is already seeing his niece, Lulu Wong. Later, the CEO's daughter Tina is kidnapped by Morris and Jane, and Lulu intervenes. The camera on Morris' head transmits images of Lulu to his boss , who deduces who Silver Hawk is. The crooks escape, and Man brings her to the local police station and asks her about her kung fu skills, which she had earlier denied maintaining. Outside the station, they see the CEO driving away and follow him, knowing that he'd refused to cooperate with police. They tail him to a meeting with Wolfe, who whisks him away in a helicopter before the two can intervene. All Lulu can do is take a picture of Wolfe and later send it to Kit, knowing that he's a fan. Wolfe wants the CEO to put Ho's chip in a new phone and distribute them in exchange for his daughter. Later, he forces Prof. Ho to speed up his preparation of the subliminal messages that phones will transmit, despite possible long-term damage to the user's mind. Ho manages to slip a secret message into the phone's computer code. Days later, Shiraishi is promoting its new phone, and the CEO is more focused on that than on seeing Lulu about his daughter. Lulu goes to her apartment and finds flowers and a message from Wolfe to meet him about Tina. As she's about to leave, she finds Man, who has begun to guess who Silver Hawk is, waiting outside to talk to her. She tells him to wait in the hotel bar, but he leaves some tracking chips on top of the door. when she leaves, the chips fall onto her hair, and he tracks her to her meeting. Inside the building, she meets Wolfe, who then sends four men attached to bungee cords to attack Silver Hawk and leap away before she can respond. She manages to fend them off until Wolfe injures her shoulder with his prosthetic arms. She then uses one bungee cord to leap up to a window and escape. Man tracks her to where she'd passed out from the pain and takes her to his apartment to confront her about her vigilante actions. This is interrupted when Kit walks in and start to blab about the e-mail he'd sent her about Wolfe. Man drags him away to get the information about Wolfe. That interrogation is interrupted by a newsflash about the CEO's support of Wolfe to run for premier. Kit sees how unnatural the CEO's face is; Man sees he's wearing a new phone. The two investigate the connection. As Lulu bathes to heal her shoulder, she recalls a lesson her teacher gave her about the nature of water and kung fu. This gives her an idea on how to deal with Wolfe. The next day, Kit has discovered the secret message Prof. Ho put in the code. Wolfe plans to activate the mind control in a few hours, but they don't know where to look for him until Silver Hawk sends them the address. There, the police battle Wolfe's thugs until Silver Hawk arrives to help put them away. Kit finds a way to Wolfe's lair and then tend to Prof. Ho while Silver Hawk and Man battle Wolfe and his men.

196923The scenario of the film as originally written by Gance was published in 1927 by Librairie Plon. Much of the scenario describes scenes that were rejected during initial editing, and do not appear in any known version of the film. The following plot includes only those scenes that are known to have been included in some version of the film. Not every scene described below can be viewed today.Brownlow 1983, p. 264   In the winter of 1779–1780, ten-year-old Napoleon Buonaparte  is enrolled at Brienne College, a military school for sons of nobility, run by the religious Minim Fathers in Brienne-le-Château, France. The boys at the school are holding a snowball fight organised as a battlefield. Two bullies—Philippeaux  and Peccaduc —schoolyard antagonists of Napoleon, are leading the larger side, outnumbering the side that Napoleon fights for. These two sneak up on Napoleon with snowballs enclosing stones. A hardened snowball draws blood on Napoleon's face. Napoleon is warned of another rock-snowball by a shout from Tristan Fleuri , the school's scullion and a friend to Napoleon. Napoleon recovers himself and dashes alone to the enemy snowbank to engage the two bullies in close combat. The Minim Fathers, watching the snowball fight from windows and doorways, applaud the action. Napoleon returns to his troops and encourages them to attack ferociously. He watches keenly and calmly as this attack progresses, assessing the balance of the struggle and giving appropriate orders. He smiles as his troops turn the tide of battle. Carrying his side's flag, he leads his forces in a final charge and raises the flag at the enemy stronghold. The monks come out of the school buildings to discover who led the victory. A young military instructor, Jean-Charles Pichegru , asks Napoleon for his name. Napoleon responds ""Nap-eye-ony"" in Corsican-accented French, and is laughed at by the others. Pichegru tells him that he will go far. In class, the boys study geography. Napoleon is angered by the condescending textbook description of Corsica. He is taunted by the other boys, and kicked by the two bullies who hold flanking seats. Another of the class's island examples is Saint Helena, which puts Napoleon into a pensive daydream. Unhappy in school, Napoleon writes about his difficulties in a letter to his family. A bully reports to a monk that Napoleon is hiding letters in his bed, and the monk tears the letter to pieces. Angry, Napoleon goes to visit the attic quarters of his friend Fleuri, a place of refuge where Napoleon keeps his captive bird, a young eagle that was sent to him from Corsica by an uncle. Napoleon tenderly pets the eagle's head, then leaves to fetch water for the bird. The two bullies take this opportunity to set the bird free. Napoleon finds the bird gone and runs to the dormitory to demand the culprit show himself. None of the boys admits to the deed. Napoleon exclaims that they are all guilty, and begins to fight them all, jumping from bed to bed. In the clash, pillows are split and feathers fly through the air as the Minim Fathers work to restore order. They collar Napoleon and throw him outside in the snow. Napoleon cries to himself on the limber of a cannon, then he looks up to see the young eagle in a tree. He calls to the eagle which flies down to the cannon barrel. Napoleon caresses the eagle and smiles through his tears.  In 1792, the great hall of the Club of the Cordeliers is filled with revolutionary zeal as hundreds of members wait for a meeting to begin. The leaders of the group, Georges Danton , Jean-Paul Marat  and Maximilien Robespierre , are seen conferring. Camille Desmoulins , Danton's secretary, interrupts Danton to tell of a new song that has been printed, called ""La Marseillaise"". A young army captain, Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle  has written the words and brought the song to the club. Danton directs de Lisle to sing the song to the club. The sheet music is distributed and the club learns to sing the song, rising in fervor with each passage. At the edge of the crowd, Napoleon , now a young army lieutenant, thanks de Lisle as he leaves: ""Your hymn will save many a cannon."" Splashed with water in a narrow Paris street, Napoleon is noticed by Joséphine de Beauharnais  and Paul Barras  as they step from a carriage on their way into the house of Mademoiselle Lenormand , the fortune teller. Inside, Lenormand exclaims to Joséphine that she has the amazing fortune to be the future queen. On the night of 10 August 1792, Napoleon watches impassively as mob rule takes over Paris and a man is hung by revolutionaries. In front of the National Assembly, Danton tells the crowd that they have cracked the monarchy. Napoleon senses a purpose rising within him, to bring order to the chaos. The mob violence has tempered his character. Napoleon, on leave from the French Army, travels to Corsica with his sister, Élisa . They are greeted by his mother, Letizia Buonaparte  and the rest of his family at their summer home in Les Milelli. The shepherd Santo-Ricci  interrupts the happy welcome to tell Napoleon the bad news that Corsica's president, Pasquale Paoli  is planning to give the island to the British. Napoleon declares his intention to prevent this fate. Riding a horse and revisiting places of his childhood, Napoleon stops in Milelli gardens and considers whether to retreat and protect his family, or to advance into the political arena. Later in the streets of Ajaccio, Pozzo di Borgo  encourages a mob to put Napoleon to death for opposing Paoli, and the townsfolk surround the Buonaparte home. Napoleon stands outside the door and stares the crowd down, dispersing them silently. Paoli signs a death warrant, putting a price on Napoleon's head. Napoleon's brothers, Lucien  and Joseph , leave for Calvi to see if French authorities can intervene. Napoleon faces the danger alone, walking into an inn where men are arguing politics, all of whom would like to see him dead. He confronts the men and says, ""Our fatherland is France&nbsp;...with me!"" His arguments subdue the crowd, but di Borgo enters the inn, accompanied by gendarmes. Napoleon evades capture and rides away on his horse, pursued by di Borgo and his men. Upstairs in the Ajaccio town hall, a council declares war on France even while the French flag flies outside the window. Napoleon climbs up the balcony and takes down the flag, shouting to the council, ""It is too great for you!"" The men fire their pistols at Napoleon but miss as he rides away. While chasing Napoleon, di Borgo stretches a rope across a road that Napoleon is likely to take. As expected, Napoleon rides toward the rope, but he draws his saber and cuts it down. Napoleon continues at high speed to the shore where he finds a small boat. He abandons the horse and gets into the boat, discovering that it has no oars or sail. He unfurls the French flag from Ajaccio and uses it as a sail. He is drawn out into the open sea. Meanwhile in Paris, meeting in the National Assembly, the majority Girondists are losing to the Montagnards: Robespierre, Danton, Marat and their followers. Robespierre calls for all Girondists to be indicted.  The Girondists seek to flee but are repulsed.  The assembly hall rolls with the struggle between Girondists and Montagnards.  Later, in calm water, the small boat is seen by Lucien and Joseph Buonaparte aboard a French ship, Le Hasard. The larger ship is steered to rescue the unknown boat, and as it is pulled close, Napoleon is recognised, lying unconscious at the bottom, gripping the French flag. Waking, Napoleon directs the ship to a cove in Corsica where the Buonaparte family is rescued. The ship sails for France carrying a future queen, three future kings, and the future Emperor of France. A British warship, the HMS Agamemnon, sights Le Hasard, and a young officer, Horatio Nelson , asks his captain if he might be allowed to shoot at the enemy vessel and sink it. The captain denies the request, saying that the target is too unimportant to waste powder and shot. As Le Hasard sails away, an eagle flies to the Buonapartes and lands on the ship's flag pole.   In July 1793, fanatic Girondist Charlotte Corday  visits Marat in his home and kills him with a knife. Two months later, General Jean François Carteaux , in control of a French army, is ineffectively besieging the port of Toulon, held by 20,000 English, Spanish and Italian troops. Captain Napoleon is assigned to the artillery section and is dismayed by the obvious lack of French discipline. He confronts Carteau"

Like some wild animal, Philip refuses to be penned up. Even more frustrating for his devoted mother and more irritable father, Philip has refused to speak since the age of three. Run Wild, Run Free , directed by Richard C. Sarafian, is occasionally graced with experimental, art film touches, as when, at one point the internal thoughts of Philip's mother  describing her fatigue and inability to love her son can be heard as voice-over as they drive to a therapist appointment. Out roaming the moors, Philip encounters the kindly, nature-loving retired Colonel  who is deeply sympathetic to the boy's plight. Like the nature that surrounds him -- the film was shot on location in Dartmoor, Devon, England -- the boy is a creature of mute-impulse who must be patiently tamed and drawn out just like the animals he encounters. The Colonel introduces Philip to the wonders of the moors: the newly hatched birds whose nests are tucked in tree boughs and the copious bugs crawling under the peat. A world opens up to Philip that expands triple fold when he makes the acquaintance of a wild blue-eyed white colt grazing on the moor. The child forms a deep bond to the animal, a creature that seems to understand him like no other. The experience is transformative, until the horse runs away and Philip becomes distraught. He is distracted by a pet falcon, Lady, given to him by a farm girl neighbour, Diana . Together Philip, the Colonel and Diana train the bird, revelling in its progress and ability to fly to them. When the bird is horribly injured through Philip's carelessness, all of the progress the Colonel has made seems for naught. But the bird recovers, the white horse returns and the Colonel teaches Philip to ride. When Diana and Philip are out riding one night and become lost on the foggy moor, it seems possible that this could be their last adventure amidst the wild forces of nature.""http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/382525%7C382549/Run-Wild-Run-Free.html
284525The Tweedys are a middle-aged couple who run their chicken farm somewhere in Yorkshire, England. Mrs. Tweedy serves as the genius but high-tempered wife of Mr. Tweedy, who is rather slow and timid, but handles his manual work industriously. The coop is run in the style of a World War II POW camp, with the chickens accountable for the number of eggs they lay daily. One chicken, Ginger, who is often treated as the chickens' leader, has attempted numerous plans to flee the coop, aided by contraband smuggled in by two rats, Nick and Fetcher. However, Ginger is routinely captured by Mr. Tweedy and his dogs, and is thrown into a coal bin for solitary confinement numerous times. Ginger is finally released from the coal bin just in time for roll call the next day. Mrs. Tweedy finds on her clipboard that a chicken named Edwina had not laid any eggs. With that, Mrs. Tweedy grabs Edwina and takes her to ""the chop"". Mrs. Tweedy beheads Edwina with a hatchet and cooks her for dinner. Ginger becomes increasingly desperate to find a plan of escape which will work, faces problems with Nick and Fetcher, who are tired of being paid with chicken feed and want eggs instead. Meanwhile, Mrs. Tweedy realizes that the couple's farm is failing, and reads a catalogue on an ambiguous method of increasing profits at the couple's farm. Ginger, realizing something is wrong, attempts to convince herself and the other chickens to speed up their efforts to escape. However, Ginger soon comes to the conclusion that the only escape route is to go over the fence, something Ginger and the other chickens cannot do. Later that same night, as Ginger sits outside, she sees a Rhode Island Red cockerel that seemingly flies over the fence and accidentally crashes into the coop. The other chicken fawn over the new arrival, who introduces himself as Rocky, while Ginger finds the first half of a poster with a picture of Rocky on it; showing it to the other chickens and explaining how Rocky came in, Ginger claims that Rocky can fly. Upon discovering that Rocky is from a circus, Ginger agrees to hide Rocky from his owners if he teaches them how to fly. Rocky reluctantly agrees, but due to injuring his wing as a result of his landing, he cannot show them immediately. Instead, Rocky puts Ginger and the other chickens through a set of exercises that seem to have no purpose while assuring them that all the chickens are making progress. Meanwhile, a large pie-making machine arrives, which Mr. Tweedy begins assembling. At the same time, Mrs. Tweedy orders food rations doubled. Ginger proclaims that their intent is to fatten them up, and then kill them, only for Rocky to drag her off. The two of them argue, Rocky claiming that Ginger's honesty will demoralize the chickens, and Ginger refusing to lie to the other hens. Discovering that the chickens have gone into depression following Ginger's announcement, Rocky organizes a party using a radio obtained by Nick and Fetcher, and he and Ginger grow closer whilst dancing. During the party, Rocky's arm is shown to have healed. Once the pie machine is complete, the Tweedys kidnap Ginger for its first test. Rocky follows Ginger into the machine and eventually rescues her, damaging the machine and giving Rocky and Ginger more time to work on their escape. Fowler, an older cockerel who has been doubting of Rocky's acts, gives him his respect for rescuing Ginger and his old Royal Air Force  badge in tribute. Rocky decides to flee the farm the next day, leaving behind Fowler's medal and the second half of his poster, showing that he was actually a stunt cockerel, only ""flying"" by being shot out of a cannon. This revelation outrages the other chickens, and a fight soon breaks out as morale falls. When Fowler arrives to try and restore order, he begins talking of his days in the RAF, leading Ginger to realize that she and the other chickens can build a plane made from Fowler's pictures and personal recollections. Supplied by Nick and Fetcher, the chickens race against time to assemble their plane as the Tweedys work to repair the pie machine. The chickens finally finish their plane just as Mr. Tweedy unexpectedly completes all the repairs of the pie machine and enters the coop to grab all the chickens. However, the chickens launch an open revolt, tying up and gagging Mr. Tweedy and readying the plane. As the chickens prepare for take-off, Mr. Tweedy ends up freeing himself and knocks down the ramp used to get the plane airborne. Ginger jumps down while Fowler turns the plane around, which knocks Mr. Tweedy unconscious. As Ginger struggles to lift the ramp, Mrs. Tweedy arrives and attempts to kill Ginger with her used hatchet. However, Rocky, having had a change of heart, jumps over the fence aboard his tricycle and hits Mrs. Tweedy in her face, briefly knocking her senseless. Rocky and Ginger grab onto the string of lights caught on the plane's landing gear as the plane takes off, but Mrs. Tweedy soon awakens and also grabs the lights, weighing down the plane. Ginger heads down the string to cut it, but accidentally loses her scissors. Realizing what is the only way left to cut the lights, Ginger manages to trick Mrs. Tweedy into using the hatchet to sever the string, which causes Mrs. Tweedy to fall, crash into the pie machine, and plugging her into the safety valve. This causes the pie machine to build-up pressure and explode in a mushroom cloud of gravy, destroying the barn and covering the entire farm with gravy, leaving only just the barn door standing. The chickens continue to fly to freedom as Mr. Tweedy reminds Mrs. Tweedy: ""I told you they was organized"". Mr. Tweedy later drops the door on top of Mrs. Tweedy before she can lash out on him. In the epilogue, the chickens find their idyllic setting in a bird sanctuary, where they can live in comfort and raise their new chicks. Rocky and Ginger, having fallen in love with each other, become a couple. Meanwhile, Nick and Fetcher discuss their plans of starting their own chicken farm, so they can have all the eggs they could eat. However, Nick and Fetcher ends up arguing with each other over whether the chicken or the egg came first. Their argument ultimately continues during the closing credits and even involves Rocky breaking it up in a post-credits scene.
4024830Preparing to leave for Delhi, Purushan bids his mother goodbye, promising to write to her regularly. In the thinly populated forest area of Wayanad in the north-east of Kerala, the jeep in which he is travelling is stopped by the Police, who take possession of it to carry a dead body found hanging on the wayside tree. The dead man's face looks familiar to Purushan. He becomes restless and is seized with a pathological obsession to find out the identity of the deceased. Against the wishes of his girl friend, he abandons his trip to Delhi and sets out to seek his friends who may have some clue. Purushan meets journalist friends, doctors, and finally a veteran comrade, fondly addressed as Balettan who identifies the dead as the fellow musician who accompanied Satyajit, the guitarist. Satyajit confirms the deceased is his friend Hari, the tabla player. Together they decide to inform Hari's mother who stays in Cochin. They set out on a long eventful journey from the northern highlands of Wayanad to the Southern port city of Cochin. As they move from Calicut to, Beypore, Kodungalloor, Thrissur, Kottapuram, Vypin, and finally to Fort Kochi , the group swells as they meet many mothers and their sons and relatives who have known Hari; some had known him as a tabla player, some as Tony, the jazz drummer and others as a silent political activist, a victim of police brutality, and a loner. And for others he was a drug addict and one who used to drown his sorrow and pain in his music. Through their recollections, Hari's rather diffused identity unfolds. His classmates remember Hari as an introvert, weak and indecisive. His worker comrades identify him as a staunch revolutionary with a strong resistance and will power. But then what went wrong? The colonial past of the places, what they took from us and what they left behind as well as the peoples protests and uprisings, the region witnesses and their heroes and victims are integrated into the narrative, by way of information as well as critiquing. While reporting to his mother about Hari and his friends and their mothers on his southbound journey, John also reconstructs the history of the land through a series of class struggles, student protests, and workers union clashes that took place in the region where Purushan traversed. Starting with the medical students agitation against commercialization of medical education, to a short dialogue with Karuppuswamy, the unfortunate victim who had lost both his legs in a colliery workers struggle for better wages and human dignity, in Kottapuram, to Vypin island where several mazdoors  either died or lost their eyesight in the man-made hooch tragedy, to the Citizens group's forcible taking over of rice and sugar hoarded by unscrupulous black marketer traders and distributing to ordinary people at fair prices and giving back the money collected to the traders, to the manipulated fight between workers of two feuding unions in a Mattanchery street in Fort Kochi, where four fishermen had died, and also some targeted working class leaders in a fake Police encounter, an abortive factory workers strike extending solidarity to the retrenched women workers in Fort Kochi, are some of the long list of peoples protests and struggles reported with deep concern and feeling by Purushan in a long letter to his Mother. As Purushan and his group wait for Hari's mother to come out of the Baptism ceremony from the church, they analyse their own past, note the emerging debate focusing on the romantic evasions and tragic failures of the extremist movement. When Hari s mother finally turns up and faces the youth congregation, she asks ""Suicide wasn't it?"" The film ends with Purushan's mother watching Hari's mother wiping her tear.
10004330During World War II, a Marine battalion prepares to land on a large Japanese-held island in the Pacific. Lieutenant Colonel Gilfillan  warns the men that it will be a tough mission, and that they have been ordered to take prisoners in order to gain information about the Japanese fortifications. Below deck, veteran Lieutenant Carl A. Anderson , a chemistry teacher in civilian life, questions his former student, Corporal Stuart Conroy , who complains that he is ill and cannot fight. Anderson assures him that he has shown courage before and can do so again. In the landing boat heading to shore, Navy corpsman C. E. ""Doc"" Jones  is worried because Anderson has been suffering from ""psychological migraines"" for months. Anderson and his platoon have been fighting since Guadalcanal, and now only seven men remain of the original platoon. Although Doc urged Anderson to seek treatment in the United States, Anderson refuses to leave his men and has been relying on Doc to supply him with painkillers. The men hit the beach and successfully dig in, despite an initial burst of resistance. As four days pass, the seven old timers in Anderson's platoon, including Pigeon Lane , Sergeant Zelenko , Slattery , Coffman , and the unstable ""Pretty Boy"" Riley , grow weary of the constant threat of hidden Japanese snipers. One day, the men try to take a ridge of hills, but are beaten back by Japanese rockets, which come as an unpleasant surprise to the commanding officers. When Coffman  is killed, Anderson is forced to take some more of Doc's pills. Anderson meets with other officers at battalion headquarters, where Gilfillan recounts the troubles they are having capturing prisoners and getting information from them. Sergeant Randolph Johnson , a Japanese linguist who uses psychology in interrogating prisoners, questions a POW who has been dubbed ""Willie."" As Gilfillan receives orders to stop the rockets within nine hours, before the next assault on the hills, Willie informs Johnson that the Japanese soldiers holding a cave stronghold are willing to surrender. Accompanied by Johnson and war correspondent Sergeant Dickerman , Anderson leads a patrol to the cave, but they are ambushed and Zelenko is blinded. The men capture the remaining Japanese, including a wounded officer, four laborers and a shell-shocked, elderly civilian. Anderson finds a map on the wounded officer. On the return trip, a sniper shoots at Pretty Boy, who kills him during hand-to-hand combat. The confrontation further unbalances him and he attempts to murder the prisoners. Lane then accidentally shoots and kills Pretty Boy while attempting to stop him. Doc also dies, but not before giving Dickerman a message for Anderson. Anderson takes his prisoners to headquarters, where the wounded officer commits hara-kiri with a knife he had stolen from Johnson. While map expert Lieutenant Butterfield works on a Japanese map overlay found in Pretty Boy's personal effects, Anderson and Johnson learn that one of the POWs is actually an important officer pretending to be a private. From his prideful statements, Johnson deduces where the rockets are located. Anderson learns that Conroy has been killed. Anderson takes the news hard and is ready to give up. Dickerman reads aloud Doc's note, however, and Anderson, inspired by Doc's appeal for him to be strong for the sake of those whom he survives, throws away his painkillers and again leads his men into battle. Then, as the film closes, U.S. Corsairs fly in and smash the Japanese position, leading Anderson to scream to his men, ""GIVE 'EM HELL"" whiich they echo in unison.

After they leave, Hannah says good bye and goes home.

Once at Scary Godmother's house, everyone starts to dance and have fun, except for Jimmy, who steals the prize for scariest costume.

Upon seeing that he scared Bug a Boo, Scary Godmother announces that Jimmy is the winner, and gives him the prize, restoring his face to normal. Upon the end of the special, we once again see Harry in the control room. Now, he's trying to persuade the audience to give him spare candy.

Then a flashback occurs, going back to the martial arts training academy when they were little. He is the new head of the police department. He recognizes Lulu, Silver Hawks's name in real life, from magazine covers but does not recall her from his childhood. He tells her of his mission to arrest Silver Hawk. When they arrive at the airport, he asks for her phone number, but she asks for his phone instead. She implants a tracking chip so she can overhear his conversations and agrees to a date if he can recall who she is, tweaking his nose as she goes . At home, she is telling her assistant Mimi about her trip when her adoptive aunt arrives with Professor Ho Chung for a blind date. Prof. Ho starts to tell her of his new project when she gets word of a bank robbery. She suggests going to the movies and leaves to get ready—to change outfits and foil the criminals. The pattern of fighting crooks and disappearing before the police arrive repeats until she arrives at a mugging. This is really a sting for Rich Man to arrest her, but she fends him off and handcuffs him to a pole. As she leaves, he yells that she's leaving without a goodbye. This triggers a flashback to when she left the academy with a monk who would train her further in kung fu, leaving him heartbroken. Back at home, she finds the professor's assistant waiting in his place. The assistant, Kit, escorts her to the professor's demonstration of his project: an A.I. chip that would tap into several databases with information about the user to suggest ways for the user to improve his or her way of life. Lulu doesn't like it because it might infringe on free will. Later, Kit reveals he is a Silver Hawk fan and Man, who is there to provide security, recognizes his ""little sister.""

Lisa Hayashi, takes him to the CEO, who is already seeing his niece, Lulu Wong. Later, the CEO's daughter Tina is kidnapped by Morris and Jane, and Lulu intervenes.

Wolfe wants the CEO to put Ho's chip in a new phone and distribute them in exchange for his daughter. Later, he forces Prof. Ho to speed up his preparation of the subliminal messages that phones will transmit, despite possible long-term damage to the user's mind. Ho manages to slip a secret message into the phone's computer code. Days later, Shiraishi is promoting its new phone, and the CEO is more focused on that than on seeing Lulu about his daughter. Lulu goes to her apartment and finds flowers and a message from Wolfe to meet him about Tina. As she's about to leave, she finds Man, who has begun to guess who Silver Hawk is, waiting outside to talk to her. She tells him to wait in the hotel bar, but he leaves some tracking chips on top of the door. when she leaves, the chips fall onto her hair, and he tracks her to her meeting. Inside the building, she meets Wolfe, who then sends four men attached to bungee cords to attack Silver Hawk and leap away before she can respond. She manages to fend them off until Wolfe injures her shoulder with his prosthetic arms. She then uses one bungee cord to leap up to a window and escape. Man tracks her to where she'd passed out from the pain and takes her to his apartment to confront her about her vigilante actions. This is interrupted when Kit walks in and start to blab about the e-mail he'd sent her about Wolfe. Man drags him away to get the information about Wolfe. That interrogation is interrupted by a newsflash about the CEO's support of Wolfe to run for premier. Kit sees how unnatural the CEO's face is; Man sees he's wearing a new phone. The two investigate the connection. As Lulu bathes to heal her shoulder, she recalls a lesson her teacher gave her about the nature of water and kung fu. This gives her an idea on how to deal with Wolfe. The next day, Kit has discovered the secret message Prof. Ho put in the code. Wolfe plans to activate the mind control in a few hours, but they don't know where to look for him until Silver Hawk sends them the address. There, the police battle Wolfe's thugs until Silver Hawk arrives to help put them away. Kit finds a way to Wolfe's lair and then tend to Prof. Ho while Silver Hawk and Man battle Wolfe and his men. She uses cloths attached to her flying blades to subdue his prosthetics, and she and Man finally defeat him. But they must use Wolfe's retinal scan to stop the process, so Kit tricks him into opening his eyes. This foils his plan but also activates the self-destruct system. Silver Hawk and the rest escape, but Wolfe is crushed to death. Back in Polaris City, Lulu has a date with Man. He's called away on official business, leaving the question of whether he'd arrest Lulu unanswered. Silver Hawk later drives up next to man, and the two tease each other about their signature moves.

196923The scenario of the film as originally written by Gance was published in 1927 by Librairie Plon. Much of the scenario describes scenes that were rejected during initial editing, and do not appear in any known version of the film. The following plot includes only those scenes that are known to have been included in some version of the film. Not every scene described below can be viewed today.Brownlow 1983, p. 264   In the winter of 1779–1780, ten-year-old Napoleon Buonaparte  is enrolled at Brienne College, a military school for sons of nobility, run by the religious Minim Fathers in Brienne-le-Château, France. The boys at the school are holding a snowball fight organised as a battlefield. Two bullies—Philippeaux  and Peccaduc —schoolyard antagonists of Napoleon, are leading the larger side, outnumbering the side that Napoleon fights for. These two sneak up on Napoleon with snowballs enclosing stones. A hardened snowball draws blood on Napoleon's face. Napoleon is warned of another rock-snowball by a shout from Tristan Fleuri , the school's scullion and a friend to Napoleon. Napoleon recovers himself and dashes alone to the enemy snowbank to engage the two bullies in close combat. The Minim Fathers, watching the snowball fight from windows and doorways, applaud the action. Napoleon returns to his troops and encourages them to attack ferociously. He watches keenly and calmly as this attack progresses, assessing the balance of the struggle and giving appropriate orders. He smiles as his troops turn the tide of battle. Carrying his side's flag, he leads his forces in a final charge and raises the flag at the enemy stronghold. The monks come out of the school buildings to discover who led the victory. A young military instructor, Jean-Charles Pichegru , asks Napoleon for his name. Napoleon responds ""Nap-eye-ony"" in Corsican-accented French, and is laughed at by the others. Pichegru tells him that he will go far. In class, the boys study geography. Napoleon is angered by the condescending textbook description of Corsica. He is taunted by the other boys, and kicked by the two bullies who hold flanking seats. Another of the class's island examples is Saint Helena, which puts Napoleon into a pensive daydream. Unhappy in school, Napoleon writes about his difficulties in a letter to his family. A bully reports to a monk that Napoleon is hiding letters in his bed, and the monk tears the letter to pieces. Angry, Napoleon goes to visit the attic quarters of his friend Fleuri, a place of refuge where Napoleon keeps his captive bird, a young eagle that was sent to him from Corsica by an uncle. Napoleon tenderly pets the eagle's head, then leaves to fetch water for the bird. The two bullies take this opportunity to set the bird free. Napoleon finds the bird gone and runs to the dormitory to demand the culprit show himself. None of the boys admits to the deed. Napoleon exclaims that they are all guilty, and begins to fight them all, jumping from bed to bed. In the clash, pillows are split and feathers fly through the air as the Minim Fathers work to restore order. They collar Napoleon and throw him outside in the snow. Napoleon cries to himself on the limber of a cannon, then he looks up to see the young eagle in a tree. He calls to the eagle which flies down to the cannon barrel. Napoleon caresses the eagle and smiles through his tears.  In 1792, the great hall of the Club of the Cordeliers is filled with revolutionary zeal as hundreds of members wait for a meeting to begin. The leaders of the group, Georges Danton , Jean-Paul Marat  and Maximilien Robespierre , are seen conferring. Camille Desmoulins , Danton's secretary, interrupts Danton to tell of a new song that has been printed, called ""La Marseillaise"". A young army captain, Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle  has written the words and brought the song to the club. Danton directs de Lisle to sing the song to the club. The sheet music is distributed and the club learns to sing the song, rising in fervor with each passage. At the edge of the crowd, Napoleon , now a young army lieutenant, thanks de Lisle as he leaves: ""Your hymn will save many a cannon."" Splashed with water in a narrow Paris street, Napoleon is noticed by Joséphine de Beauharnais  and Paul Barras  as they step from a carriage on their way into the house of Mademoiselle Lenormand , the fortune teller. Inside, Lenormand exclaims to Joséphine that she has the amazing fortune to be the future queen. On the night of 10 August 1792, Napoleon watches impassively as mob rule takes over Paris and a man is hung by revolutionaries. In front of the National Assembly, Danton tells the crowd that they have cracked the monarchy. Napoleon senses a purpose rising within him, to bring order to the chaos. The mob violence has tempered his character. Napoleon, on leave from the French Army, travels to Corsica with his sister, Élisa . They are greeted by his mother, Letizia Buonaparte  and the rest of his family at their summer home in Les Milelli. The shepherd Santo-Ricci  interrupts the happy welcome to tell Napoleon the bad news that Corsica's president, Pasquale Paoli  is planning to give the island to the British. Napoleon declares his intention to prevent this fate. Riding a horse and revisiting places of his childhood, Napoleon stops in Milelli gardens and considers whether to retreat and protect his family, or to advance into the political arena. Later in the streets of Ajaccio, Pozzo di Borgo  encourages a mob to put Napoleon to death for opposing Paoli, and the townsfolk surround the Buonaparte home. Napoleon stands outside the door and stares the crowd down, dispersing them silently. Paoli signs a death warrant, putting a price on Napoleon's head. Napoleon's brothers, Lucien  and Joseph , leave for Calvi to see if French authorities can intervene. Napoleon faces the danger alone, walking into an inn where men are arguing politics, all of whom would like to see him dead. He confronts the men and says, ""Our fatherland is France&nbsp;...with me!"" His arguments subdue the crowd, but di Borgo enters the inn, accompanied by gendarmes. Napoleon evades capture and rides away on his horse, pursued by di Borgo and his men. Upstairs in the Ajaccio town hall, a council declares war on France even while the French flag flies outside the window. Napoleon climbs up the balcony and takes down the flag, shouting to the council, ""It is too great for you!"" The men fire their pistols at Napoleon but miss as he rides away. While chasing Napoleon, di Borgo stretches a rope across a road that Napoleon is likely to take. As expected, Napoleon rides toward the rope, but he draws his saber and cuts it down. Napoleon continues at high speed to the shore where he finds a small boat. He abandons the horse and gets into the boat, discovering that it has no oars or sail. He unfurls the French flag from Ajaccio and uses it as a sail. He is drawn out into the open sea. Meanwhile in Paris, meeting in the National Assembly, the majority Girondists are losing to the Montagnards: Robespierre, Danton, Marat and their followers. Robespierre calls for all Girondists to be indicted.  The Girondists seek to flee but are repulsed.  The assembly hall rolls with the struggle between Girondists and Montagnards.  Later, in calm water, the small boat is seen by Lucien and Joseph Buonaparte aboard a French ship, Le Hasard. The larger ship is steered to rescue the unknown boat, and as it is pulled close, Napoleon is recognised, lying unconscious at the bottom, gripping the French flag. Waking, Napoleon directs the ship to a cove in Corsica where the Buonaparte family is rescued. The ship sails for France carrying a future queen, three future kings, and the future Emperor of France. A British warship, the HMS Agamemnon, sights Le Hasard, and a young officer, Horatio Nelson , asks his captain if he might be allowed to shoot at the enemy vessel and sink it. The captain denies the request, saying that the target is too unimportant to waste powder and shot. As Le Hasard sails away, an eagle flies to the Buonapartes and lands on the ship's flag pole.   In July 1793, fanatic Girondist Charlotte Corday  visits Marat in his home and kills him with a knife. Two months later, General Jean François Carteaux , in control of a French army, is ineffectively besieging the port of Toulon, held by 20,000 English, Spanish and Italian troops. Captain Napoleon is assigned to the artillery section and is dismayed by the obvious lack of French discipline. He confronts Carteau"

He was Rachel's firstborn and Israel's eleventh son. Of all the sons, Joseph was loved by his father the most. Israel even arrayed Joseph with a ""long coat of many colors"".Another possible translation is ""coat with long sleeves"" - see ""A Dictionary of the Targumim, Talmud Bavli, Talmud Yerushalmi and Midrashic Literature"", 1903. ISBN 1-932443-20-7 Israel's favoritism toward Joseph caused his half brothers to hate him, and when Joseph was seventeen years old he had two dreams that made his brothers plot his demise. In the first dream, Joseph and his brothers gathered bundles of grain. Then, all of the grain bundles that had been prepared by the brothers gathered around Joseph's bundle and bowed down to it. In the second dream, the sun , the moon  and eleven stars  bowed down to Joseph himself. When he told these two dreams to his brothers, they despised him for the implications that the family would be bowing down to Joseph. They became jealous that their father would even ponder over Joseph's words concerning these dreams.  They saw their chance when they were feeding the flocks, the brothers saw Joseph from afar and plotted to kill him. They turned on him and stripped him of the coat his father made for him, and threw him into a pit. As they pondered what to do with Joseph, the brothers saw a camel caravan of Ishmaelites coming out of Gilead, carrying spices and perfumes to Egypt, for trade. Judah, the strongest, thought twice about killing Joseph and proposed that he be sold. The traders paid twenty pieces of silver for Joseph, and the brothers took Joseph's coat back to Jacob, who assumed Joseph had been killed by wild animals.  The text of the biblical story is muddled over who sold Joseph into slavery - which of the brothers, Reuben or Judah, and whether he was sold to Midianite traders or Ishmaelite traders. What is clear is that Joseph was sold to serve Potiphar, the captain of Pharaoh's guard.{{bibleverse}}, {{bibleverse}} While serving in Potiphar's household, Yahweh was with Joseph so that he prospered in everything he did. Joseph found favor in the sight of Potiphar and so he became his personal servant. Then Joseph was promoted to oversee Potiphar's entire household as a superintendent. After some time, Potiphar's wife began to desire Joseph and sought to have an affair with him. Despite her persistence, he refused to have sex with her for fear of sinning against God. After some days of begging for him, she grabbed him by his cloak, but he escaped from her leaving his garment behind. Angered by his running away from her, she took his garment and made a false claim against him by charging that he tried have sex with her. This resulted in Joseph being thrown into prison.Josephus claims that Potiphar basically fell for his wife's crocodile tears even though he couldn't believe that Joseph was capable of ""making sport"" of his wife. - Josephus. The Antiquities of the Jews, Book II, 4.1-5   The warden put Joseph in charge of the other prisoners,{{bibleverse}} and soon afterward Pharaoh's chief cup bearer and chief baker, who had offended the Pharaoh, were thrown into the prison.{{bibleverse}} They both had dreams, and they asked Joseph to help interpret them. The chief cup bearer had held a vine in his hand, with three branches that brought forth grapes; he took them to Pharoah and put them in his cup. The chief baker had three baskets of bread on his head, intended for Pharoah, but some birds came along and ate the bread. Joseph told them that within three days the chief cup bearer would be reinstated but the chief baker would be hanged.{{bibleverse}} Joseph requested the cup bearer to mention him to Pharaoh and secure his release from prison,{{bibleverse}} but the cup bearer, reinstalled in office, forgot Joseph.{{bibleverse}} After Joseph was in prison for two more years, Pharaoh had two dreams which disturbed him. He dreamt of seven lean cows which rose out of the river and devoured seven fat cows; and, of seven withered ears of grain which devoured seven fat ears. Pharaoh's wise men were unable to interpret these dreams, but the chief cup bearer remembered Joseph and spoke of his skill to Pharaoh. Joseph was called for, and interpreted the dreams as foretelling that seven years of abundance would be followed by seven years of famine, and advised Pharaoh to store surplus grain during the years of abundance. When the famine came, it was so severe that people from surrounding nations ""from all over the earth"" came to Egypt to buy bread as this nation was the only Kingdom prepared for the seven year drought.  In the second year of famine,{{bibleverse}} Joseph's half brothers were sent to Egypt, by their father Israel, to buy goods. When they came to Egypt, they stood before the Vizier but did not recognize him to be their brother Joseph. However, Joseph did recognize them and did not receive them kindly, rather he disguised himself and spoke to them in the Egyptian language using an interpreter. He did not speak at all to them in his native tongue, Hebrew.{{bibleverse}} After questioning them as to where they came from, he accused them of being spies. They pleaded with him that their only purpose was to buy grain for their family in the land of Canaan. After they mentioned that they had left a younger brother at home, the Vizier  demanded that he be brought to Egypt as a demonstration of their veracity. This brother was Joseph's blood brother, Benjamin. He placed his brothers in prison for three days. On the third day, he brought them out of prison to reiterate that he wanted their youngest brother brought to Egypt to demonstrate their veracity. The brothers conferred amongst themselves speaking in Hebrew, reflecting on the wrong they had done to Joseph. Joseph understood what they were saying and removed himself from their presence because he was caught in emotion. Joseph sent the brothers back with food but kept one brother, and the remaining brothers returned to their father in Canaan, and told him all that had transpired in Egypt. They also discovered that all of their money sacks still had money in them, and they were dismayed. Then they informed their father that the Vizier demanded that Benjamin be brought before him to demonstrate that they were honest men.After they had consumed all of the grain that they brought back from Egypt, Israel told his sons to go back to Egypt for more grain. With Reuben and Judah's persistence, they persuaded their father to let Benjamin join them for fear of Egyptian retribution.Upon their return to Egypt, the brothers were afraid because of the returned money in their money sacks. Then when they get there Joseph reveals to them that he is in fact their brother, Joseph. Then has their father Jacob brought so they are all reunited in Egypt"

Garp and Fleet Admiral Sengoku. On a floating island, Monkey D. Luffy is chased by a genetically-enhanced animal. The monster is overpowered by the other monsters before Luffy defeats the fourth monster. The Straw Hats have been separated into three groups: Sanji with Usopp, Roronoa Zoro with Tony Tony Chopper, and Nico Robin with Franky and Brook. Shiki tells Nami that she has been taken to the island against her will and a brief flashback is shown: several days earlier, the Straw Hats read news of an attack on East Blue. Luffy vows to protect the East Blue before witnessing Shiki's ship overhead. After escaping a storm, Shiki meets Nami and reveals his powers to make any inanimate object he touches float. After learning it was Nami that delivered the warning, Shiki offers to take them there before abducting Nami. The others try to rescue her, but Shiki makes the pirates scatter on the island. Shiki asks Nami to become his navigator but she refuses. His henchman Dr. Indigo demonstrates an evolved bird called Billy, who can produce electricity, but Shiki rejects it after Dr. Indigo is electrocuted. He reveals that a plant, called IQ, can cause animals to evolve instantly and to increase strength along the way. Nami protects Billy, and the bird is left with her as Shiki and his men leave. Meanwhile, Sanji and Usopp battle various animals while Sanji searches for Robin and Nami. Meanwhile, Zoro and Chopper rescue a young girl, Xiao, and are led to her village and are told about the large poisonous plants around the village. However, long term exposure to the plants is poisonous to humans, and the girl's grandmother has become ill by it. Xiao was looking for the cure which is the IQ plant, but Shiki has stolen the IQ plants for his experiments. Sanji and Usopp learn that Shiki also takes all the men and young women to his royal palace, leaving the village with only the very young and old, before meeting up with Zoro and Chopper. Nami flees with the help of Billy, and finds the Thousand Sunny along with Luffy. Robin's group discovers that Shiki is planning to release the animals on the island into East Blue to force the World Government's surrender and that he is planning a demonstration against a village on the floating island to show their power. The two join the others at the village, and they also learn of the plan from the village residents. Shiki confronts and defeats the Straw Hats and offers Nami to rejoin him on the condition that the Cocoyashi Village will be taken. Robin's group arrives and rejoin the rest of the crew. Xiao gives them a tone dial and they replay Nami's farewell message, to Luffy's anger. Meanwhile, Nami attempts to destroy the plants protecting his palace, but gets poisoned herself. Shiki traps her near the plants and heads off to meet the pirate captains gathering. While greeting them, the Straw Hats launch a preemptive strike against Shiki and his henchmen. The group manages to defeat them while Chopper and Usopp are ordered to search for Nami. Nami is found by Billy who helps destroy the plants just as Usopp and Chopper arrive. Chopper soon realizes the only way to save Nami is to find the IQ medicine, but Shiki attempts to stop them. Luffy engages Shiki in a duel. The two find the IQ plant, but find the medicine is being held by Dr. Indigo. Zoro manages to defeat Dr. Indigo and Nami recovers. Sanji and Brook, meanwhile, witness another of Shiki's henchmen, Scarlet, attempting to kiss Robin, but Sanji defeats Scarlet. Nami, Usopp and Chopper trick Shiki into redirecting his ship to the island, forcing his crew to flee. The Straw Hats rig the palace with explosives. Shiki refocuses his attention on the Straw Hats, but Luffy uses an electric charge and knocks Shiki to the ground, leaving Luffy victorious. The other Straw Hats escape with the Thousand Sunny, using Shiki's pirate sail as a parachute. Luffy is recovered by Billy while the villagers are shown flying away using the wings on their arms. The Marines capture the retreating pirates, including Shiki. As the Marines witness the islands crash into the sea, now free of Shiki's power, they spot the Thousand Sunny. However, the Straw Hats escape. Luffy later learns that Nami's message had ended with the crew being asked to save her.

At dawn, he arrives drunk at home. Having sex with his wife, Mikel bites Begoña's clitoris during an alcohol-fuelled attempt at oral sex. This incident effectively marks the end of their marriage.

The trouble is, the ""friend"" his mother makes him spend the night with is a bully named Craig Randall. As he enters the house, his mother turns her car radio on, and hears a news report about a rash of kidnappings of children who were found alive tied up in duct tape. For the most part, Craig is persistently hostile towards Anthony. His mother spends time preparing unappetizing meals that are supposed to be healthy, such as homemade tofu squares, fish heads, and spring garden loaf. On some occasions it seems that Craig is ready to become more friendly towards him when they find a shared interest in toys, video games, slime, etcetera, but then resumes his hostility. Anthony's older brother John, is a burnout who spends time with his idiotic girlfriend Jill, and his friends who are plotting to steal a parking meter and break into it for the money, presumably for drugs. Background music during his scenes consist of classic rock from Steely Dan, Jethro Tull, Blue Öyster Cult and The Grateful Dead. When Anthony tries to call him to come and pick him up, he refuses believing that his little brother should learn to be more sociable. At dinner the rest of the family eats foods that Anthony finds unappealing. Craig's mother boasts of Lucy's upcoming role in a school production of Chicago, despite the fact that she's in the middle of a conversation. When Craig and Lucy's father notices that Anthony doesn't like fish heads, he suggests ordering a pizza, which shocks every other family member. Before preparing for bed, Anthony walks in on Craig's sister, who he finds is using his toothbrush to brush her teeth. She compares it to kissing, then explains that she's fond of him because he upsets her brother as well as the rest of the family dynamic, sneaks a kiss on his lips and then runs to bed. Craig accuses Anthony of ""trying to sex his sister,"" and threatens to either tell his parents or kill him in his sleep. Desperate to escape, he calls home again, but both his mother and his brother insist that he should stay the night. His mother suggests that the only way he can come home is if he asks Craig's parents to give him the ride, but when he tries to do so, he sees them on the verge of intimacy with each other. Much to his surprise, his big brother has come to the rescue. John is convinced that by doing this he missed an opportunity for a sexual tryst with his girlfriend, but when Anthony informs him about the kiss he got from Lucy, he thinks he might have a chance with his girlfriend after all. Before they return home, he leaves a note on the Randall's kitchen window, which Mrs. Randall misinterprets as another kidnapping by the Duct Tape Gang. Police and news reporters surround the house, while Anthony sleeps safely at home on the couch."

Reluctantly, she gets out of bed and gets ready to head on out. Before she leaves, she drinks her coffee then performs a breathing exercise to help her relax. In doing so, she addresses the voice from her dreams. Soon after, her friend, Sidonia , drops by to check on her and finds Medina sad and looking at herself in a mirror. Like a good friend, Sidonia tries to lighten the moment, and at the right time, reminds Medina that her friends and family are waiting for her at the wake for her fiancé. Medina gets herself together and she and Sidonia go to the service. Some time has passed since the wake and we now see Medina with her friend Tesla  who admits she's in love with Medina's brother, Enzo , and hints at a possible engagement to him. Medina, though surprised Tesla would be ""in love"", is happy for them both. Medina and Tesla then set off to see an art exhibit but are kicked out twice by the female security guard who apparently remembered them from the duo's wilder times. Medina, still affected by the tragedy weeks earlier is easily upset, but Tesla quickly decides they meet with Enzo for drinks. The three get together and Tesla and Enzo immediately get a light-hearted conversation going to cheer Medina up. Then we cut to Quinn  looking depressed as his friend Fera  meets him walking down the street. He tells Fera that Nilda left him and took everything including his own possessions. He shows her the ""Dear John letter"" written on bathroom tissue. Fera's husband, Camden , arrives and the situation is explained to him. Fera and Camden try to console Quinn, but he leaves to clear his mind with the ""Dear John letter"" still in hand. Fera and Camden follow Quinn to make sure he doesn't do anything anyone will regret. We see Medina and Tesla again as more time has passed. Tesla reminds Medina of an upcoming promotion test which Medina states she has to prepare on her own for. The next scene shows her doing so, with a few clips of her stretching, practicing footwork, spinning swords, staffs and spears. Fera expresses greater concern for Quinn. Camden indicates Fera and Quinn were like brother and sister but the best they can do is continue to look after Quinn. Fera accepts the plan. Camden realizes the show will start soon. He kisses Fera then they both walk toward Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts.  The day of the promotion test has arrived and it is revealed that in order for Medina to become a ""master"", she has to fight and avoid getting knocked down three times, but also has to knock ""Master"" down once. Medina is quickly knocked down the first time by getting kicked in the thigh and losing her balance. She is knocked down a second time be receiving a palm strike to her chest, causing her to gasp for air. Tesla and Enzo are watching on the side and are concerned. Medina quickly plans a better offense and wins the next bout. As Master confirms her promotion, he provides a few words of wisdom. Enzo and Tesla see Medina in the distance and catch up to her. A few weeks have passed and Enzo and Tesla are engaged now. They express concern for the lack of contact but Medina ensures them she has to deal with things. Enzo reminds Medina about the gathering at the restaurant called Françoise's before he and Tesla leave in a cab. A couple of scenes follow with Camden and Fera looking after Quinn and Tesla and Enzo worrying about Medina before a montage of clips are presented with the song ""There For Me"" sung by Bonnie Piesse. Afterwards, Medina goes to Sidonia's house where it is revealed that Sidonia is a psychic and Medina was the most successful of her peers. Then, through a brief demonstration, Sidonia explains that she believes Medina will meet someone and be happy again, but in order to do so, she has to allow herself to fall in love again. Medina meets her ex-boyfriend, Jarrod, for the last time before he gets married to Lumina. He surprises Medina with pastries he made to show her teachings weren't wasted. He wishes her a happy 30th birthday by symbolically ""toasting"" with a couple of cannolis. Meanwhile, Quinn sniffs the ""Dear John letter"" one last time then drops it in a garbage can and walks away. Later on, Medina, after finished working out, opens the door to leave but senses a presence and stops. She turns around and addresses a voice that sounds like Master but he isn't seen. He reminds her of his advice at the promotion which she acknowledges and thanks him then exits. As she walks down a city sidewalk, she is surprised to see Sidonia sitting in a chair in meditation. Sidonia gives Medina a little reminder, just as Master did a little while ago. Knowing she will see Sidonia at her birthday party later, Medina thanks her and walks off. Quinn and Fera arrive a few minutes later and ask Sidonia for directions. She provides it and gives Quinn a pack of tissues to clean his camera lens. Medina talks to the voice and they both agree to part ways. Fera interrupts and recognizes Medina as her favorite fashion designer. Camden tries to calm Fera down by introducing himself, Fera and Quinn who is frozen in place upon seeing Medina. Camden and Fera see that Medina is frozen as well but step aside. After a few seconds, Medina's trance is broken. Quinn breaks from his too then realizes Medina has been distraught nearly to tears. He offers her a tissue from the pack Sidonia had given him. Medina takes one, Quinn apologizes for disturbing her and walks away. Medina feels an urge to smell the tissue and does so then expresses a look of joy. She quickly turns and requests another tissue from Quinn who eagerly gives her the whole pack. Camden and Fera come over and inform Quinn that their dinner reservations at Françoise's was denied because the space was reserved for a big surprise party. Medina realizes it's the same party that Enzo mentioned so it must be for her, then offers Quinn, Camden and Fera to ""crash"" the party. They all become excited and agree to go. As they begin to walk away, Medina looks to the sky and smiles. While holding the tissue in hand, she turns then joins Quinn and the others."

This disturbs a squatting resident named Hesher , who threatens T.J., but when a cop arrives, Hesher tosses an explosive out the window and flees. After school, Dustin finds his car vandalized by an obscene drawing. Dustin assumes T.J. did it and goes after him. Nicole  defends T.J. and gives him a ride home where, to his surprise, Hesher walks in and makes himself at home. Later that night during dinner, Madeleine remarks she would like T.J. to walk with her, and T.J. responds that he has to attend school. Hesher, irritated by T.J.'s defiance, states in his usual vulgar manner that a walk with his grandmother is more important than school. The next day at school, Dustin attacks T.J.. Hesher appears, but he does not defend him. After school, Paul takes T.J. to group therapy in an attempt to help them through the loss of T.J.'s mother. T.J. confronts Hesher about not intervening in the bathroom earlier that day. In response, they go to Dustin's house where Hesher sets Dustin's car on fire and leaves without T.J. The next morning, the police arrive to bring T.J. in for questioning, but no subsequent charges are filed due to lack of evidence. The following day, T.J. goes to the supermarket where Nicole works. After Nicole has finished her shift, Hesher and T.J. follow her in Hesher's van, until she hits another vehicle in a rear-end collision. Hesher scares off the other driver by pinning the blame on him, and subsequently offers a ride to Nicole because her car is broken. Once in the van, Hesher takes Nicole and T.J. to ""his uncle's"" house and the three swim. Once there, Hesher vandalizes the place and leaves suddenly. T.J. and Nicole walk back to Nicole's car, which has a parking ticket. Later that night, T.J. and Paul get into an argument over dinner. Madeleine is saddened that there is 'nothing she can do', and goes to her room. Hesher teaches her how to smoke her medical marijuana from a bong, and promises to go on a walk with her in the morning. However, she dies early the next morning. T.J. uses Paul's credit card to withdraw money from his account, and tries to use it to buy the wrecked car back, but the owner of the garage tells him that the car is gone. T.J. goes to Nicole's apartment to give her the stolen money to help pay her parking ticket, but hears Hesher and Nicole having sex. T.J. is jealous, attacks both Hesher and his van, and rides off on his bike. He goes back to the house, and destroys all of Hesher's possessions, and takes a pair of cutting shears. T.J. goes to Dustin's house, where he threatens to cut off Dustin's toes if he does not tell where the wrecked car is. Dustin tells him that it is in the junk yard, and pins T.J. to the ground. However, Hesher arrives and cuts his nose with the shears. T.J. then goes to the junkyard to sit in the wrecked car and falls asleep in the back seat, dreaming of the car collision that killed his mother. The next morning, as the car is picked up and ready to be crushed, T.J. falls through the windshield. A few hours later, T.J. and Paul attend Madeleine's funeral, at which time Hesher tells a story about losing a testicle, but that he later was happy with his other testicle and penis being intact. Since he promised to walk with Madeleine he wheels her casket outside and down the road, an emotional T.J. and Paul join him. The next day, Paul shows T.J. the compacted remains of his mother's car that Hesher had procured from the junkyard and placed in the driveway. Hesher has disappeared, after painting on their roof ""Hesher was here."""

The only woman aware of his schemes is his office manager and best friend Katherine Murphy , a divorced mother of two. At a party, Danny meets Palmer , a sixth grade math teacher, without his wedding ring on, and they have a connection together. The next morning, she finds the ring and assumes he is married. She refuses to date him because her parents divorced due to adultery and does not want to be an adulteress herself. Instead of telling her the truth, Danny tells her that he is getting divorced from a woman named Devlin, named after Devlin Adams whom Katherine had mentioned was an old college sorority nemesis. Danny tells Palmer that they are getting divorced because she cheated on him with a man named ""Dolph Lundgren"" . Palmer then insists on meeting Devlin. Danny asks Katherine to pose as ""Devlin"" and they go shopping on Rodeo Drive for new clothes to dress like a trophy wife. A made-over Katherine/Devlin then meets with Danny and Palmer and gives them her blessing. However, after hearing Katherine talking on the phone with her kids, Palmer assumes that her kids are Danny's as well. Danny then privately meets with Katherine's kids, Maggie  and Michael , to get them to play along with the ruse. Palmer meets the kids, who then blackmail Danny in front of Palmer to take them all to Hawaii. At the airport, they are all surprised by Danny's goofball cousin Eddie , who has adopted an Austrian disguise as the ""Dolph Lundgren"" that Danny had made up earlier. To maintain the lies, Danny and Katherine are forced to bring him along. At the resort in Hawaii, Danny tells Eddie he is considering asking Palmer to marry him. Katherine and Danny also run into the real-life Devlin Adams  and her husband Ian Maxtone-Jones , who allegedly invented the iPod. Because of Katherine and Devlin's long-time rivalry, Katherine introduces Danny as her husband rather than admit she is a single mother. Later, Palmer decides to spend time with Katherine so that Danny can spend more time with the kids. Danny teaches Michael how to swim, and Katherine and Palmer look on in admiration. Katherine again runs into Devlin, who invites her and Danny out to dinner. Eddie agrees to take Palmer out to dinner so that Danny can go with Katherine. Since he is supposed to be a sheep salesman, Eddie's cover is nearly blown when he is forced to save the life of an actual sheep who choked on a toy whistle, though he nearly kills the animal in the process. At dinner, Devlin asks Danny and Katherine to tell each other what they admire most about each other, and, as Danny and Katherine talk, they start to feel a connection. Later, when Palmer and Eddie return from their dinner date, Palmer suggests that she and Danny get married now, since a drunken Eddie told her about Danny's plans of engagement. Danny and Katherine are both surprised by her proposition, but Danny ultimately agrees. Danny later calls Katherine regarding his confusion, but Katherine says that she will be taking a job in New York City  to get a fresh start to her life. The next day, Palmer confronts Katherine about Danny's feelings for her, which Katherine dismisses. Katherine then runs into Devlin at a bar and admits that she pretended being married to Danny to avoid embarrassment. Devlin confesses that she is divorcing Ian because he is gay and also that he did not invent the iPod but made his money after suing the Los Angeles Dodgers after getting hit by a foul ball. Katherine confides in Devlin about being in love with Danny, but then Danny shows up behind her saying that he is not marrying Palmer and that he is in love with Katherine. Meanwhile, on the plane ride back to the mainland, Palmer meets a professional tennis player  who shares her interests. Sometime later, Danny and Katherine get married."

Johann goes on to win several marathons with record times, and is congratulated by his parole officer. However, after committing several more robberies, Erika begins to suspect Johann. After finding Johann's loot under his bed she asks him to leave, but not before telling him that change is possible. After weeks of Johann failing to contact his parole officer, the officer shows up after a marathon to talk with Johann. The officer expresses concern that Johann is not keeping in contact and cooperating with him. After pressing Johann to talk with him, Johann becomes enraged and bludgeons his parole officer to death with his trophy. After a final meeting with Erika, Johann is apprehended by the police in the hotel room where he had kept his money, having been turned in by a heartbroken Erika. After being handed a confession to sign, Johann breaks out of jail through a window and leads the police on a cross country manhunt on foot. He takes refuge in the house of an old man, and during the process of tying him up, the old man pulls a concealed pocket knife and stabs Johann deeply. Johann takes the old man’s car and drives until he notices a helicopter following him, after which he switches cars with some motorists at a rest stop, and seemingly evades the police. As Johann continues to drive he begins to lose consciousness, and realizes the seriousness of his wound. He pulls over, dying, and calls Erika, asking her to stay on the phone. Finally his breath slows, stops, and he dies.

She feels most attracted to Matthew, but he mistakenly confronts her of being part of a scheme. Trying to hurt Matthew, she borrows money from Terence and buys an expensive present for Jeremy, while posing as a wealthy heiress. After arriving in America, Alison decides to stay in New York for a week before traveling to Texas.

When she comes back from a flight they make love passionately and go to have a good time at a local nightclub. Though identifying as ""Muslims"" in the context of Bosnia's ethnic set-up, religion plays no part in their life. In fact, Amar drinks alcoholic drinks a bit too much - which is forbidden by Islam - and it is this which begins to put their relationship under strain. First of all, Amar loses his job for being drunk at work. Luna is very worried and has little hope of realizing her fragile dream of having a child with Amar.

While there, he overhears an argument coming from within one of the apartments. The argument is between a young woman named Maria and her overbearing Italian mother, who is concerned that her daughter is bringing shame to the family name by associating with another tenant in the building called Eileen, who works as a prostitute. After storming out of the apartment, Maria encounters Pop in the hall and he begins to calm her down and the two eventually go into the building's kitchen to talk. Maria explains that the argument was about her friendship with Eileen, before then admitting her admiration for her friend's beauty and supposed exciting lifestyle. Pop then begins to tell Maria a story of a young woman named Johnnie, who used to live in the building with her husband Frankie about ten years earlier. The film flashes back to Frankie and Johnnie on their fire escape. It is evident that there is an emotional distance between the two, as Frankie seems unhappy with his life, leaving Johnnie, who is pregnant with their baby, to feel isolated. The two reminisce about how they first met, before Frankie mentions an old friend whom he had recently seen. This old friend was in the Navy, and was travelling all over the world. Frankie starts detailing his fascination for Navy life and the prospects it can bring to him, before Johnnie, realizing that Frankie desires to leave her for a better life, tries to change the subject. Pop then narrates that a few weeks later, Johnnie woke one morning to find that Frankie had left her and their unborn baby. Maria asks what happened to the baby, to which Pop informs her that Johnnie had a miscarriage. He also adds that Johnnie eventually changed her name to Mae and moved on with her life, however she remained a tenant in the building. While discussing Mae, Pop mentions another couple who live in the building, Flo and Charley, who were involved with Mae at one point. The film then flashes back and shows the beginning of this couple's relationship. It is shown that Charley was friends with Mae, and she comes to his apartment one morning telling him that she is pregnant. Mae reveals to Charley that she plans on putting the baby up for adoption once it's born. Charley, feeling sorry for Mae, asks her to marry him. A few days later, Flo meets Charley in a bar where he explains this situation to her. Eventually, Charley realizes that he loves Flo and that he can't marry Mae just because he feels sorry for her. He then asks Flo to marry him. As Pop finishes narrating the story to Maria, Flo comes into the kitchen and is shown to be pregnant herself with Charley's baby. Maria and Flo begin talking about what became of Mae. Flo explains that while she and Charley got married, Mae had her baby and put it up for adoption like she said she would. Flo also elucidates that Mae, like she had done before, changed her name, this time to Eileen. Maria then realizes that her friend Eileen is the subject of the stories she has been told. Flo tells Maria about Eileen, who works as a prostitute at a nearby club. One night, she arrives to her apartment to find her lover Billy waiting for her. Billy is a sailor and is in love with Eileen, although she does not reciprocate this feeling. While she removes her makeup and undresses, Billy professes his desire to marry her, stating that he does not care about her past. She interjects by informing him of the many men she has been with and the things she has done with them, before then reflecting of a time when she was in love with a man whom she planned to marry, however he was killed in an accident shortly before their wedding. Billy still expresses his wish to marry her and while doing so, accidentally breaks a porcelain doll given to her by the man she once loved. Eileen then becomes hostile towards Billy, and begins mocking him, telling him she would never marry him and that she would never love him. Billy incidentally brandishes a gun and points it at Eileen, to which she tells him to go ahead and shoot. Billy, not being able to shoot her, walks out of the room and ultimately kills himself. Eileen, at first in a state of shock, sits down at her mirror and begins re-applying her makeup, implying that she will again move on with her continuously troubled life.

His daughter, Jessica, isn't getting along with her stepmother, Amy, because she is not happy about her parents divorce. The next morning, Amy, Jessica and her brother David go on a game drive with Brian, a ranger, while Tom goes to the dam. While driving off-road, David asks the ranger to stop the jeep because he has to ""go"". Brian grabs his rifle and takes David to a tree to ""do his business"". David tells Brian he doesn't have any toilet paper and he tells him to use grass. David is shocked and Brian starts to say something, but before he can finish he is interrupted by a loud growl. Brian raises his rifle and a lioness comes into sight. Amy and Jessica look on in worry and Jessica sees a lion behind Brian and David and shouts in terror. Amy and Jessica try to warn Brian and David as Amy tries to bring the car to them, but discovers Brian took the keys with him. Meanwhile, Brian tells David to get behind him and to move backwards together when he says to. Brian works the action of his rifle and they start to move. Amy gets out and tries to draw the lion's attention. The lion makes a slight roar to the lioness and she charges. Brian tells David to run and starts shooting at the attacking lioness, but misses every shot and the lioness starts outrunning Brian quickly . When Amy and David are back in the car, Brian falls and drops his rifle, but gets up and shuts the door with him outside of the car, realizing that if he doesn't, the lion will kill one of them. He is then attacked and killed by the lioness in front of the rest of them. Amy, Jessica, and David are now trapped in the car and being stalked by the tiny pride of lions, consisting of only two females and one big strong male, who are also eating Brian. Jessica and David panic, but Amy says they will be fine. The lion jumps on top of the car, causing the windshield to crack before leaving the area.In the mean time, back at the lodge, Tom returns to their room and finds that his family hasn't returned from their game drive and is informed that they are missing. David and Jessica have calmed down and Jessica thinks they should get Brian's rifle for protection, but Amy refuses to let either of them get out. They have no food and very little water. That night, Tom asks one of the rangers why can't they search for them on the ground since their chopper doesn't fly at night and the ranger says that they are, but that it won't help much. The ranger then tells him of about Crawford, a professional hunter and guide, who could help him and they call him on the radio. He refuses the request because he leads Big Five hunts, not search parties. That night there is a storm, providing Amy, Jessica and David with precious water as they have run out. The next day they see the car keys through David's camera lens and Amy retrieves them, but as she picks them up, one of the lionesses appears and tries to attack her, but she makes it back to the car in time. Amy starts the car and they drive off in the wrong direction. Jessica starts to act as navigator, but they crash the car and cannot get it started again. Back at the lodge, Tom wants to come with the rangers in their chopper, but they refuse to let him because there is only room for two. Tom goes inside to the female ranger from the night before and asks where he can find Crawford. Back in the car, Amy and Jessica panic when the car won't start and they start to fight again. A ranger drives Tom to Crawford's house, but leaves Tom there alone, in fear, after Tom gets out. Tom tries to get Crawford to help him, but he refuses again, repeating what he said before. Tom offers to pay him anything he wants if he helps him find his family and he finally agrees. They leave in Crawford's car and start looking for signs in the air, as any on the ground have been washed away by the storm. Later, the chopper flies over the area where Amy, Jessica and David are, but doesn't see them, even when Jessica gets out and waves. Amy begins to comfort her, but they are attacked by one of the lionesses. It is shot through the head by two native hunters before it can kill any of them. They try to ask for help, but the hunters don't seem to understand them so Amy tells Jessica to get in the car. Jessica thinks the hunters know where water is so she and Amy go ask. After one figures out what they mean he takes Jessica to a water hole and gives her two gourds to carry water back. They hear a shot ring out and arrive back to find the other hunter has been killed by the pride. Jessica gets in the car and gives Amy and David the water and the other hunter goes in search of his friend. Crawford and Tom pull to a stop and Crawford finds evidence of a lion. He says it is pretty far away and they pitch camp. Around the fire they discuss lion attacks and Crawford tells Tom the truth about them, as he believes they don't attack humans much. Amy and Jessica reconcile that night when Amy tells her how she met her father and swears that her parents were divorced when she met him and that she wouldn't have gone out with him otherwise. The hunter then appears and tries to get in the car. They let him in and he motions for them to be quiet. With his knife at the ready, he watches for the lions. One appears and breaks through the windshield, drags him out and kills him. Amy and Jessica barricade the windshield and get in the back of the car. The next day, Jessica tells Amy her doubts that anyone will save them, and that they will eventually have to get out of the car and find help. Amy says that they have no weapons and that she won't let them die there. David then hears barks and growls from hyenas that are eating the leftovers of the lions and the hunter's skeleton. They barricade the window better, make some shade and make a list of things they have. David shows a lighter he found, believing it belongs to Jessica, but it turns out to be Amy's. She confesses her secret shame that she smokes and they promise to keep it a secret. Crawford and Tom see some buzzards and eventually find a human skeleton eaten by the lions. Later, Amy, Jessica and David see the lion, but he leaves as Crawford and Tom arrive at the other side of the hill. Crawford sees the trail has gone cold, says to pitch camp and that they will head west the next day. Tom objects as he knows the rangers were covering the west and that they were supposed to cover the rest. Crawford says they might never find them if they don't grasp the reality of their situation. Tom tells him he will scour every inch of Africa until he finds them, with or without his help. Crawford hears Amy calling for help, as she has gotten out of the car in order to make some noise, and alerts Tom. They head in the direction of the noise and see them. Crawford tries to tell Tom something, but he has already started down the hill. Crawford loads his rifle and follows him. The final lioness appears and stalks Tom as he fails to understand his family's shouted warnings. Crawford sees the lioness and tells him not to move. Tom finally sees it and tells Crawford to shoot it, but Crawford doesn't have a shot yet. The lioness attacks Tom and when it gets close enough, Crawford tells Tom to duck and shoots the lioness through the heart, killing it. Tom makes his way to the car, but Crawford, on his way up, is killed by the male lion, who then charges Tom who climbs under the car when the door won't open. Amy breaks open the gas tank after telling him and the kids to run when she says to. She uses cloth as a fuse and draws the lion's attention. It climbs in as she says to run and she uses her lighter to light the cloth fuse, causing the truck to explode and kill the lion. Tom runs back to see if it worked and believes Amy is dead, but she appears beside the fire and they all head to Crawford's car to head back to the lodge."

Bengtsson, a Danish novelist celebrated for his unflinching realism. The film’s title refers to a method of torture known as ‘submarino’ in which the target’s head is held under water to just before the point of drowning. Nick and his younger brother have grown up in terrible circumstances: their childhood was marked by poverty, abuse and an alcoholic mother until the family was torn apart by tragedy. Nick is now thirty-three and has just been released from prison. He’s a man who knows what he wants: to train hard and drink hard in order to stand up against a hard world. A bodybuilder, he lives in a dilapidated hostel on the outskirts of Copenhagen. His brother is a junkie and a single father for whom only two things count in life: his daily fix and a better life for his six-year-old son, Martin. Reason enough for him to deal in heroin. The brothers may live separate lives in grim Copenhagen, yet they are somehow searching for each other. What binds them is their mutual struggle for a life worth living. Occasionally their paths cross, but they only really find each other in prison. And that’s almost too late for them. —Berlinale

Urbano tries to remain neutral but his intentions would be brutally punished. The Sunday prior to his wedding to Estrella, while the couple are in the forest enjoying an idyllic moment, everything changes with the presence of the chief, who comes to take revenge. He comes accompanied by his trusty servant, Longinus, and his three sons, who assault the couple. Urbano is tied up to a tree and beaten, while Estrella is brutally raped. However the whole assault is politically motivated as the boss says to his servant when he was denied the chance to do what have his three sons did to the girl, ""is political, not vice."" At another point the mayor is extending its personal view of what happened: ""Women and the laws are to be violated, provided that cause us problems."" Bewildered, Urbano's response is visceral but rational, without resorting to wash his honor and take immediate revenge, as would be more suitable to the melodrama of the time. Thinking in what is best for Estrella and in the future, the family does not report or talk about the rape, and the betrothed marry. What happened serves no other purpose than to sadden the happiness of the bride and relatives. Urbano also sees and makes Juaco, his father in law, see with different eyes, the baby thaat Estrella is expecting as a result of the rape. Urbani takes the baby as his own. However vengeance occurs after some time, but in a way that gives it a certain beauty to the outcome of a sad story. Eventually the couple, along with the child, moved to live in New York, which represents in the film that ideal world, very missed by his grandfather, that rural life amid beautiful scenery could not provide for the ambitions of a local chief ."

She becomes interested in a cattle crush, a device that hugs the cows to ""gentle them"". One day, while having a panic attack, Temple places herself in the device and it helps to calm her down. When Temple first attended college, she was very nervous when she moved into her college dorm. Temple had another panic attack in her room, but her mother gave her space by closing the door. Immediately after, her mother had a flashback to when Temple was little and had relentless tantrums. Before that, Temple was diagnosed with classic autism, a severe case of autism in which she seemed aloof, lacked eye contact, had no language, and avoided human affection and touch. At this time, science classified autism as a form of schizophrenia, blaming mothers as the cause for the disorder and claiming that they were cold and aloof toward their autistic child, naming them ""refrigerator mothers"". The diagnostician suggested placing Temple in an institution. Temple's mother refused to listen to the diagnostician and helped Temple adapt to the everyday world. Her mother hired a speech therapist, who worked one-on-one with Temple and enabled her to acquire language. During Temple's college years, she conceptualized the squeeze machine, which was designed for herself because she had a sensory integration dysfunction and disliked physical affection by people. The machine hugs both sides of her to calm her down, as she controls the pressure, and it makes her relaxed whenever she becomes tense. Even though the machine worked, the school forced Temple to remove it, claiming that it was some kind of sexual device. Later after spring break ended, Temple and her aunt came back to school to persuade the school to let her use the device. Temple later proved through rigorous scientific study that the machine was only a calming device and, as a result, she was allowed to keep it. She uses this machine for self-medicating reasons ever since. Later on, the movie flashes back to when Temple was just being admitted to Hampshire Country School. She was expelled from her previous high school because a child taunted her and she hit him with a book. There, she meets a supportive teacher, Dr. Carlock, who encourages her to go further into science as a career and to eventually attend college. Temple does indeed graduate from college and becomes a worker at a ranch. She rebuilds a new dip, and alters a slaughterhouse for cows so that it is much more humane. The film concludes with an autism fair convention, which Temple and her mother attend. Temple speaks out from the crowd and tells the audience how she overcame her difficulties and was able to achieve academically, as well as how her mother helped her deal with the everyday world. The people become so fascinated that they request Temple to speak in front of the auditorium."

553101Scientist Andre Delambre  is found dead with his head and arm crushed in a hydraulic press. Although his wife Helene ([[Patricia Owens  confesses to the crime, she refuses to provide a motive and exhibits a number of strange behaviors. In particular, she is obsessed with flies, including a supposedly white-headed fly. Andre's brother, Francois , lies and says he caught the white-headed fly and, thinking he knows the truth, Helene explains the circumstances surrounding Andre's death. In flashback, Andre, Helene and their son Philippe  are a happy family. Andre has been working on a matter transporter device called the disintegrator-integrator. He initially tests it only on small inanimate objects, but eventually proceeds to living creatures, including the family's pet cat  and a guinea pig. After he is satisfied that these tests are succeeding, he builds a man-sized pair of chambers. One day, Helene, worried since Andre has not come up from the basement lab for a couple of days, goes down to find Andre with a black cloth over his head and a strange deformity on his hand. Communicating with typed notes only, Andre tells Helene that he tried to transport himself, but a fly got caught in the chamber, which resulted in a mixing of their atoms. Now he has the head and arm of a fly, and the fly has his miniature head and arm, though he keeps his mind. Andre needs Helene to capture the fly so he can reverse the process. Although she expends great effort in her search, she cannot find it and Andre's will begins to fade as the fly's instincts take over his brain. Time is running out, and while Andre can still think like a human, he smashes the equipment, burns his notes, and leads Helene to the factory. When they arrive, he sets the hydraulic press and motions for Helene to push the button. She activates the press twice - once to crush his head and once to crush his left arm. The police, hearing this confession, deem Helene insane and guilty of murder. As they are about to haul her away, Andre's son Philippe tells Francois he's seen the fly trapped in a web in the back garden. Francois convinces the inspector  to come and see for himself. The two men see the fly, trapped in the web, with both Andre's head and arm, looking somewhat aged and terrified. It screams ""Help me! Help me!"" as a large brown spider advances on the creature. Just as the fly is about to be devoured by the spider, the inspector smashes them both with a rock. Thinking nobody would believe the truth, he and Francois decide to lie about the facts of the case so that Helene isn't convicted of murder. In the end, Helene, Francois and Philippe resume their daily lives.

20450767Thirty years after a nuclear apocalypse,{{cite web}} Eli  travels on foot toward the west coast of the United States. Along the way, he demonstrates uncanny survival and fighting skills, hunting wildlife and swiftly defeating a group of highway bandits who try to ambush him. Searching for a source of water, he arrives in a ramshackle town built and overseen by Carnegie . Carnegie dreams of building more towns and controlling the people by using the power of a certain book. His henchmen scour the desolate landscape daily in search of it, but to no avail. In the local town bar, Eli is set upon by a gang of bikers and he kills them all. Realizing Eli is a literate man like himself, Carnegie asks Eli to stay, although it is made clear the offer is non-negotiable. After Carnegie's blind mistress Claudia  gives Eli some food and water, Carnegie orders Claudia's daughter Solara  to seduce Eli. Eli turns her down, but she discovers he has a book in his possession. Eli offers to share his food with her. Before they eat, though, he has her pray with him. The following day, Solara prays with her mother. Carnegie overhears them and realizes Solara's words may relate to the book he has been seeking. He forces Solara to tell him Eli was reading a book. When he asks what kind, she says she does not know, but forms a cross with her two index fingers. Carnegie realizes Eli has a copy of the Bible, the book he wants. Eli sneaks out of his room and goes to the store across the street, where he had earlier given the Engineer  his portable music player to recharge the battery. Carnegie has his henchmen shoot at Eli, but the bullets seemingly just graze him, as if he is being protected. Eli shoots most of Carnegie's men and hits Carnegie in the leg with a shotgun blast. Solara leads Eli to the town's water supply, hoping she can accompany him on his travels. Eli traps her inside and continues on alone. Solara escapes and soon finds herself ambushed by two bandits who attempt to rape her, but Eli appears and kills them. As they continue on, Eli explains to Solara his mission. According to Eli, his book is the last remaining copy of the Bible, as all other copies were intentionally destroyed following the nuclear war. He says he was led to the book by a voice in his head, which then directed him to travel westward to a place where it would be safe. The voice assured him that he would be protected on his journey. Thus, for the last thirty years he has been traveling west, guided by his faith. Eventually, Eli and Solara investigate an isolated house. They fall into a hidden pit, but manage to allay the suspicions of the residents, Martha  and George , who invite them in for tea. When Eli realizes that the couple are cannibals, they attempt to leave, but then Carnegie and his posse arrive. In the ensuing shootout, George, Martha and some of Carnegie's men are killed. Eli and Solara are captured. When Carnegie threatens to kill Solara, Eli gives him the Bible. Carnegie shoots him, and leaves him for dead. Solara escapes and drives back to help Eli. Rather than chase her, Carnegie returns to the town since his sole remaining vehicle is running low on fuel. Solara picks up Eli. They drive until they reach the Golden Gate Bridge. They then row to Alcatraz, where they find a group intent on saving what they can of civilization. Eli tells the guards that he has a copy of the King James version of the Bible. Once inside, Eli, who is revealed to be blind, begins to dictate the Bible from memory to Lombardi , the leader of the group. Meanwhile, back in the town, Carnegie opens the locked Bible, but discovers that it is in Braille. He orders Claudia to read it to him, but she refuses. Carnegie's leg wound has become septic, and he realizes he is going to die. Order breaks down, and the residents start looting. Eli dies, but not before he has finished reciting the Bible. The printing press at Alcatraz begins making copies of the new King James Bible. Lombardi places one on a bookshelf between the Torah and Tanakh on one side and the Qur'an on the other. Solara is offered sanctuary, but she chooses to head back home, taking with her Eli's possessions.
9056967{{Plot}} The cartoon opens with Tom chasing Jerry. Jerry hides behind a potato mound in a garden when he hears Spike the bulldog call to him. Spike has been caught by a dog catcher and locked in the back of his truck, and Jerry is the only one who can help him escape from the truck before it drives away. Despite their differences , Jerry shows Spike mercy and frees him by removing a piece of wood that latches the cage shut. Spike falls out of the truck just as it pulls away, and thanks Jerry by vowing to assist the mouse at any time at the sound of a whistle. Completely carefree, Jerry strolls down the sidewalk, and Tom jumps out from around the corner with a plate, a fork, and a knife, and a napkin around his neck. As Jerry screeches to a stop and reverses direction, Tom sneaks around the fence and holds out two pieces of bread just as the mouse passes by, such that Jerry is unable to stop in time. Just as Tom starts to cut the bread in half with Jerry in it, Jerry whistles and Spike makes the save by grabbing Tom by the neck. He checks on Jerry to make sure he is O.K. and then issues Tom an ultimatum: the cat had better leave Jerry alone or he will face the consequences; and to prove his point, he squashes Tom into an accordion before walking off, reminding his pal once again to ""just whistle"". Seeing an opportunity to provoke Tom, Jerry picks up a tiny board and challenges the cat to a fight, who flippantly flicks the board away and prepares to punch the mouse into oblivion. Jerry then whistles and before the punch lands, Spike zooms in and his own punch lands onto Tom's face, which leaves the cat dazed in front of a city mailbox behind him. Once again, Spike reminds Jerry of their pact: ""Anytime, chum"". Tom then tries to smash Jerry with a lead pipe and the resulting chase takes the duo to Spike. Jerry perches on the dog and pushes on Spike's nose to reveal a sharp set of teeth, as if to say ""Stay away from me"". Before the canine can attack him, Tom wriggles out of the situation by kissing Jerry, dropping him in a stroller and rolling the mouse down the street, using the pipe as a flute. When he passes behind a set of garbage cans, Tom basks in his victory by laughing menacingly; in the same evil voice, he utters ""Infinite power!"" Unfortunately, the cat's attraction to the opposite sex gets the better of him when he soon spots a cute female cat and loudly wolf-whistles at her, momentarily forgetting that this will lead to Spike attacking him. The dog pops up behind him and use two garbage can lids as cymbals on Tom's head. Later, Tom spots Jerry strolling along, still on top of the world and soon the cat notices a bubble gum machine nearby. He shakes, throttles, and nudges the machine to obtain two gumballs, then covers one of them in glue. So as to get Jerry to eat the other piece of gum, the cat sits down and draws attention to himself chewing his piece. The manner in which Tom methodically enjoys his gum makes Jerry hungry for a piece. Tom then offers Jerry the glue-covered gumball, and Jerry suspiciously smells it, but follows through and starts chewing the gum. Jerry then shakes Tom's hand as a thank you and Tom winks at the camera. Quickly, the mouse figures out that the gum has glued his mouth shut and that he is unable to whistle . Using a similar trick to Tom's earlier in the cartoon, Jerry points to his lips and rubs his stomach as if to say that he adored the gum, then leaves the scene with Tom in pursuit. Jerry quickly shakes his hand again and runs away with Tom behind him. Jerry briefly stops the chase to attempt to whistle a second time, and when he is still unable to do so, shrugs and begins to run away again. When he sees an anvil up ahead, the mouse holds it up and Tom runs into it, causing the cat to resemble a table. Jerry tries to escape through a hole in a fence but gets stuck, and as he unsuccessfully tries to free himself, Tom then grabs a slim wooden board and motions to hit Jerry with it...until he sees Spike walk by and decides to wait. Jerry tries to gesture to Spike that he needs help and that he can't whistle, but Spike doesn't understand what Jerry is saying and will only respond to the whistle. With the danger of retaliation past, Tom whacks Jerry all the way towards Spike again. Jerry tries again to tell his friend what happened and begs Spike to help him . Spike laughs at this, calls it ""baby talk"", and goes inside a yard. Jerry then pounds on the door for help, but has to run away from the approaching cat. As Spike opens the door, Tom's head gets stuck in Spike's mouth, forcing the cat to again shrug and run away. The mouse eventually crawls through another hole in a different fence and tries to whistle until he turns red in the face. Eventually, Jerry blows a bubble and it keeps enlarging as Jerry forces more air into it. Tom climbs over the fence to chase the mouse, but soon sees the bubble growing to a gigantic size and cringes in terror as it explodes and bursts into flames. A long, shrill whistle is emitted by the released air and Jerry's cleared mouth, and Tom pleads with Jerry to stop whistling, but he keeps going. ""Knowing"" Spike will completely whale on him, he digs his own grave, but Spike doesn't appear. Tom then writes his will, which says ""I Thomas leave all to charity"". As Tom finishes writing, both cat and mouse look up in puzzlement at the dog's disappearance, and once more find him locked up in the back of the dog catcher's truck again. This time, a padlock keeps the door shut so that Spike will no longer be able to escape the same way again and can no longer help his friend. Still whistling, Jerry chases the truck down the road with Tom chasing him.

The ancestors of the malevolent Mong clan and the righteous Chows split up their territories with a property line and instituted laws to keep each faction from crossing those lines. Those brave enough to traverse the line have their legs cut off by the opposing clan. The Chows want to do away with this ridiculous law and establish relations with the Mongs. But the clan leader Mong Fan  wants nothing more than to totally eradicate his hated enemies. He seeks to recruit the best Kung Fu teacher in the land, Wong Yang  to train his family members.

Teacher Wong tells Mong Fan he is taking Chow Ping back to the Chow’s territory. Both Teacher Wong and Chow Ping fight their way through the Mong hordes and cross over the border where the Chow clan are happy to welcome them. Teacher Wong is impressed with Chow’s Ping’s desire to learn Kung Fu and offers to teach him the martial arts. One of Mong Fan’s lackeys crosses the border to deliver a message to Teacher Wong. Mong Fan insists there is no hard feelings and begs Teacher Wong to continue training the Mongs. Teacher Wong insists they meet up to discuss the matter. During the negotiations, Mong Fan requests that Teacher Wong teach his men the unbeatable Shaolin Pole Style. Mong Fan firsts tries to bribe him, and then tries to blackmail him.

As Teacher Wong starts to do so, he is assaulted by Mong soldiers and seriously wounded. Chao Cheh hides him and tends to his wounds while the Mongs continue to search for him. Mong Fan then orders his men to murder some monks, so he can use his clout to place the blame on the Chow clan. The police soon round up the Chows and it looks like Mong Fan will have his way. But Teacher Wong vows to tutor Chow Ping in the ways of the Shaolin Pole Style. After some intensive training, Chow Ping comes up to speed. Teacher Wong insists that they pay a visit to the home of Mong Fan and expose the truth and clear the name of the Chow family.

Everything happens at the cost of losing their only child to a lung disease. This tragic ending perhaps heightens the drama of the film and makes it worth watching which was perhaps not so initially. Goutam Ghosh also plays a very interesting role as S.R, Nisha’a mentor who just sees talent in his protege and that is all there is to that relationship. There is love and affection between the two-but of that between a mentor and his protege, nothing else. He is a happy go lucky scion of a North Kolkata family who stays in a sprawling mansion literally all by himself and he finally finds peace when he goes to Darjeeling as the music teacher of Disha’s school. The film proves once again that nothing can replace the love between a husband and a wife no matter how many affairs you indulge in because somewhere down the line it is devoid and empty and does not have any lasting value or feelings . However if you realize things too late, things can be tragic as in this film. Parambrata is okay as Arijit and he has already shown his acting abilities in other films. Debaleena Dutt as his colleague with whom he has an affair is quite good as the femme fa-tale, bu then again even she changes in the end. However the film belongs to Parno Mittra who is in her first lead role in a film and boy, does she deliver!She is wonderful restrained and shows a level of maturity in handling her role well . Every scene is enacted by her perfectly well. The music is okay, rather a few of the scenes in the film, one which shows the long winding roads of Darjeeling and another which shows the sprawling North Kolkata mansion in all it’s splendour look quite good.

1774803Bridget Jones  is frustrated: she is in her early thirties, still single, very accident prone and worried about her weight. She works in publicity at a book publishing company in London where her main focus is fantasizing about her boss, Daniel Cleaver . At a New Year party hosted by her parents, she re-meets Mark Darcy , the barrister son of her parents' friends. They had known each other as children. After their initial encounter, Mark thinks that Bridget is a fool and Bridget thinks that he is arrogant and rude, and is disgusted by his jumper with a huge reindeer. After a day beset by a series of mishaps, she misplaces her purse, breaks her coffee mug and gets stuck in a lift. When she returns home that evening, her shopping bags split. She reaches to pull the curtains, only for them to fall off the wall. That is the final straw of a stressful day. When she catches sight of her reflection in the window, she decides to turn her life around. She starts her own diary, which covers all her attempts to stop smoking, lose weight and find her Mr. Right. Bridget and Daniel begin to flirt heavily at work, first over email. After a book launch, they start a relationship, despite the fact that he is a notorious womanizer with a questionable personality, of which Bridget is aware, from when stating earlier in the film that she will not form relationships with alcoholics, workaholics, peeping-toms, megalomaniacs, or perverts. Bridget learns from Daniel that he and Mark have a history and, as a result, hate each other. Daniel informs Bridget of their falling-out, telling her that Mark broke their friendship by sleeping with his fiancée. Daniel's dubious character becomes clearer and clearer to Bridget and she eventually breaks off their relationship when she catches him with another woman, a colleague of his, Lara . After a spectacular departure from the office, in which Daniel's desperate attempts to make Bridget stay spark the comment ""I'd rather have a job wiping Saddam Hussein's arse"", she finds a new job in television. She and Mark have run-ins at a bed and breakfast and at a mutual friend's dinner party. During the party, Mark, who has come to the dinner with his colleague, Natasha , privately confesses to Bridget that, despite her faults, he likes her ""just the way she is"". He later helps Bridget to achieve an important interview for work, in which her quirky approach prompts the classic comment ""Bridget Jones - already a legend"". She begins to develop feelings for Mark. Just as Bridget and Mark's mutual attraction comes together at a birthday dinner party hosted by Bridget, Daniel comes back, temporarily claiming Bridget's attention. Mark originally leaves the party, but returns to face Daniel. Mark punches Daniel and the two fight. They end up in a nearby restaurant and finally smash through the window, landing on the street. Mark wins the battle and knocks Daniel out. Bridget chides Mark but afterwards, after an insensitive appeal by Daniel, she says emphatically that she doesn't want to be with him. Bridget learns the truth about Mark and Daniel's falling-out after her mother lets it out in conversation - that it was actually Daniel who had seduced Mark's wife . At a dinner party the same day, Bridget confesses her feelings for Mark, only to find out that he and Natasha are both leaving to accept jobs in New York. Bridget interrupts the toast to their pending engagement with a halting but moving speech about England losing one of its finest men. Her words clearly have an effect on Mark, as he realises what she really means, but he still flies to New York, though with obvious misgivings. Just as Bridget starts to embark on a trip to Paris with her friends to mend her broken heart, Mark returns to stay with her. When they are about to kiss for the first time, Bridget goes to her bedroom to change her undergarments, remarking that this is ""an occasion for genuinely tiny knickers."" While Bridget is changing, Mark peeks at her diary, in which she has written many insults about him. Bridget returns to find that he has left. Realizing that he had read her diary and that she might potentially lose him again, Bridget runs outside after him in a thin sweater and zebra skin-print underwear. Unable to find him and disheartened, she is about to return home when Mark appears holding a new diary, ""to make a fresh start"". They kiss in the snow-covered streets and the film closes.

Cockney tugboat captain, Mike Turner , discovers the wreck of the ship. Accompanied by second mate Wilbur  and passenger Celeste Whitman , he heads out to claim salvage rights on it, as the tugboat Jenny lost her cargo in the same storm that capsized it. They are soon followed by Dr. Stefan Svevo  and his crew, who claim to be Greek Orthodox medics who received the ship's SOS. They board the doomed vessel and become trapped after the entrance collapses. The group with Turner also encounters the ship's nurse, Gina Rowe, a passenger named Suzanne Constantine, and war veteran Frank Mezzetti who is searching for his missing daughter , which they soon find along with the elevator operator Larry Simpson and as well as a ""billionaire"" named ""Tex"". Later they find the blind Harold Meredith and his wife Hannah, who were waiting for rescue. Water continues to submerge more decks and more explosions occur. Turner and his group find the purser's office, where Svevo decides that he and his men will continue their search for other survivors. Turner agrees and Svevo and his men leave in another direction. Another explosion causes the safe in the purser's office to fall through the floor and open, revealing gold coins  and cash. Turner and Wilbur excitedly gather it and start looking for another way out of the ship. Unknown to Turner and the survivors, Suzanne was actually working with Svevo and sneaked a list containing information about a cargo of crates from the purser's office. She gives it to Svevo, but decides that she doesn't want to go through with his plan anymore. Svevo apologizes and orders Doyle, one of his men to kill Suzanne. He shoots her, but she strikes him with an axe before she dies. After climbing up a few decks, Turner and his group find Svevo and his men gathering a cargo of plutonium. Svevo reveals that his real intention of boarding the Poseidon was to retrieve his lost shipment of plutonium, adding that he can't let Turner and his group go now. However, before they can kill Turner and his group, another explosion occurs, allowing them to escape through another cargo room full of cars, where another of Svevo's men is killed. Water floods the deck as Turner's group proceed to up to the next deck, but Hannah falls into the rising water and Turner loses his salvaged gold. Svevo and his one remaining gunman head back up to the ship's stern, where the rest of Svevo's team attempt to raise the plutonium using a crane up to the hull of the ship, which is still above water but is slowly sinking. In another section of the ship, Turner and the survivors exit the ship through an underwater side door, but due to shortage of scuba tanks, Wilbur  sacrifices himself by swimming underwater and disappearing. Turner and Celeste swim to the tugboat Jenny and move it closer to the Poseidon as the remaining survivors swim towards it. Svevo's men see them and open fire and kill Tex, who willingly holds onto a bottle of champagne as he goes down. Turner's group makes it to his boat and they sail away. Water continues to flood the Poseidon and cause the on-board boilers to explode, which causes the cargo of plutonium to also do so. The Poseidon completely explodes, killing Svevo and his men. On board Turner's boat, Turner accepts that his tugboat Jenny will be taken from him when they get to port, but Celeste reveals a diamond that she salvaged from the Poseidon. Celeste asks Turner, ""Are you going to kiss me now?"" and Turner replies, ""I was going to kiss you anyway."" They kiss and the tugboat Jenny sails away into the sunset with the survivors.

Before the plane takes off, Alex has a premonition that the flight will explode, killing everyone on board. As events from his vision express themselves in reality, he panics and attempts to stop the flight. The resulting commotion leads to the removal of some passengers, including Alex, orphan Clear Rivers, Alex' best friend Tod Waggner, teacher Valerie Lewton, Alex's rival Carter Horton, Carter's girlfriend Terry Chaney and student Billy Hitchcock. After they have been removed from the plane, none of the passengers believe Alex's statement until the airliner explodes in fire. The survivors are devastated and are investigated by two FBI agents who are particularly interested in Alex's vision. After attending a memorial for the Volée Airlines Flight 180 victims, Tod accidentally hangs himself within his clothesline and is deemed a suicide. When Alex and Clear locate his body, mortician William Bludworth tells them that Death is reclaiming the lives of those who escaped its original plan, as is proven when Terry is hit by a speeding bus. While watching a newsfeed detailing Volée Airlines Flight 180's aftermath, Alex concludes that Death is killing the survivors in accordance with the sequence of their intended demises on the plane. Nonetheless, he is too late to save Ms Lewton from a kitchen knife impalement which ultimately causes a house explosion. The remaining survivors  are reunited as Alex explains the situation. Frustrated by Terry's loss and at having no control over his life, Carter attempts suicide by stalling his car on the railroad tracks. Though he changes his mind, Alex rescues him by ripping his seatbelt before the train collides with his car. However, Billy is unexpectedly decapitated by shrapnel from the wreckage. Withdrawing himself from the group, Alex believes that Death skipped Carter and progressed to Billy. Realizing Clear is actually next rather than himself, Alex rushes to her aid and encounters the FBI agents along the way. Meanwhile, Clear is trapped inside her vehicle, surrounded by loose live wires. Alex sacrifices himself on behalf of her safety by grabbing the wires, initiating an explosion which incapacitates him and the screen fades to white. Six months later, Alex, Clear and Carter arrive in Paris and discuss their survival. Fearing that their struggle is unfinished, Alex narrowly avoids a bus. The bus hurls a parking signage towards a neon sign, which descends on Alex. Carter tackles Alex in time and asks him about the next victim, inadvertently standing in the way of the swinging neon sign as the credits roll implying Alex and Clear as the remaining survivors of the Volée Airlines Flight 180.

Although his wife Helene ([[Patricia Owens  confesses to the crime, she refuses to provide a motive and exhibits a number of strange behaviors.

He initially tests it only on small inanimate objects, but eventually proceeds to living creatures, including the family's pet cat  and a guinea pig. After he is satisfied that these tests are succeeding, he builds a man-sized pair of chambers. One day, Helene, worried since Andre has not come up from the basement lab for a couple of days, goes down to find Andre with a black cloth over his head and a strange deformity on his hand. Communicating with typed notes only, Andre tells Helene that he tried to transport himself, but a fly got caught in the chamber, which resulted in a mixing of their atoms.

20450767Thirty years after a nuclear apocalypse,{{cite web}} Eli  travels on foot toward the west coast of the United States. Along the way, he demonstrates uncanny survival and fighting skills, hunting wildlife and swiftly defeating a group of highway bandits who try to ambush him. Searching for a source of water, he arrives in a ramshackle town built and overseen by Carnegie . Carnegie dreams of building more towns and controlling the people by using the power of a certain book. His henchmen scour the desolate landscape daily in search of it, but to no avail. In the local town bar, Eli is set upon by a gang of bikers and he kills them all. Realizing Eli is a literate man like himself, Carnegie asks Eli to stay, although it is made clear the offer is non-negotiable. After Carnegie's blind mistress Claudia  gives Eli some food and water, Carnegie orders Claudia's daughter Solara  to seduce Eli. Eli turns her down, but she discovers he has a book in his possession. Eli offers to share his food with her. Before they eat, though, he has her pray with him. The following day, Solara prays with her mother. Carnegie overhears them and realizes Solara's words may relate to the book he has been seeking. He forces Solara to tell him Eli was reading a book. When he asks what kind, she says she does not know, but forms a cross with her two index fingers. Carnegie realizes Eli has a copy of the Bible, the book he wants. Eli sneaks out of his room and goes to the store across the street, where he had earlier given the Engineer  his portable music player to recharge the battery. Carnegie has his henchmen shoot at Eli, but the bullets seemingly just graze him, as if he is being protected. Eli shoots most of Carnegie's men and hits Carnegie in the leg with a shotgun blast. Solara leads Eli to the town's water supply, hoping she can accompany him on his travels. Eli traps her inside and continues on alone. Solara escapes and soon finds herself ambushed by two bandits who attempt to rape her, but Eli appears and kills them. As they continue on, Eli explains to Solara his mission. According to Eli, his book is the last remaining copy of the Bible, as all other copies were intentionally destroyed following the nuclear war. He says he was led to the book by a voice in his head, which then directed him to travel westward to a place where it would be safe. The voice assured him that he would be protected on his journey. Thus, for the last thirty years he has been traveling west, guided by his faith. Eventually, Eli and Solara investigate an isolated house. They fall into a hidden pit, but manage to allay the suspicions of the residents, Martha  and George , who invite them in for tea. When Eli realizes that the couple are cannibals, they attempt to leave, but then Carnegie and his posse arrive. In the ensuing shootout, George, Martha and some of Carnegie's men are killed. Eli and Solara are captured. When Carnegie threatens to kill Solara, Eli gives him the Bible. Carnegie shoots him, and leaves him for dead. Solara escapes and drives back to help Eli. Rather than chase her, Carnegie returns to the town since his sole remaining vehicle is running low on fuel. Solara picks up Eli. They drive until they reach the Golden Gate Bridge. They then row to Alcatraz, where they find a group intent on saving what they can of civilization. Eli tells the guards that he has a copy of the King James version of the Bible. Once inside, Eli, who is revealed to be blind, begins to dictate the Bible from memory to Lombardi , the leader of the group. Meanwhile, back in the town, Carnegie opens the locked Bible, but discovers that it is in Braille. He orders Claudia to read it to him, but she refuses. Carnegie's leg wound has become septic, and he realizes he is going to die. Order breaks down, and the residents start looting. Eli dies, but not before he has finished reciting the Bible. The printing press at Alcatraz begins making copies of the new King James Bible. Lombardi places one on a bookshelf between the Torah and Tanakh on one side and the Qur'an on the other. Solara is offered sanctuary, but she chooses to head back home, taking with her Eli's possessions.
9056967{{Plot}} The cartoon opens with Tom chasing Jerry. Jerry hides behind a potato mound in a garden when he hears Spike the bulldog call to him. Spike has been caught by a dog catcher and locked in the back of his truck, and Jerry is the only one who can help him escape from the truck before it drives away. Despite their differences , Jerry shows Spike mercy and frees him by removing a piece of wood that latches the cage shut. Spike falls out of the truck just as it pulls away, and thanks Jerry by vowing to assist the mouse at any time at the sound of a whistle. Completely carefree, Jerry strolls down the sidewalk, and Tom jumps out from around the corner with a plate, a fork, and a knife, and a napkin around his neck. As Jerry screeches to a stop and reverses direction, Tom sneaks around the fence and holds out two pieces of bread just as the mouse passes by, such that Jerry is unable to stop in time. Just as Tom starts to cut the bread in half with Jerry in it, Jerry whistles and Spike makes the save by grabbing Tom by the neck. He checks on Jerry to make sure he is O.K. and then issues Tom an ultimatum: the cat had better leave Jerry alone or he will face the consequences; and to prove his point, he squashes Tom into an accordion before walking off, reminding his pal once again to ""just whistle"". Seeing an opportunity to provoke Tom, Jerry picks up a tiny board and challenges the cat to a fight, who flippantly flicks the board away and prepares to punch the mouse into oblivion. Jerry then whistles and before the punch lands, Spike zooms in and his own punch lands onto Tom's face, which leaves the cat dazed in front of a city mailbox behind him. Once again, Spike reminds Jerry of their pact: ""Anytime, chum"". Tom then tries to smash Jerry with a lead pipe and the resulting chase takes the duo to Spike. Jerry perches on the dog and pushes on Spike's nose to reveal a sharp set of teeth, as if to say ""Stay away from me"". Before the canine can attack him, Tom wriggles out of the situation by kissing Jerry, dropping him in a stroller and rolling the mouse down the street, using the pipe as a flute. When he passes behind a set of garbage cans, Tom basks in his victory by laughing menacingly; in the same evil voice, he utters ""Infinite power!"" Unfortunately, the cat's attraction to the opposite sex gets the better of him when he soon spots a cute female cat and loudly wolf-whistles at her, momentarily forgetting that this will lead to Spike attacking him. The dog pops up behind him and use two garbage can lids as cymbals on Tom's head. Later, Tom spots Jerry strolling along, still on top of the world and soon the cat notices a bubble gum machine nearby. He shakes, throttles, and nudges the machine to obtain two gumballs, then covers one of them in glue. So as to get Jerry to eat the other piece of gum, the cat sits down and draws attention to himself chewing his piece. The manner in which Tom methodically enjoys his gum makes Jerry hungry for a piece. Tom then offers Jerry the glue-covered gumball, and Jerry suspiciously smells it, but follows through and starts chewing the gum. Jerry then shakes Tom's hand as a thank you and Tom winks at the camera. Quickly, the mouse figures out that the gum has glued his mouth shut and that he is unable to whistle . Using a similar trick to Tom's earlier in the cartoon, Jerry points to his lips and rubs his stomach as if to say that he adored the gum, then leaves the scene with Tom in pursuit. Jerry quickly shakes his hand again and runs away with Tom behind him. Jerry briefly stops the chase to attempt to whistle a second time, and when he is still unable to do so, shrugs and begins to run away again. When he sees an anvil up ahead, the mouse holds it up and Tom runs into it, causing the cat to resemble a table. Jerry tries to escape through a hole in a fence but gets stuck, and as he unsuccessfully tries to free himself, Tom then grabs a slim wooden board and motions to hit Jerry with it...until he sees Spike walk by and decides to wait. Jerry tries to gesture to Spike that he needs help and that he can't whistle, but Spike doesn't understand what Jerry is saying and will only respond to the whistle. With the danger of retaliation past, Tom whacks Jerry all the way towards Spike again. Jerry tries again to tell his friend what happened and begs Spike to help him . Spike laughs at this, calls it ""baby talk"", and goes inside a yard. Jerry then pounds on the door for help, but has to run away from the approaching cat. As Spike opens the door, Tom's head gets stuck in Spike's mouth, forcing the cat to again shrug and run away. The mouse eventually crawls through another hole in a different fence and tries to whistle until he turns red in the face. Eventually, Jerry blows a bubble and it keeps enlarging as Jerry forces more air into it. Tom climbs over the fence to chase the mouse, but soon sees the bubble growing to a gigantic size and cringes in terror as it explodes and bursts into flames. A long, shrill whistle is emitted by the released air and Jerry's cleared mouth, and Tom pleads with Jerry to stop whistling, but he keeps going. ""Knowing"" Spike will completely whale on him, he digs his own grave, but Spike doesn't appear. Tom then writes his will, which says ""I Thomas leave all to charity"". As Tom finishes writing, both cat and mouse look up in puzzlement at the dog's disappearance, and once more find him locked up in the back of the dog catcher's truck again. This time, a padlock keeps the door shut so that Spike will no longer be able to escape the same way again and can no longer help his friend. Still whistling, Jerry chases the truck down the road with Tom chasing him.

10822118In the town of Ho Si, two prominent Chinese clans have a family feud dating back centuries. The ancestors of the malevolent Mong clan and the righteous Chows split up their territories with a property line and instituted laws to keep each faction from crossing those lines. Those brave enough to traverse the line have their legs cut off by the opposing clan. The Chows want to do away with this ridiculous law and establish relations with the Mongs. But the clan leader Mong Fan  wants nothing more than to totally eradicate his hated enemies. He seeks to recruit the best Kung Fu teacher in the land, Wong Yang  to train his family members. Teacher Wong refuses because he knows that Mong Fan’s men will use his teachings only for selfish purposes. Mong Fan comes up with an idea to frame Teacher Wong for murder. He arranges for a hired hand to start a fight with Teacher Wong in the center of town in front of the townsfolk. The man who challenges Teacher Wong is no match for him, and when the guy stumbles backwards after Teacher Wong pushes him away, he ends up falling onto wooden spikes that puncture his flesh. The guy promptly dies in view of everyone, and the townspeople turn against the respected Kung Fu instructor. Rather than face arrest, Teacher Wong flees so he can prove his innocence. An emissary of the Mong clan finds Teacher Wong hiding out, and claims that in exchange for martial arts lessons, Mong Fan will use his political clout to clear his name. Rather than face the alternative, Teacher Wong agrees to educate the Mongs in the ways of Kung Fu. Chow Ping  is a member of the Chow family who risks life and limb to traverse the boundary lines in order to witness Teacher Wong’s agonizing lessons. Then Chow Ping returns to his makeshift training room to practice what he learned from the training sessions. At the Mong palace, Teacher Wong meets Chao Cheh , a beautiful young lady  who takes a liking to him. The careless Chow Ping is captured on the Mong territory and brought to Mong Fan for sentencing before they remove his limbs. Teacher Wong overhears and speaks up on behalf of Chow Ping. Teacher Wong tells Mong Fan he is taking Chow Ping back to the Chow’s territory. Both Teacher Wong and Chow Ping fight their way through the Mong hordes and cross over the border where the Chow clan are happy to welcome them. Teacher Wong is impressed with Chow’s Ping’s desire to learn Kung Fu and offers to teach him the martial arts. One of Mong Fan’s lackeys crosses the border to deliver a message to Teacher Wong. Mong Fan insists there is no hard feelings and begs Teacher Wong to continue training the Mongs. Teacher Wong insists they meet up to discuss the matter. During the negotiations, Mong Fan requests that Teacher Wong teach his men the unbeatable Shaolin Pole Style. Mong Fan firsts tries to bribe him, and then tries to blackmail him. Teacher Wong responds by accusing the Mongs of setting him up on the murder charge. Mong Fan tells him to collect his belongings and leave the Mong property. As Teacher Wong starts to do so, he is assaulted by Mong soldiers and seriously wounded. Chao Cheh hides him and tends to his wounds while the Mongs continue to search for him. Mong Fan then orders his men to murder some monks, so he can use his clout to place the blame on the Chow clan. The police soon round up the Chows and it looks like Mong Fan will have his way. But Teacher Wong vows to tutor Chow Ping in the ways of the Shaolin Pole Style. After some intensive training, Chow Ping comes up to speed. Teacher Wong insists that they pay a visit to the home of Mong Fan and expose the truth and clear the name of the Chow family. However, Mong Fan learns of their upcoming arrival, and plans a trap to eradicate his enemies.

36292850‘Ekla Akash’ is a story of love, despair, infidelity and a tragedy in general. It deals with a troubled marriage between a young couple, Arijit and Nisha. The ambitious couple have reached a point in their relationship from where there is no turning back so they continue to live with each other and their child is also born. Arijit’s infidelity is primarily the reason as he is having an affair with his colleague . Arijit also has questions regarding Nisha’s special relationship with her mentor S.R, who is a film director and wants to make a film star. Eventually he does make her a star, but it only makes things worse. The film is an extremely dramatic film and can be depressing for most people. You might even hate Arijit and call him names, but eventually that anger lessens because he realizes the meaning of true love, of a family, of what it feels to be like a father and what he had done with his life so far. Though the relationship is at crossroads, yet both of realize their own mistakes and come back to each other, but then it is too late. Everything happens at the cost of losing their only child to a lung disease. This tragic ending perhaps heightens the drama of the film and makes it worth watching which was perhaps not so initially. Goutam Ghosh also plays a very interesting role as S.R, Nisha’a mentor who just sees talent in his protege and that is all there is to that relationship. There is love and affection between the two-but of that between a mentor and his protege, nothing else. He is a happy go lucky scion of a North Kolkata family who stays in a sprawling mansion literally all by himself and he finally finds peace when he goes to Darjeeling as the music teacher of Disha’s school. The film proves once again that nothing can replace the love between a husband and a wife no matter how many affairs you indulge in because somewhere down the line it is devoid and empty and does not have any lasting value or feelings . However if you realize things too late, things can be tragic as in this film. Parambrata is okay as Arijit and he has already shown his acting abilities in other films. Debaleena Dutt as his colleague with whom he has an affair is quite good as the femme fa-tale, bu then again even she changes in the end. However the film belongs to Parno Mittra who is in her first lead role in a film and boy, does she deliver!She is wonderful restrained and shows a level of maturity in handling her role well . Every scene is enacted by her perfectly well. The music is okay, rather a few of the scenes in the film, one which shows the long winding roads of Darjeeling and another which shows the sprawling North Kolkata mansion in all it’s splendour look quite good.

Daniel's dubious character becomes clearer and clearer to Bridget and she eventually breaks off their relationship when she catches him with another woman, a colleague of his, Lara . After a spectacular departure from the office, in which Daniel's desperate attempts to make Bridget stay spark the comment ""I'd rather have a job wiping Saddam Hussein's arse"", she finds a new job in television. She and Mark have run-ins at a bed and breakfast and at a mutual friend's dinner party. During the party, Mark, who has come to the dinner with his colleague, Natasha , privately confesses to Bridget that, despite her faults, he likes her ""just the way she is"". He later helps Bridget to achieve an important interview for work, in which her quirky approach prompts the classic comment ""Bridget Jones - already a legend"". She begins to develop feelings for Mark. Just as Bridget and Mark's mutual attraction comes together at a birthday dinner party hosted by Bridget, Daniel comes back, temporarily claiming Bridget's attention. Mark originally leaves the party, but returns to face Daniel. Mark punches Daniel and the two fight. They end up in a nearby restaurant and finally smash through the window, landing on the street. Mark wins the battle and knocks Daniel out. Bridget chides Mark but afterwards, after an insensitive appeal by Daniel, she says emphatically that she doesn't want to be with him. Bridget learns the truth about Mark and Daniel's falling-out after her mother lets it out in conversation - that it was actually Daniel who had seduced Mark's wife . At a dinner party the same day, Bridget confesses her feelings for Mark, only to find out that he and Natasha are both leaving to accept jobs in New York. Bridget interrupts the toast to their pending engagement with a halting but moving speech about England losing one of its finest men. Her words clearly have an effect on Mark, as he realises what she really means, but he still flies to New York, though with obvious misgivings. Just as Bridget starts to embark on a trip to Paris with her friends to mend her broken heart, Mark returns to stay with her. When they are about to kiss for the first time, Bridget goes to her bedroom to change her undergarments, remarking that this is ""an occasion for genuinely tiny knickers."" While Bridget is changing, Mark peeks at her diary, in which she has written many insults about him. Bridget returns to find that he has left. Realizing that he had read her diary and that she might potentially lose him again, Bridget runs outside after him in a thin sweater and zebra skin-print underwear. Unable to find him and disheartened, she is about to return home when Mark appears holding a new diary, ""to make a fresh start"". They kiss in the snow-covered streets and the film closes.

Cockney tugboat captain, Mike Turner , discovers the wreck of the ship. Accompanied by second mate Wilbur  and passenger Celeste Whitman , he heads out to claim salvage rights on it, as the tugboat Jenny lost her cargo in the same storm that capsized it. They are soon followed by Dr. Stefan Svevo  and his crew, who claim to be Greek Orthodox medics who received the ship's SOS. They board the doomed vessel and become trapped after the entrance collapses. The group with Turner also encounters the ship's nurse, Gina Rowe, a passenger named Suzanne Constantine, and war veteran Frank Mezzetti who is searching for his missing daughter , which they soon find along with the elevator operator Larry Simpson and as well as a ""billionaire"" named ""Tex"". Later they find the blind Harold Meredith and his wife Hannah, who were waiting for rescue. Water continues to submerge more decks and more explosions occur. Turner and his group find the purser's office, where Svevo decides that he and his men will continue their search for other survivors. Turner agrees and Svevo and his men leave in another direction. Another explosion causes the safe in the purser's office to fall through the floor and open, revealing gold coins  and cash. Turner and Wilbur excitedly gather it and start looking for another way out of the ship. Unknown to Turner and the survivors, Suzanne was actually working with Svevo and sneaked a list containing information about a cargo of crates from the purser's office. She gives it to Svevo, but decides that she doesn't want to go through with his plan anymore. Svevo apologizes and orders Doyle, one of his men to kill Suzanne. He shoots her, but she strikes him with an axe before she dies. After climbing up a few decks, Turner and his group find Svevo and his men gathering a cargo of plutonium. Svevo reveals that his real intention of boarding the Poseidon was to retrieve his lost shipment of plutonium, adding that he can't let Turner and his group go now. However, before they can kill Turner and his group, another explosion occurs, allowing them to escape through another cargo room full of cars, where another of Svevo's men is killed. Water floods the deck as Turner's group proceed to up to the next deck, but Hannah falls into the rising water and Turner loses his salvaged gold. Svevo and his one remaining gunman head back up to the ship's stern, where the rest of Svevo's team attempt to raise the plutonium using a crane up to the hull of the ship, which is still above water but is slowly sinking. In another section of the ship, Turner and the survivors exit the ship through an underwater side door, but due to shortage of scuba tanks, Wilbur  sacrifices himself by swimming underwater and disappearing. Turner and Celeste swim to the tugboat Jenny and move it closer to the Poseidon as the remaining survivors swim towards it. Svevo's men see them and open fire and kill Tex, who willingly holds onto a bottle of champagne as he goes down. Turner's group makes it to his boat and they sail away. Water continues to flood the Poseidon and cause the on-board boilers to explode, which causes the cargo of plutonium to also do so. The Poseidon completely explodes, killing Svevo and his men. On board Turner's boat, Turner accepts that his tugboat Jenny will be taken from him when they get to port, but Celeste reveals a diamond that she salvaged from the Poseidon. Celeste asks Turner, ""Are you going to kiss me now?"" and Turner replies, ""I was going to kiss you anyway."" They kiss and the tugboat Jenny sails away into the sunset with the survivors.

Kennedy International Airport in New York City to Charles de Gaulle International Airport in Paris. Before the plane takes off, Alex has a premonition that the flight will explode, killing everyone on board. As events from his vision express themselves in reality, he panics and attempts to stop the flight. The resulting commotion leads to the removal of some passengers, including Alex, orphan Clear Rivers, Alex' best friend Tod Waggner, teacher Valerie Lewton, Alex's rival Carter Horton, Carter's girlfriend Terry Chaney and student Billy Hitchcock. After they have been removed from the plane, none of the passengers believe Alex's statement until the airliner explodes in fire. The survivors are devastated and are investigated by two FBI agents who are particularly interested in Alex's vision. After attending a memorial for the Volée Airlines Flight 180 victims, Tod accidentally hangs himself within his clothesline and is deemed a suicide. When Alex and Clear locate his body, mortician William Bludworth tells them that Death is reclaiming the lives of those who escaped its original plan, as is proven when Terry is hit by a speeding bus. While watching a newsfeed detailing Volée Airlines Flight 180's aftermath, Alex concludes that Death is killing the survivors in accordance with the sequence of their intended demises on the plane. Nonetheless, he is too late to save Ms Lewton from a kitchen knife impalement which ultimately causes a house explosion. The remaining survivors  are reunited as Alex explains the situation. Frustrated by Terry's loss and at having no control over his life, Carter attempts suicide by stalling his car on the railroad tracks. Though he changes his mind, Alex rescues him by ripping his seatbelt before the train collides with his car. However, Billy is unexpectedly decapitated by shrapnel from the wreckage. Withdrawing himself from the group, Alex believes that Death skipped Carter and progressed to Billy. Realizing Clear is actually next rather than himself, Alex rushes to her aid and encounters the FBI agents along the way. Meanwhile, Clear is trapped inside her vehicle, surrounded by loose live wires. Alex sacrifices himself on behalf of her safety by grabbing the wires, initiating an explosion which incapacitates him and the screen fades to white. Six months later, Alex, Clear and Carter arrive in Paris and discuss their survival. Fearing that their struggle is unfinished, Alex narrowly avoids a bus. The bus hurls a parking signage towards a neon sign, which descends on Alex. Carter tackles Alex in time and asks him about the next victim, inadvertently standing in the way of the swinging neon sign as the credits roll implying Alex and Clear as the remaining survivors of the Volée Airlines Flight 180.

He says he was led to the book by a voice in his head, which then directed him to travel westward to a place where it would be safe. The voice assured him that he would be protected on his journey. Thus, for the last thirty years he has been traveling west, guided by his faith. Eventually, Eli and Solara investigate an isolated house. They fall into a hidden pit, but manage to allay the suspicions of the residents, Martha  and George , who invite them in for tea. When Eli realizes that the couple are cannibals, they attempt to leave, but then Carnegie and his posse arrive. In the ensuing shootout, George, Martha and some of Carnegie's men are killed. Eli and Solara are captured. When Carnegie threatens to kill Solara, Eli gives him the Bible. Carnegie shoots him, and leaves him for dead. Solara escapes and drives back to help Eli. Rather than chase her, Carnegie returns to the town since his sole remaining vehicle is running low on fuel. Solara picks up Eli. They drive until they reach the Golden Gate Bridge. They then row to Alcatraz, where they find a group intent on saving what they can of civilization. Eli tells the guards that he has a copy of the King James version of the Bible. Once inside, Eli, who is revealed to be blind, begins to dictate the Bible from memory to Lombardi , the leader of the group. Meanwhile, back in the town, Carnegie opens the locked Bible, but discovers that it is in Braille. He orders Claudia to read it to him, but she refuses. Carnegie's leg wound has become septic, and he realizes he is going to die. Order breaks down, and the residents start looting. Eli dies, but not before he has finished reciting the Bible. The printing press at Alcatraz begins making copies of the new King James Bible. Lombardi places one on a bookshelf between the Torah and Tanakh on one side and the Qur'an on the other. Solara is offered sanctuary, but she chooses to head back home, taking with her Eli's possessions.
9056967{{Plot}} The cartoon opens with Tom chasing Jerry. Jerry hides behind a potato mound in a garden when he hears Spike the bulldog call to him. Spike has been caught by a dog catcher and locked in the back of his truck, and Jerry is the only one who can help him escape from the truck before it drives away. Despite their differences , Jerry shows Spike mercy and frees him by removing a piece of wood that latches the cage shut. Spike falls out of the truck just as it pulls away, and thanks Jerry by vowing to assist the mouse at any time at the sound of a whistle. Completely carefree, Jerry strolls down the sidewalk, and Tom jumps out from around the corner with a plate, a fork, and a knife, and a napkin around his neck. As Jerry screeches to a stop and reverses direction, Tom sneaks around the fence and holds out two pieces of bread just as the mouse passes by, such that Jerry is unable to stop in time. Just as Tom starts to cut the bread in half with Jerry in it, Jerry whistles and Spike makes the save by grabbing Tom by the neck. He checks on Jerry to make sure he is O.K. and then issues Tom an ultimatum: the cat had better leave Jerry alone or he will face the consequences; and to prove his point, he squashes Tom into an accordion before walking off, reminding his pal once again to ""just whistle"". Seeing an opportunity to provoke Tom, Jerry picks up a tiny board and challenges the cat to a fight, who flippantly flicks the board away and prepares to punch the mouse into oblivion. Jerry then whistles and before the punch lands, Spike zooms in and his own punch lands onto Tom's face, which leaves the cat dazed in front of a city mailbox behind him. Once again, Spike reminds Jerry of their pact: ""Anytime, chum"". Tom then tries to smash Jerry with a lead pipe and the resulting chase takes the duo to Spike. Jerry perches on the dog and pushes on Spike's nose to reveal a sharp set of teeth, as if to say ""Stay away from me"". Before the canine can attack him, Tom wriggles out of the situation by kissing Jerry, dropping him in a stroller and rolling the mouse down the street, using the pipe as a flute. When he passes behind a set of garbage cans, Tom basks in his victory by laughing menacingly; in the same evil voice, he utters ""Infinite power!"" Unfortunately, the cat's attraction to the opposite sex gets the better of him when he soon spots a cute female cat and loudly wolf-whistles at her, momentarily forgetting that this will lead to Spike attacking him. The dog pops up behind him and use two garbage can lids as cymbals on Tom's head. Later, Tom spots Jerry strolling along, still on top of the world and soon the cat notices a bubble gum machine nearby. He shakes, throttles, and nudges the machine to obtain two gumballs, then covers one of them in glue. So as to get Jerry to eat the other piece of gum, the cat sits down and draws attention to himself chewing his piece. The manner in which Tom methodically enjoys his gum makes Jerry hungry for a piece. Tom then offers Jerry the glue-covered gumball, and Jerry suspiciously smells it, but follows through and starts chewing the gum. Jerry then shakes Tom's hand as a thank you and Tom winks at the camera. Quickly, the mouse figures out that the gum has glued his mouth shut and that he is unable to whistle . Using a similar trick to Tom's earlier in the cartoon, Jerry points to his lips and rubs his stomach as if to say that he adored the gum, then leaves the scene with Tom in pursuit. Jerry quickly shakes his hand again and runs away with Tom behind him. Jerry briefly stops the chase to attempt to whistle a second time, and when he is still unable to do so, shrugs and begins to run away again. When he sees an anvil up ahead, the mouse holds it up and Tom runs into it, causing the cat to resemble a table. Jerry tries to escape through a hole in a fence but gets stuck, and as he unsuccessfully tries to free himself, Tom then grabs a slim wooden board and motions to hit Jerry with it...until he sees Spike walk by and decides to wait. Jerry tries to gesture to Spike that he needs help and that he can't whistle, but Spike doesn't understand what Jerry is saying and will only respond to the whistle. With the danger of retaliation past, Tom whacks Jerry all the way towards Spike again. Jerry tries again to tell his friend what happened and begs Spike to help him . Spike laughs at this, calls it ""baby talk"", and goes inside a yard. Jerry then pounds on the door for help, but has to run away from the approaching cat. As Spike opens the door, Tom's head gets stuck in Spike's mouth, forcing the cat to again shrug and run away. The mouse eventually crawls through another hole in a different fence and tries to whistle until he turns red in the face. Eventually, Jerry blows a bubble and it keeps enlarging as Jerry forces more air into it. Tom climbs over the fence to chase the mouse, but soon sees the bubble growing to a gigantic size and cringes in terror as it explodes and bursts into flames. A long, shrill whistle is emitted by the released air and Jerry's cleared mouth, and Tom pleads with Jerry to stop whistling, but he keeps going. ""Knowing"" Spike will completely whale on him, he digs his own grave, but Spike doesn't appear. Tom then writes his will, which says ""I Thomas leave all to charity"". As Tom finishes writing, both cat and mouse look up in puzzlement at the dog's disappearance, and once more find him locked up in the back of the dog catcher's truck again. This time, a padlock keeps the door shut so that Spike will no longer be able to escape the same way again and can no longer help his friend. Still whistling, Jerry chases the truck down the road with Tom chasing him.

10822118In the town of Ho Si, two prominent Chinese clans have a family feud dating back centuries. The ancestors of the malevolent Mong clan and the righteous Chows split up their territories with a property line and instituted laws to keep each faction from crossing those lines. Those brave enough to traverse the line have their legs cut off by the opposing clan. The Chows want to do away with this ridiculous law and establish relations with the Mongs. But the clan leader Mong Fan  wants nothing more than to totally eradicate his hated enemies. He seeks to recruit the best Kung Fu teacher in the land, Wong Yang  to train his family members. Teacher Wong refuses because he knows that Mong Fan’s men will use his teachings only for selfish purposes. Mong Fan comes up with an idea to frame Teacher Wong for murder. He arranges for a hired hand to start a fight with Teacher Wong in the center of town in front of the townsfolk. The man who challenges Teacher Wong is no match for him, and when the guy stumbles backwards after Teacher Wong pushes him away, he ends up falling onto wooden spikes that puncture his flesh. The guy promptly dies in view of everyone, and the townspeople turn against the respected Kung Fu instructor. Rather than face arrest, Teacher Wong flees so he can prove his innocence. An emissary of the Mong clan finds Teacher Wong hiding out, and claims that in exchange for martial arts lessons, Mong Fan will use his political clout to clear his name. Rather than face the alternative, Teacher Wong agrees to educate the Mongs in the ways of Kung Fu. Chow Ping  is a member of the Chow family who risks life and limb to traverse the boundary lines in order to witness Teacher Wong’s agonizing lessons. Then Chow Ping returns to his makeshift training room to practice what he learned from the training sessions. At the Mong palace, Teacher Wong meets Chao Cheh , a beautiful young lady  who takes a liking to him. The careless Chow Ping is captured on the Mong territory and brought to Mong Fan for sentencing before they remove his limbs. Teacher Wong overhears and speaks up on behalf of Chow Ping. Teacher Wong tells Mong Fan he is taking Chow Ping back to the Chow’s territory. Both Teacher Wong and Chow Ping fight their way through the Mong hordes and cross over the border where the Chow clan are happy to welcome them. Teacher Wong is impressed with Chow’s Ping’s desire to learn Kung Fu and offers to teach him the martial arts. One of Mong Fan’s lackeys crosses the border to deliver a message to Teacher Wong. Mong Fan insists there is no hard feelings and begs Teacher Wong to continue training the Mongs. Teacher Wong insists they meet up to discuss the matter. During the negotiations, Mong Fan requests that Teacher Wong teach his men the unbeatable Shaolin Pole Style. Mong Fan firsts tries to bribe him, and then tries to blackmail him. Teacher Wong responds by accusing the Mongs of setting him up on the murder charge. Mong Fan tells him to collect his belongings and leave the Mong property. As Teacher Wong starts to do so, he is assaulted by Mong soldiers and seriously wounded. Chao Cheh hides him and tends to his wounds while the Mongs continue to search for him. Mong Fan then orders his men to murder some monks, so he can use his clout to place the blame on the Chow clan. The police soon round up the Chows and it looks like Mong Fan will have his way. But Teacher Wong vows to tutor Chow Ping in the ways of the Shaolin Pole Style. After some intensive training, Chow Ping comes up to speed. Teacher Wong insists that they pay a visit to the home of Mong Fan and expose the truth and clear the name of the Chow family. However, Mong Fan learns of their upcoming arrival, and plans a trap to eradicate his enemies.

36292850‘Ekla Akash’ is a story of love, despair, infidelity and a tragedy in general. It deals with a troubled marriage between a young couple, Arijit and Nisha. The ambitious couple have reached a point in their relationship from where there is no turning back so they continue to live with each other and their child is also born. Arijit’s infidelity is primarily the reason as he is having an affair with his colleague . Arijit also has questions regarding Nisha’s special relationship with her mentor S.R, who is a film director and wants to make a film star. Eventually he does make her a star, but it only makes things worse. The film is an extremely dramatic film and can be depressing for most people. You might even hate Arijit and call him names, but eventually that anger lessens because he realizes the meaning of true love, of a family, of what it feels to be like a father and what he had done with his life so far. Though the relationship is at crossroads, yet both of realize their own mistakes and come back to each other, but then it is too late. Everything happens at the cost of losing their only child to a lung disease. This tragic ending perhaps heightens the drama of the film and makes it worth watching which was perhaps not so initially. Goutam Ghosh also plays a very interesting role as S.R, Nisha’a mentor who just sees talent in his protege and that is all there is to that relationship. There is love and affection between the two-but of that between a mentor and his protege, nothing else. He is a happy go lucky scion of a North Kolkata family who stays in a sprawling mansion literally all by himself and he finally finds peace when he goes to Darjeeling as the music teacher of Disha’s school. The film proves once again that nothing can replace the love between a husband and a wife no matter how many affairs you indulge in because somewhere down the line it is devoid and empty and does not have any lasting value or feelings . However if you realize things too late, things can be tragic as in this film. Parambrata is okay as Arijit and he has already shown his acting abilities in other films. Debaleena Dutt as his colleague with whom he has an affair is quite good as the femme fa-tale, bu then again even she changes in the end. However the film belongs to Parno Mittra who is in her first lead role in a film and boy, does she deliver!She is wonderful restrained and shows a level of maturity in handling her role well . Every scene is enacted by her perfectly well. The music is okay, rather a few of the scenes in the film, one which shows the long winding roads of Darjeeling and another which shows the sprawling North Kolkata mansion in all it’s splendour look quite good.

1774803Bridget Jones  is frustrated: she is in her early thirties, still single, very accident prone and worried about her weight. She works in publicity at a book publishing company in London where her main focus is fantasizing about her boss, Daniel Cleaver . At a New Year party hosted by her parents, she re-meets Mark Darcy , the barrister son of her parents' friends. They had known each other as children. After their initial encounter, Mark thinks that Bridget is a fool and Bridget thinks that he is arrogant and rude, and is disgusted by his jumper with a huge reindeer. After a day beset by a series of mishaps, she misplaces her purse, breaks her coffee mug and gets stuck in a lift. When she returns home that evening, her shopping bags split. She reaches to pull the curtains, only for them to fall off the wall. That is the final straw of a stressful day. When she catches sight of her reflection in the window, she decides to turn her life around. She starts her own diary, which covers all her attempts to stop smoking, lose weight and find her Mr. Right. Bridget and Daniel begin to flirt heavily at work, first over email. After a book launch, they start a relationship, despite the fact that he is a notorious womanizer with a questionable personality, of which Bridget is aware, from when stating earlier in the film that she will not form relationships with alcoholics, workaholics, peeping-toms, megalomaniacs, or perverts. Bridget learns from Daniel that he and Mark have a history and, as a result, hate each other. Daniel informs Bridget of their falling-out, telling her that Mark broke their friendship by sleeping with his fiancée. Daniel's dubious character becomes clearer and clearer to Bridget and she eventually breaks off their relationship when she catches him with another woman, a colleague of his, Lara . After a spectacular departure from the office, in which Daniel's desperate attempts to make Bridget stay spark the comment ""I'd rather have a job wiping Saddam Hussein's arse"", she finds a new job in television. She and Mark have run-ins at a bed and breakfast and at a mutual friend's dinner party. During the party, Mark, who has come to the dinner with his colleague, Natasha , privately confesses to Bridget that, despite her faults, he likes her ""just the way she is"". He later helps Bridget to achieve an important interview for work, in which her quirky approach prompts the classic comment ""Bridget Jones - already a legend"". She begins to develop feelings for Mark. Just as Bridget and Mark's mutual attraction comes together at a birthday dinner party hosted by Bridget, Daniel comes back, temporarily claiming Bridget's attention. Mark originally leaves the party, but returns to face Daniel. Mark punches Daniel and the two fight. They end up in a nearby restaurant and finally smash through the window, landing on the street. Mark wins the battle and knocks Daniel out. Bridget chides Mark but afterwards, after an insensitive appeal by Daniel, she says emphatically that she doesn't want to be with him. Bridget learns the truth about Mark and Daniel's falling-out after her mother lets it out in conversation - that it was actually Daniel who had seduced Mark's wife . At a dinner party the same day, Bridget confesses her feelings for Mark, only to find out that he and Natasha are both leaving to accept jobs in New York. Bridget interrupts the toast to their pending engagement with a halting but moving speech about England losing one of its finest men. Her words clearly have an effect on Mark, as he realises what she really means, but he still flies to New York, though with obvious misgivings. Just as Bridget starts to embark on a trip to Paris with her friends to mend her broken heart, Mark returns to stay with her. When they are about to kiss for the first time, Bridget goes to her bedroom to change her undergarments, remarking that this is ""an occasion for genuinely tiny knickers."" While Bridget is changing, Mark peeks at her diary, in which she has written many insults about him. Bridget returns to find that he has left. Realizing that he had read her diary and that she might potentially lose him again, Bridget runs outside after him in a thin sweater and zebra skin-print underwear. Unable to find him and disheartened, she is about to return home when Mark appears holding a new diary, ""to make a fresh start"". They kiss in the snow-covered streets and the film closes.

2900798The film continues the story from the original movie's conclusion. The Poseidon is still afloat, and the six survivors of Reverend Scott's team have been rescued. Cockney tugboat captain, Mike Turner , discovers the wreck of the ship. Accompanied by second mate Wilbur  and passenger Celeste Whitman , he heads out to claim salvage rights on it, as the tugboat Jenny lost her cargo in the same storm that capsized it. They are soon followed by Dr. Stefan Svevo  and his crew, who claim to be Greek Orthodox medics who received the ship's SOS. They board the doomed vessel and become trapped after the entrance collapses. The group with Turner also encounters the ship's nurse, Gina Rowe, a passenger named Suzanne Constantine, and war veteran Frank Mezzetti who is searching for his missing daughter , which they soon find along with the elevator operator Larry Simpson and as well as a ""billionaire"" named ""Tex"". Later they find the blind Harold Meredith and his wife Hannah, who were waiting for rescue. Water continues to submerge more decks and more explosions occur. Turner and his group find the purser's office, where Svevo decides that he and his men will continue their search for other survivors. Turner agrees and Svevo and his men leave in another direction. Another explosion causes the safe in the purser's office to fall through the floor and open, revealing gold coins  and cash. Turner and Wilbur excitedly gather it and start looking for another way out of the ship. Unknown to Turner and the survivors, Suzanne was actually working with Svevo and sneaked a list containing information about a cargo of crates from the purser's office. She gives it to Svevo, but decides that she doesn't want to go through with his plan anymore. Svevo apologizes and orders Doyle, one of his men to kill Suzanne. He shoots her, but she strikes him with an axe before she dies. After climbing up a few decks, Turner and his group find Svevo and his men gathering a cargo of plutonium. Svevo reveals that his real intention of boarding the Poseidon was to retrieve his lost shipment of plutonium, adding that he can't let Turner and his group go now. However, before they can kill Turner and his group, another explosion occurs, allowing them to escape through another cargo room full of cars, where another of Svevo's men is killed. Water floods the deck as Turner's group proceed to up to the next deck, but Hannah falls into the rising water and Turner loses his salvaged gold. Svevo and his one remaining gunman head back up to the ship's stern, where the rest of Svevo's team attempt to raise the plutonium using a crane up to the hull of the ship, which is still above water but is slowly sinking. In another section of the ship, Turner and the survivors exit the ship through an underwater side door, but due to shortage of scuba tanks, Wilbur  sacrifices himself by swimming underwater and disappearing. Turner and Celeste swim to the tugboat Jenny and move it closer to the Poseidon as the remaining survivors swim towards it. Svevo's men see them and open fire and kill Tex, who willingly holds onto a bottle of champagne as he goes down. Turner's group makes it to his boat and they sail away. Water continues to flood the Poseidon and cause the on-board boilers to explode, which causes the cargo of plutonium to also do so. The Poseidon completely explodes, killing Svevo and his men. On board Turner's boat, Turner accepts that his tugboat Jenny will be taken from him when they get to port, but Celeste reveals a diamond that she salvaged from the Poseidon. Celeste asks Turner, ""Are you going to kiss me now?"" and Turner replies, ""I was going to kiss you anyway."" They kiss and the tugboat Jenny sails away into the sunset with the survivors.
219712Alex Browning, a senior high school student, boards Volée Airlines Flight 180 with his classmates and teachers for their senior trip from John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City to Charles de Gaulle International Airport in Paris. Before the plane takes off, Alex has a premonition that the flight will explode, killing everyone on board. As events from his vision express themselves in reality, he panics and attempts to stop the flight. The resulting commotion leads to the removal of some passengers, including Alex, orphan Clear Rivers, Alex' best friend Tod Waggner, teacher Valerie Lewton, Alex's rival Carter Horton, Carter's girlfriend Terry Chaney and student Billy Hitchcock. After they have been removed from the plane, none of the passengers believe Alex's statement until the airliner explodes in fire. The survivors are devastated and are investigated by two FBI agents who are particularly interested in Alex's vision. After attending a memorial for the Volée Airlines Flight 180 victims, Tod accidentally hangs himself within his clothesline and is deemed a suicide. When Alex and Clear locate his body, mortician William Bludworth tells them that Death is reclaiming the lives of those who escaped its original plan, as is proven when Terry is hit by a speeding bus. While watching a newsfeed detailing Volée Airlines Flight 180's aftermath, Alex concludes that Death is killing the survivors in accordance with the sequence of their intended demises on the plane. Nonetheless, he is too late to save Ms Lewton from a kitchen knife impalement which ultimately causes a house explosion. The remaining survivors  are reunited as Alex explains the situation. Frustrated by Terry's loss and at having no control over his life, Carter attempts suicide by stalling his car on the railroad tracks. Though he changes his mind, Alex rescues him by ripping his seatbelt before the train collides with his car. However, Billy is unexpectedly decapitated by shrapnel from the wreckage. Withdrawing himself from the group, Alex believes that Death skipped Carter and progressed to Billy. Realizing Clear is actually next rather than himself, Alex rushes to her aid and encounters the FBI agents along the way. Meanwhile, Clear is trapped inside her vehicle, surrounded by loose live wires. Alex sacrifices himself on behalf of her safety by grabbing the wires, initiating an explosion which incapacitates him and the screen fades to white. Six months later, Alex, Clear and Carter arrive in Paris and discuss their survival. Fearing that their struggle is unfinished, Alex narrowly avoids a bus. The bus hurls a parking signage towards a neon sign, which descends on Alex. Carter tackles Alex in time and asks him about the next victim, inadvertently standing in the way of the swinging neon sign as the credits roll implying Alex and Clear as the remaining survivors of the Volée Airlines Flight 180.

On the eve of the scheduled execution, Temple tries to save Nancy by telling her father, the governor, of the events leading up to the murder. Six years earlier, Temple was a pleasure-loving college girl carrying on a flirtatious romance with young Gowan Stevens. One night, Gowan got drunk and took her to a backwoods still where she was raped by Candy Man, a Cajun bootlegger. The next morning, although in a state of semi-shock, she willingly submitted to more of his lovemaking, and then agreed to live with him in a New Orleans brothel. Nancy became her personal maid, and Temple reveled in her new life, until Candy Man was reported killed in an auto accident and Temple was forced to go home. Marriage to Gowan followed; but for Temple it was a dull life, and she hired Nancy as a servant to remind her of the brothel life she had loved so much. Suddenly, Candy Man returned, and Temple decided to abandon her home and marriage and once more run off with him. To bring Temple to her senses and prevent her from ruining her life, Nancy sacrificed the infant child by smothering it to death.

As the two women beg each other's forgiveness, Temple realizes that it is only through Nancy's sacrifice that she has been able to find salvation.

Sir Richard throws his son out and storms off in a rage. Shortly afterwards, Richard Junior finds his biological father dead in the forest. Only the viewer and an unidentified witness know that Lord Bellasis has actually been killed by his own son, known as John Rex. However, it is Richard Devine who is found next to the body and arrested. Thinking that his father killed Bellasis, Richard wants to protect his mother's reputation and gives his name as Rufus Dawes. The convict ship that brings Dawes to Tasmania also carries the new governor Vickers and his wife and his daughter Sylvia. The commander of the ship is a brutal man by the name of Maurice Frere. With the Vickers is a young girl, Sarah Purfoy, as a nurse to the child. However, she really is the fiancée of John Rex, convicted for forgery, and tries to help the convicts take the ship. The rebellion is led by a murderer named Gabbett. They fail when Dawes overhears their plans and manages to warn an officer while being brought to a quarantine room for the sick. Gabbett decides to claim that Dawes was the actual ringleader. A few years later, Frere comes to visit Vickers and shows interest in Sylvia who has grown to be a beautiful young woman. Gabbett has come back after an escape and hints that he cannibalised his comrades to survive. Dawes, who is kept in solitary confinement on an island before the coast, attempts to drown himself. Frere has brought Vickers the order to give up the settlement and move to Port Arthur. Vickers embarks the convicts and sails with them. A smaller boat is supposed to carry Frere, Mrs Vickers and Sylvia, but is taken by John Rex, who maroons the three on the abandoned shore. There, Dawes finds them a few days later and manages to inspire them a new will to live. Sylvia especially takes to him very much and convinces him to make a boat, but Mrs Vickers dies before they can leave and makes Dawes promise to look after her daughter. The three survivors are found later by Vickers who has started to search for them. Frere takes the credit for saving Sylvia, who is herself unable to remember a thing after waking. Dawes is put back into prison. Later again, it is shortly before the wedding of Sylvia and Frere. John Rex has been captured and Sarah Purfoy begs Frere to save his life by saying that he left them food and weapons. She threatens to reveal his past with some of the women in the settlement to Sylvia and Frere complies. Dawes, who also testifies, is shocked to find that Sylvia cannot remember him.

When he arrives at the shore, he is found by a group of sailors, who kill him. Rex reads Dawes letter in Sydney and understands his striking resemblance to Dawes, since they have the same father. He returns to England, where Ellinor Devine first accepts him as her son, but begins to suspect once he starts spending the family fortune. She confronts him with the fact that Richard was illegitimate, and Rex confesses to what happened. Some years later again, Dawes is on Norfolk Island. Frere is on his way there to restore order.

One evening, he finds North and Sylvia in an embrace and suspects his wife to cheat on him. After he strikes her, Sylvia takes the next boat to the mainland; to her father. North goes to visit Dawes and confesses to him that he witnessed the murder of Lord Bellasis but did not tell anyone because Lord Bellasis held banknotes that North had forged.

During his tour of the prison, an accident occurs that knocks him unconscious. He is rushed to the empty but visibly haunted walls of cell 211. As this diversion unfolds, convicts break free and hijack control of the penitentiary. Aware of the violence that is to come, the prison officers flee, leaving Juan stranded and unconscious in the heart of the riot. When Juan awakens, he immediately takes stock of the situation; in order to survive, he must pretend to be a prisoner. Juan manages to convince the other prisoners that he is one of them, and that he just entered the prison that very day for homicide. He not only makes himself believed as inmate, but befriends the violent, deep voiced leader of the riot, Malamadre , who takes him under his wing. Malamadre discovers that Basque terrorists associated with ETA are being held in the same prison, and plans to use them as a bargaining tool. When this hits the news, it triggers a stream of prison riots throughout the country as well as demonstrations in the Basque Country. Juan quickly realizes that he is on his own as the situation becomes more politicized and the government gets involved, afraid of potential ramifications in the Basque community. Juan's pregnant wife, Elena, slowly learns about his impossible situation and heads for the jail. Once there she is brutally beaten outside the prisons, while trying to get information about her husband. A TV inside the prison cell block reveals the information to the prisoners. Camera footage indicates that Elena was at the riot. Fearful for her safety, Juan insists on learning information regarding her status. Malamadre demands information of all those injured by the riot. The authorities respond with a short list of only four names. This infuriates the prisoners, who believe that the police are withholding information, and decide to kill one of the ETA prisoners. However, Juan intervenes and suggest they merely cut off an ear, an act he is forced to perform himself. The authorities then provide additional information on all the injured. Juan learns Elena is in the hospital, though he is told she is recovering. Juan insists on talking to her but is rebuffed. Utrilla, the police guard who hit Elena, is suspended and asked to leave. Meanwhile, Apache learns the truth behind Juan's status as a guard, having contacted a friend at the police via a secret cell phone. He tells Juan he will give Juan a chance to defend himself before letting Malamadre know. Later, Malamadre has Apache tell Juan that he needs to speak to him. Juan is brought to a secluded room, the door closed behind him, and several of Malamadre's men surround him. He asks, nervously, ""What faces?"" in an effort to defuse the situation given his worry that Apache betrayed his true status. Instead, Malamadre shows Juan a cell phone video from a different camera at the outside riot. The footage shows that Elena was beaten by Utrilla, another prison guard, who then proceeded to leave her on the ground. Juan insists that Utrilla be brought inside. Inside, Utrilla is faced with the cell phone footage by an infuriated Juan. Juan again insists on talking to Elena, but he instead learns that both she and her unborn child have died. In response, the prisoners viciously beat Utrilla until he loudly insists that Juan is a prison guard. He asks Juan to tell the truth; instead, Juan slits Utrilla's throat and fully joins the prisoners in their fight, having lost all will and reason for life outside. In private Malamadre and his other cohorts are furious but Malamadre leaves him alone, given that he ruthlessly killed Utrilla. Juan proceeds to his cell and attempts to commit suicide by hanging himself with a belt. He fails as the belt breaks under his weight. Malamadre receives a call from the negotiator asking him to collect a file. They tell him that Juan Oliver is a prison guard and leave the file for Malamadre to see. Malamadre says it is only a piece of paper and heads back inside telling the negotiator that they are just trying to make him kill Juan. The government sends a messenger to deal directly.

During his tour of the prison, an accident occurs that knocks him unconscious. He is rushed to the empty but visibly haunted walls of cell 211. As this diversion unfolds, convicts break free and hijack control of the penitentiary. Aware of the violence that is to come, the prison officers flee, leaving Juan stranded and unconscious in the heart of the riot. When Juan awakens, he immediately takes stock of the situation; in order to survive, he must pretend to be a prisoner. Juan manages to convince the other prisoners that he is one of them, and that he just entered the prison that very day for homicide. He not only makes himself believed as inmate, but befriends the violent, deep voiced leader of the riot, Malamadre , who takes him under his wing. Malamadre discovers that Basque terrorists associated with ETA are being held in the same prison, and plans to use them as a bargaining tool. When this hits the news, it triggers a stream of prison riots throughout the country as well as demonstrations in the Basque Country. Juan quickly realizes that he is on his own as the situation becomes more politicized and the government gets involved, afraid of potential ramifications in the Basque community. Juan's pregnant wife, Elena, slowly learns about his impossible situation and heads for the jail. Once there she is brutally beaten outside the prisons, while trying to get information about her husband. A TV inside the prison cell block reveals the information to the prisoners. Camera footage indicates that Elena was at the riot. Fearful for her safety, Juan insists on learning information regarding her status. Malamadre demands information of all those injured by the riot. The authorities respond with a short list of only four names. This infuriates the prisoners, who believe that the police are withholding information, and decide to kill one of the ETA prisoners. However, Juan intervenes and suggest they merely cut off an ear, an act he is forced to perform himself. The authorities then provide additional information on all the injured. Juan learns Elena is in the hospital, though he is told she is recovering. Juan insists on talking to her but is rebuffed. Utrilla, the police guard who hit Elena, is suspended and asked to leave. Meanwhile, Apache learns the truth behind Juan's status as a guard, having contacted a friend at the police via a secret cell phone. He tells Juan he will give Juan a chance to defend himself before letting Malamadre know. Later, Malamadre has Apache tell Juan that he needs to speak to him. Juan is brought to a secluded room, the door closed behind him, and several of Malamadre's men surround him. He asks, nervously, ""What faces?"" in an effort to defuse the situation given his worry that Apache betrayed his true status. Instead, Malamadre shows Juan a cell phone video from a different camera at the outside riot. The footage shows that Elena was beaten by Utrilla, another prison guard, who then proceeded to leave her on the ground. Juan insists that Utrilla be brought inside. Inside, Utrilla is faced with the cell phone footage by an infuriated Juan. Juan again insists on talking to Elena, but he instead learns that both she and her unborn child have died. In response, the prisoners viciously beat Utrilla until he loudly insists that Juan is a prison guard. He asks Juan to tell the truth; instead, Juan slits Utrilla's throat and fully joins the prisoners in their fight, having lost all will and reason for life outside. In private Malamadre and his other cohorts are furious but Malamadre leaves him alone, given that he ruthlessly killed Utrilla. Juan proceeds to his cell and attempts to commit suicide by hanging himself with a belt. He fails as the belt breaks under his weight. Malamadre receives a call from the negotiator asking him to collect a file. They tell him that Juan Oliver is a prison guard and leave the file for Malamadre to see.

After the performance Bergen hosts an engagement party for Julie and his business partner, Jerry Wood. The next day, Bergen flies his new plane and he and Charlie are set for their summer vacation. En route, Bergen gets lost and lands in Wistful Vista, home of Fibber McGee and Molly. Bergen's almost crash landing interrupts a meeting with Wistful Vista's Chamber of Commerce. Fibber, president, has just proposed the selling of the town's airstrip to Hilary Horton, owner of the Horton Aircraft Factory. The Commerce and townspeople thought Bergen's plane was carrying Horton. Bergen and Charlie are welcomed to the town and Fibber and Molly invite them to stay at their home. Learning of Fibber's plans, Bergen offers to convince Hilary, his friend, to build his factory at Wistful Vista. Throckmorton P. Gildersleeve , secretly working for Ironton Realty, a rival company wanting to purchase Horton's factory, gets a scoop of Fibber and Bergen's plans. He goes to Sam Cudahy, owner of Ironton Realty, planning to back out of Cudahy's schemes. Threatened by blackmail, Gildersleeve tricks Fibber into paying for an elaborate luncheon to honor their guest. Gildersleeve's trickery continues when he meets Charlie McCarthy, who is fed up staying at Wistful Vista and wants to find a way to leave town. Gildersleeve suggests that Charlie sends a fake telegram to Bergen saying that his former assistant, Julie Patterson, is ill. Charlie does and on the day Bergen is to fly Hilary Horton to Wistful Vista, he receives the telegram, thus suddenly changing his plans. Bergen arrives back in New York, discovering Julie is well. He then quickly returns to Wistful Vista with a protesting Julie in tow. Bergen's business partner, Jerry, with his former fiancée and Julie's replacement, Marge, search for Julie. Meanwhile, Fibber, humiliated, resigned from the Chamber of Commerce and has been notified that his house is in foreclosure and the airstrip has been purchased by Cudahy. Charlie confesses to Julie that Gildersleeve suggested sending the fake telegram. Julie then devises a scheme to foil Cudahy into investing in some worthless land belonging to Fibber and for Gildersleeve to trade his land for the airstrip. Bergen successfully convinces Hilary to fly into Wistful Vista. Meanwhile, Jerry and Marge, still searching for Julie, have decided that they are still in love and get married. Back at the McGees', Molly discovers that Julie is in love with Bergen and advises her to ""sabotage"" him into marriage. Everyone drives to the airstrip to meet Horton. As Fibber and Molly wait in Bergen's plane, he and Julie greet Jerry and Marge, who have just driven into town. When Fibber accidentally takes off, Julie and Bergen follow in another plane. Horton's plane is also coming and Fibber nearly crashes into him. Bergen climbs aboard the plane, and safely lands Fibber and Molly. After returning to the McGee house, Jerry and Marge announce their marriage. At that moment, Horton arrives and informs Bergen that he owns a controlling interest in the Horton company and can build a factory wherever he desires.

Discouraged, the McGees decide to have their own celebration—to relive their first honeymoon night at the Ramble Inn. Fibber and Molly are again discouraged upon finding that the inn has gone to ruin. Still, they decide to stay the night. The next morning, the McGees leave Ramble Inn and Fibber insists, despite their finances, that they head to Lake Arcadia and spend at least one night at the Silver Tip Lodge. As Fibber checks into the lodge Molly bumps into her old beau, Otis Cadwalader . When Fibber, naturally jealous, has to be cordial to Cadwalader, he replies, ""I've got bad news for you...I'm fine!"" Also at the lodge, the McGees meet up with some old acquaintances: ventriloquist Edgar Bergen, his puppet, Charlie McCarthy, Throckmorton P. Gildersleeve  and Abigail Uppington . Fibber, not admitting he is broke, rents the bridal suite and chooses to have their once cancelled anniversary party held at the lodge. Still in the lobby, Cadwalader asks Fibber and offers to pay him if he can convince Bergen to invest in a synthetic gasoline formula developed by inventor Wallace Wimple . Fibber is able to visit Wimple and see his formula in action; he agrees to partner with Cadwalader. Meanwhile, Bergen and Charlie have been asked by an institute to find a rare silk-spinning moth. During a search, they are met by Gildersleeve's sister, Jean , and her troop of girl guides. Bergen successfully finds a specimen and rushes back to the lodge to phone the institute, leaving Charlie to flirt with the girls. At the McGee's party that night, Fibber arranged for bandleader Ray Noble to provide the musical accompaniment. Charlie continues romancing the girl guides and Fibber talks to Bergen about Cadwalader's scheme. Bergen agrees to write Fibber a check on the condition that it not be cashed until he has a chance to investigate Cadwalader. As soon as Bergen leaves, however, Cadwalader snatches the check out of Fibber's hands. As the party progresses, Abigail Uppington, dressed as an Indian, begins to recite ""The Song of Hiawatha."" Bergen notices a branch Uppington has clutched in her hand. It is covered with silkworm cocoons. Bergen asked where to find those branches; he is directed by puppet Mortimer Snerd, to an Indian reservation. Bergen sneaks into the reservation as an Indian squaw, and Charlie as his papoose. When the Indians threaten Bergen, he uses his ventriloquism to throw his voice at a totem pole. The chief of the tribe is fearfully impressed at the speaking totem. As Bergen searches for the cocoons, Charlie makes advances to the other Indian squaws, angering the Indians. Fleeing from the reservation, Bergen and Charlie return to their laboratory with the cocoons. Back at the Silver Tip Lodge, Fibber tells Molly about his business deal with Cadwalader. However, when Wimple confides that his formula doesn't work, Molly approaches Cadwalader about returning Bergen's money. Meanwhile, Bergen informs Jean of his disappointment when he discovers that the cocoons are too brittle to unweave. Soon after, Fibber arrives with a sample of the formula and the bad news about Wimple's discovery. In the rush of everything that is happening, Charlie accidentally spills the formula on the cocoons. To their delight, Jean and Bergen discover that the formula releases the silk threads. Returning to the lodge, Bergen, Jean, Charlie and Fibber learn that Molly has driven off in a carriage with Cadwalader. Bergen and Fibber pursue the carriage on a wagon loaded with dynamite while Jean and Charlie follow by car. The chase ends when Molly pulls the carriage off the road, and the wagon is caught on a cliff. All ends happily as Bergen offers to buy the formula, Molly tells Fibber that she wasn't running away with Cadwalader but was driving him out of town to avoid a scandal. Molly and Fibber, Jean and Bergen embrace to the sound of exploding dynamite, leaving Charlie to say, ""Wow!...Anybody wanna adopt an orphan?"""

The queen gives birth to a daughter named Snow White, but dies soon after. The king mourns her, but in time, he remarries because of the pleading of his people. His new Queen is a beautiful, but evil woman who soon becomes jealous of Snow White's beauty. On her 17th birthday, Snow White's father dies and the wicked queen immediately imprisons her. Eventually, the queen's jealousy of her stepdaughter becomes so great that she orders her killed. Snow White escapes her hired assassin and finds refuge in the empty cottage of the seven dwarfs, soon to be joined by the Three Stooges, who are traveling to the castle with their ward Quatro. But the boy they have raised since childhood  is in reality Prince Charming, who though he has lost his memory, is betrothed to Snow White. Snow White and the Prince fall in love, but the queen has him kidnapped when she suspects his true identity. The Stooges, disguised as cooks, attempt to rescue him, but he falls from a staircase in the palace and is presumed dead. Meanwhile, the queen learns from her magic mirror that Snow White is still alive. With the help of her magician, Count Oga, she transforms herself into a witch and succeeds in getting Snow White to take a bite from a poisoned apple.  As she rides back to the palace, she encounters the Stooges, and thanks to an inadvertent wish they make on a magic sword , she crashes her broom into a mountainside and falls to her death. The Stooges then find the poisoned Snow White, but they do not bury her. Instead, they place her on a bed, and pray to her each day. Meanwhile, the Prince  has not died from his fall. Instead, he is saved by a group of men who want to revolt against the Evil Queen's rule over Fortunia. As the prince recovers, he realizes that his memory has returned, and so he knows that he is indeed a Prince, and that Snow White is the princess he was destined to marry. After leading a successful revolt which places him on the throne of Fortunia, the prince sends out searchers to find Snow White and the Stooges, unaware that, thanks to yet another inadvertent wish on Count Oga's sword, they are no longer in the country of Fortunia. All searches are fruitless, and Prince Charming is close to giving up hope when he learns of the Evil Queen's magic mirror. The mirror responds truthfully to the desperate Prince's pleas, and the Prince sets off on his journey. He arrives at the Stooges' cabin just in time to dispel the effects of the poisoned apple. Snow White and Prince Charming are married and live happily ever after.

At a convention in San Francisco, he mistakes Clarissa Standish, the mayor of Wenonah, Maine, for a ""balloon dancer"" he was expecting. A former longshoreman, Steve feels that Clarissa might be too refined a woman for him, but he's definitely attracted. He needs to be careful, however, because a crooked city councilman would love to have any hint of scandal to use against Steve politically back home. Steve proceeds to inadvertently get Clarissa arrested twice, first after a brawl in a Chinatown restaurant, then on their way to a costume party. A photographer clicks a picture of Clarissa making it appear she's at the police station for public drunkenness. She doesn't think it funny, but her uncle, Judge Standish, is privately delighted that the prim Clarissa seems to finally be loosening up. The balloon dancer, Sheila, shows up, causing Clarissa to conclude incorrectly that Steve's going to see her. And she's irate when Steve disappears, unaware that he had to hurry home for a hastily called council vote. The truth is, Steve wants to marry Clarissa, and can't wait to present her with the key to his city."

After killing three drifters who try to rob him, he takes their clothes, weapons and a horse. He wanders into the small town of Absolution, where the local preacher, Meacham , treats his wound. After the stranger subdues Percy Dolarhyde , a volatile drunk who has been terrorizing the town, Sheriff Taggart  recognizes the stranger as Jake Lonergan, a wanted outlaw, and attempts to arrest him. Jake beats up the posse sent to take him in and nearly escapes, but a mysterious woman named Ella Swenson  knocks him out. Percy's father, Colonel Woodrow Dolarhyde , a wealthy and ruthless cattleman, arrives with his men and demands that Percy be released. He sees Jake and also demands he be released to him, since Jake was the one who stole Dolarhyde's gold. During the standoff, alien craft begin attacking the town. Percy, the sheriff and many other townsfolk are grabbed by long, whip-like feelers hanging from the bottom of the alien ships and are abducted. Jake's shackle unfolds and becomes a weapon, shooting down one of the ships with a single shot, ending the attack. Dolarhyde, Ella, and other townsfolk form a posse to track an injured alien that escaped from the downed ship. Jake, meanwhile, travels to an abandoned cabin, and in a flashback, recalls returning there with the gold just before he and a woman, Alice , were abducted by the aliens. His memories returning, Jake joins up with the posse. During the night, while they camp in an upside down paddlewheel steamboat, the alien they were tracking kills Meacham, who sacrifices himself to save Emmett , Taggart's grandson. By the next morning, most of the posse has deserted, and the others are attacked by Jake's former gang. Jake, who stole the gang's loot after their last heist, attempts to retake control, but fails. As he and the others flee, the aliens begin attacking again and Ella is captured. Jake jumps aboard the ship and attacks the alien pilot, causing the ship to crash, but Ella is fatally wounded. Quite shortly after the crash, however, the posse is captured by Chiricahua Apache Indians, who blame them for the alien attacks. As Ella's body is dumped on a fire by a Chiricahua warrior, she is fully resurrected. Ella reveals herself to be an alien who traveled to Earth to help resist the invaders after they destroyed her homeworld. The aliens, who have been abducting humans to perform experiments, are also mining gold to power their machines. They are not invulnerable, however: Jake's gauntlet weapon can kill them, as well as stabbing and shooting them, though the creatures are far stronger and more durable than humans and have superior weapons. Ella claims Jake holds the secret to the aliens' whereabouts and says they must stop them before they exterminate all life on the planet. After taking medicine offered by the Apaches, Jake recalls that Alice was euthanized after she was used in an alien experiment, but he escaped, inadvertently stealing the alien weapon in the form of a gauntlet. He could also remember the location of the aliens' base of operations. Armed with this knowledge, the group, now led by Dolarhyde, prepares to attack the aliens' grounded mothership. Jake returns to his old gang and persuades them to join the fight. In a sneak attack, the humans breach the spaceship by destroying the shuttle bay, forcing the aliens into a ground battle. Jake and Ella board the ship and free the captives, but Jake is captured. Dolarhyde rescues him and both men escape the ship after killing the alien responsible for Alice's death. As the remaining aliens are taking off in their damaged craft, Ella sacrifices herself, destroying the ship using Jake's gauntlet. Jake's memory partially returns, and some abducted townsfolk begin to remember their past. Still a wanted man, Jake decides to leave; the sheriff and Dolarhyde say they will claim that he was killed in the invasion. The citizens intend to rebuild the town with the expectation that the newly discovered gold mine will soon bring many new settlers. Jake kindly rejects Dolarhyde's offer to help rebuild the town, and rides away.

Watney insists on accompanying Cabot to his next drinking spot, and during the car journey Cabot's ring activates and transports both him and Watney to Gor. Cabot is overjoyed at the thought of being reunited with his lover Talena, and the townspeople of Koruba are similarly overjoyed at Cabot's return. After fending off a brief attack by slavers, Cabot meets Talena, and also discovers that her father, King Marlenus is now married to an ambitious woman named Lara. At a feast that night, Marlenus announces that he will soon step down from the throne, and names Cabot to succeed him. Lara desires the throne herself, and gets the high priest Xenos to agree to help assassinate Marlenus. She then recruits the easily-persuaded Watney to provide her with an alibi, and proceeds to kill Marlenus, framing Cabot for the murder. While Cabot protests his innocence, and Talena believes him, the guards capture her, and Cabot is forced to flee along with his diminutive sidekick, Hup. Recognising the danger that Cabot represents, Lara and Xenos hire a ""Hunter"" to pursue and capture him. In the meantime, Lara betrays Watney and has him thrown in the dungeon, and attempts to have Talena killed by putting her in a fight with two female gladiators, only for Talena to easily triumph. In the desert, Cabot and Hup two encounter another band of slavers, and after attacking their encampment, rescue a female slave. That night the Hunter finds Cabot, Hup and the freed slave, and captures them while they sleep. Upon being brought back to Koruba, the three are thrown into the dungeon by Lara, despite Xenos's attempts to persuade her that even being held hostage, Cabot is too dangerous to be left alive. Xenos attempts to persuade Cabot to return to Earth, and Lara tries seducing him, but both attempts are unsuccessful, as Cabot is now determined to bring them to justice over Marlenus's death. The alliance between Lara and Xenos breaks down, with the former becoming frustrated at Xenos's lack of loyalty, and the latter realising just how disastrous it would be for Lara to rule Koruba, which leads to the two double-crossing and attempting to kill each other, though Lara's attempt ends up being the successful one. The following day, Cabot, Talena, Hup and Watney are brought outside the castle for a ceremonial execution. However, the four repeatedly fight off their executioners, until Lara sends in her entire guard and the Hunter, rapidly overwhelming the four. As the Hunter prepares to strike the death blow on Cabot, Watney reveals that Lara was the actual killer of Marlenus; the Hunter believes this without question and throws a spear at Lara, immediately killing her. With Cabot and Talena now crowned King and Queen respectively, they prepare to finally consummate their relationship. However, Cabot's ring then starts glowing, causing him to be worried that he's about to be sent back to Earth.

A car with a large black ace  is put on his chest. Another “Black Ace” victim. The killer sends his victims a Black Ace card, warning them they are to die and then kills them, his way of taunting the police. Neil Broderick, an author, intends writing a book about him and is on his way to see Thornton Drake to get more information about him. Austin Winters is his secretary and Neil met his daughter Martha on the train, on the way to Chicago. Drake has just received a Black Ace, with the words: “At seven tomorrow night”, the time he is to be killed. Two plainclothes cops arrive from police headquarters, having had a call, Clancy and Dugan . Martha suggests that they leave for Drake’s Louisiana plantation tomorrow morning and be far away from there at seven tomorrow night. Drake agrees and suggests they all go. On the flight, the lights go off for some seconds and when they come on again, Austin Winters is dead without a mark on him. At the plantation, Clancy ineptly questions the suspects till Neil points out that they are now in another state, so out of their jurisdiction. Neil goes to another room and makes a phone call, then signals to someone outside. After he finishes his call, the line is cut. Meanwhile one of the pilots has taken off in the plane, leaving the other pilot, Henderson, behind who claims he does not know anything though he was out of the cockpit when Winters was killed. The coroner finds a letter on the dead man which is to be read if Winters dies. It will reveal the identity of the Black Ace. Clancy starts reading it aloud and unsurprisingly the lights go off and the letter has vanished when the lights are turned on again. People locked in their rooms that night and Neil has a hidden car outside signal to him. Later that night, the coroner turns up, the real one. Neil goes to Martha’s room and asks her what she did with the letter, guessing that she had taken it because was afraid her father might implicate himself with the Black Ace. The letter is gone from where she hid it and all there is, is two sheets of plain paper and a Black Ace card. Clancy and Dugan appear and blame Neil. Clancy and Neil at gunpoint go to Drake’s room and while Clancy is hurling accusations, there is a groan from next door and they find a dead man there . A search of Neil reveals he has a skeleton key so might have been able to enter the dead man’s room. Downstairs, Dugan has been talking to Martha with his back to her, turns and sees she has gone . The housekeeper  is seen leading the fake coroner  who is carrying Martha. Drake left with Neil threatens him with a gun, demanding Winters’ confession but Neil has signalled Simons  who disarms Drake who has Winters’ confession implicating him. However, the gardener  comes into the room with a gun in his hand and now the villains have the upper hand till there is a knock at just the right moment. Two fights ensue. In trying to kill Simons, Pompey kills Drake with the hidden spike in the walking stick. Pompey is subdued and the two cops arrive to take the credit.

Jamie insists that John accompany her to a party the following night and try to cheer up. At the party, John tries various conversational tactics with different women, failing to spark a connection each time. He gets progressively drunker until he ends up urinating in the bushes, where Molly  compliments him on his penis and strikes up a conversation.

Deepti enthusiastically begins to coach Shikha for her husband's film &mdash; so much so that Shikha becomes even more like the young woman Deepti used to be and, as a result, the aging Aniket falls in love with Shikha, a woman as young as his son, despite the sadness and trouble it brings to his family.

To him, she was Sreemoti, the name which he had first given to Deepti. Deepti later gave this name to Shikha. Even when Sikha became popular in the acting world by the name Sreemoti, Aniket always referred to her as Sikha. For him, Deepti - his wife was the real Sreemoti.

It transforms her heart into a stone and puts her under a queer curse. She is to be the evil Countess of Stones and live in a stone tower. If the greatest gem-cutter in the world brings the stone of Alatyr to life, though, she'll become the ruler of the world. The Stone Countess, now cruel and selfish, is fascinated with the idea. She starts searching for the best gem-cutters and forces them to work with Alatyr, so the magical stone would become a living thing. Neither of the gem-cutters succeeds, so she kills them. While being imprisoned in her tower, they work on a large book about the secrets of gem-cutting. Each of them edits the book, so it's later named ""the Book of Masters"". Meanwhile, the Countess creates a talking magic mirror, whom she treats like a soulless thing. Also, she makes a large army of stone soldiers - the Ardars. She often sends them to terrorize common people and to capture some of them to feed Baba Yaga, who's mostly a cannibal. The plot develops, picturing a young orphan Ivan, who lives in an ordinary village but dreams of becoming the world's best gem-cutter. His father had actually been kidnapped by the Stone Countess, and Ivan also secretly plans to avenge it. One day, he makes a sculpture of his landlord's daughter Clava, showing her fatness and ugliness in a grotesque way. The landlord, who adores his daughter, orders to punish Ivan severely. The execution doesn't even start before the village faces another attack of the Ardars, who capture Ivan and Clava and bring them to Baba Yaga. Baba Yaga goes to feed the Ardars, and Ivan and Clava are unexpectedly freed by a lovely young girl, who calls herself Katia, the Stone Countess's daughter. Clava takes the chance to run away from Baba Yaga's house, but Ivan is caught by Baba Yaga. She attempts to make a soup of him but is distracted again by Iangul, the Ardars' commander, who comes again to see Katia. Baba Yaga disapproves of it, so she goes to send him away. Katia hides Ivan and, when Iangul leaves and Baba Yaga goes to sleep, shows Ivan a passageway to the stone tower. One can enter it through a well if the Stone Countess allows. Ivan tells Katia of his dream to become a professional gem-cutter and avenge his father's death. So Katia gives him the Book of Masters to study but warns him about her mother's evil power. Ivan studies the Book for a year. He has fallen for Katia and misses her terribly. But the fat landlady Clava wants to marry him, being sure that he's her rescuer. Moreover, the Stone Countess orders Katia to marry Iangul . As for Ivan's ugly fiancee, she also has an admirer - Ivan's friend Cusma, a blacksmith. Finally, Ivan finishes studying the Book and goes to the stone tower. The Countess promises him Katia's hand in exchange for bringing Alatyr to life. Ivan believes her and soon carves the stone into a perfect shape of a red rose, and it becomes alive. But the Countess has tricked him. He sees Katia in a dream, and she tells him they'll never be together. Furious, Ivan runs to the forest where Baba Yaga lives to ask her for help. The Ardars are sent to kill him, but Cusma distracts them and they kill him instead. Searching for Baba Yaga's house, Ivan meets a helpful talking horse, frees a captured mermaid and helps a bored bogatyr. Finally he finds Baba Yaga, who tells him about magical diamonds able to cancel Alatyr's black powers. Also she gives him a bottle with the water of life, and Ivan revives Cusma. Then Baba Yaga's magic transport him to Koschei the Deathless, who is the owner of the magical diamonds. First Koschei refuses to give them to Ivan, but he is convinced to do this by his fiancee, the mermaid rescued by Ivan. So Ivan takes the diamonds and hurries to the tower, where Katia's soul is being given to Alatyr in order to make the stone fully alive. Ivan saves Katia and steals Alatyr just in time, and they rush to the passageway to the non-magical world. They are stopped by Iangul, who still hopes that Katia will be his wife. Katia's sure Iangul is going to kill Ivan, so she offers herself in exchange for Ivan's life. Realizing that Katia doesn't love him, Iangul lets both of them run away. The Stone Countess turns him into a stone when she finds out. But when the Countess catches Ivan and orders him to give her Alatyr back, Ivan is no longer afraid of her. He adorns Alatyr with the magical diamonds, and they break the spell that kept the Countess evil. So she's kind and sweet again and happily allows Katia to marry Ivan. The landlady Clava turns sad, because she wants to marry someone too. Her father says that he'll give her to anyone, and Cusma at last declares his love for Clava. The two couples are wedded and live happily ever after."

Foghorn is playing solitaire, and the Dawg approaches from behind with two large clash cymbals, striking them together twice, once over Foghorn's head and the second time with Foghorn's head in between. Foghorn counters by taking a pie from a nearby windowsill, then mashing it into Dawg's face . The Dawg, his face covered with cream, chases Foghorn but is strangled by his rope. Foghorn returns, and like a barber, uses a straight razor to remove the cream from the Dawg's face. The Dawg becomes incapacitated when Foghorn places a large metal pipe over his body. Foghorn then gets a scalding hot towel from a pot of boiling water and places in on the helpless Dawg's face. Henery enters the scene looking for a chicken. Henery approaches the Dawg, who is sharpening an ax on a grinder, and thinking the Dawg is a chicken tries to pull him from behind with the Dawg's neck rope. The Dawg explains that he is not a chicken, and then points to Foghorn who is in the distance. Henery starts out after Foghorn but the Dawg stops him and states that Henery has to out-trick Foghorn if he is going to catch him. Henery attracts Foghorn's attention by trying to secure a catapult with a large pumpkin on it. Foghorn helps Henery by securing the catapult for him, and as he walks away Henery launches the pumpkin at Foghorn, which hits him in the head. Henery tells Foghorn that he wants to capture him for dinner. Playing along, Foghorn replies that he is too old and tough to be used for dinner. Foghorn tells Henery that a better choice would be pheasant under glass. Henery, not knowing what pheasant is, asks Foghorn where he can find one. Foghorn naturally points to the Dawg's house, telling Henery that a pheasant lives inside. Foghorn provides Henery with a glass cover and Henery walks into the Dawg's house and places it over him. The Dawg runs out with the glass over him but is again constrained by his rope. With the Dawg temporarily immobile, Foghorn returns with a set of golf clubs, placing a golf ball on the Dawg's nose. Foghorn swings, but hits the Dawg instead of the ball, sending the Dawg  toward a tree. Foghorn then covers Henery with vanishing cream and Henery is led to believe that he is invisible. Henery, still under the impression that the Dawg is a pheasant, leaves in pursuit. The Dawg uses a mirror to prove to Henery that he is not really invisible and that he has been tricked again by Foghorn. The Dawg runs out of his house but is stopped by the rope again and Foghorn returns with an accordion which he stuffs over the Dawg's head while playing the instrument. Foghorn convinces Henery to resume his quest for the pheasant, citing historical episodes. The Dawg finally explains to Henery that as a chicken hawk he should be after chicken and asks Henery to unhook his from his rope. The Dawg lures Foghorn from hiding and they start a fight.

Foghorn is playing solitaire, and the Dawg approaches from behind with two large clash cymbals, striking them together twice, once over Foghorn's head and the second time with Foghorn's head in between. Foghorn counters by taking a pie from a nearby windowsill, then mashing it into Dawg's face . The Dawg, his face covered with cream, chases Foghorn but is strangled by his rope. Foghorn returns, and like a barber, uses a straight razor to remove the cream from the Dawg's face. The Dawg becomes incapacitated when Foghorn places a large metal pipe over his body. Foghorn then gets a scalding hot towel from a pot of boiling water and places in on the helpless Dawg's face. Henery enters the scene looking for a chicken. Henery approaches the Dawg, who is sharpening an ax on a grinder, and thinking the Dawg is a chicken tries to pull him from behind with the Dawg's neck rope. The Dawg explains that he is not a chicken, and then points to Foghorn who is in the distance. Henery starts out after Foghorn but the Dawg stops him and states that Henery has to out-trick Foghorn if he is going to catch him. Henery attracts Foghorn's attention by trying to secure a catapult with a large pumpkin on it. Foghorn helps Henery by securing the catapult for him, and as he walks away Henery launches the pumpkin at Foghorn, which hits him in the head. Henery tells Foghorn that he wants to capture him for dinner. Playing along, Foghorn replies that he is too old and tough to be used for dinner. Foghorn tells Henery that a better choice would be pheasant under glass. Henery, not knowing what pheasant is, asks Foghorn where he can find one. Foghorn naturally points to the Dawg's house, telling Henery that a pheasant lives inside. Foghorn provides Henery with a glass cover and Henery walks into the Dawg's house and places it over him. The Dawg runs out with the glass over him but is again constrained by his rope. With the Dawg temporarily immobile, Foghorn returns with a set of golf clubs, placing a golf ball on the Dawg's nose. Foghorn swings, but hits the Dawg instead of the ball, sending the Dawg  toward a tree. Foghorn then covers Henery with vanishing cream and Henery is led to believe that he is invisible. Henery, still under the impression that the Dawg is a pheasant, leaves in pursuit. The Dawg uses a mirror to prove to Henery that he is not really invisible and that he has been tricked again by Foghorn. The Dawg runs out of his house but is stopped by the rope again and Foghorn returns with an accordion which he stuffs over the Dawg's head while playing the instrument. Foghorn convinces Henery to resume his quest for the pheasant, citing historical episodes. The Dawg finally explains to Henery that as a chicken hawk he should be after chicken and asks Henery to unhook his from his rope. The Dawg lures Foghorn from hiding and they start a fight.

Jin-Er looks up to his brother, who is a champion runner at the local high school, earns top grades, is a talented musician, and is very popular; Jin-Er's parents and teachers often scold him for not being as good as his big brother. Desmond has a girlfriend, Fang Fei, who comes from a wealthy family, and whose family moves away to the United States to escape the ""lawless"" situation in Hong Kong. Desmond gradually becomes aware of the inequalities in Hong Kong society of that time, both through interactions with a cocky British policeman who extorts money from his father in exchange for letting them keep their shop  and through his first time seeing the inside of Fang Fei's family's mansion. Most of this is told through Jin-Er, the film's narrator. Not long before Fang Fei leaves, Desmond's grades start declining and he takes third place in a race he had hoped to win. One day he collapses suddenly after a typhoon nearly destroys the family's house, and his father takes him to the hospital, where he is diagnosed with leukemia. His parents search for a doctor who can cure him but find none, and his condition worsens until he has to remain in the hospital, where the nurses treat him poorly and extort money from his parents in exchange for basic care. Jin-Er, who spends much of his free time stealing trinkets around town, tries to offer them all to his brother in attempt to cheer him up, but Desmond doesn't accept any of them. Fang Fei returns from the United States and visits him in the hospital, where they share their first kiss, but Desmond dies shortly thereafter. Years later Jin-Er, narrating retrospectively, remarks that ""time is the greatest thief"".

The archaeologists identify it as being made by Mak-zi , an ancient Chinese philosopher who had invented many things, but were arguably ahead of its time - for example, a myriad of electronic devices before the discovery of electricity. However, the crudeness of the artifact has led to the artifact being rejected for every museum in China and abroad, and thus, unwilling to destroy it, the artifact was set on a barge, continuously moving along the Yangtze River. The story continues on to Mak-zi's descendant 18 generations later, McDull , a kindergartener living in Hong Kong. Due to mounting debts from failed ventures and economic hardships, McDull's mother, Mrs. Mak , decides to leave their home in Tai Kok Tsui to find fortune in the mainland. Arriving in Wuhan, Mrs. Mak, knowing that she cannot continue to take care of McDull while trying to make a living, decides to enroll McDull in the Spring Flowers Gate, a boarding Taoist martial arts academy in the Wudang Mountains, while she continues to ply her trade in Wuhan, Shanghai, Suzhou, and Hangzhou. McDull finds it hard to fit in, being ostracized by his peers at the academy due to being a Hong Konger. However, a mysterious Brother Panda  encourages him to get closer and make new friends with his peers. McDull eventually gets used to being liked by his friends, but when news of a prestigious martial arts competition, the International Kindergarten Martial Arts Competition, is to take place, nearly all of the students consider leaving the academy, McDull included. On the way down the mountain , McDull intends to call his mother to tell her that he was quitting the academy, but after a talk with the master's assistant , McDull learns about his master's plight: the headmaster had been a martial arts prodigy, mastering all forms of Chinese martial arts before the age of 20. When a published article by international action star Pruce Lee  that claims that Chinese martial arts was on decline and was more suited for show than actual combat, the headmaster had respectfully disagreed. A war of wards was exchanged, and the two agreed to a match together. However, because of the political situation in China at the time, the battle, which would be later known as ""The Battle of Luohu"", was held at the Sham Chun River, the border between Hong Kong and Shenzhen. The two battled all night, but the match was eventually stopped by a Zen master. Returning home, the headmaster had strongly believed that he had lost the encounter, and thus went into seclusion, trying to modernize Taoist Kung Fu with little success. He then turned his attentions to opening the Spring Flowers Gate, taking on the guise of Brother Panda to get new recruits and to comfort students at the academy. McDull, moved by his sacrifices, decides to return to training, and calls his mother to tell her to attend the competition. Eventually, the day of the competition arrives. While at the competition, McDull notices his friend from Hong Kong, May, who had enrolled in a ""wire-fu"" summer camp sponsored by Yuen Woo-Ping, also competing in the contest. Meanwhile, the headmaster has also received a revelation: at the competition, the headmaster of a rival school greets him, stating that he was a student of Pruce Lee. He goes on to state that Pruce had thought highly of the headmaster, and believed that the headmaster had won their encounter. Because of this, he had spent his last years extensively studying Taoist martial arts, and had written a book about the subject, which was dedicated to him. Meanwhile, the Mak-zi artifact had wound up at the site of the competition, and, in front of a large televised audience just as McDull's match was about to begin, the artifact suddenly comes to life, revealing to itself as a crudely-made clock in the shape of a chicken powered by cow feces which could count 100,000 years, 100 years at a time, using a complex holographic system. Inspired by the sight before her, Mrs. Mak decides to move back to Hong Kong to start a new business. McDull, having been beaten up badly in the competition, also returned to Hong Kong, having discovered Mak-zi's original blueprints for the clock in the meantime. Having returned home, McDull proceeded to build a new clock using the blueprints as a guide. The story is concluded by a flashback from an adult May, who had gone on to become an office worker, suddenly noticing McDull's clock in the sky. Taking a break from her mundane life, she traces the clock to its location, and find a quaint restaurant in the middle of Hong Kong's concrete jungle, run by the adult McDull. Throughout the film, viewers were also treated into various stories involving Mak-zi, in a pseudo-documentary style, narrated by Wan Kwong."

The film then turns to catching us up with Jesse, who as it turns out hasn’t been up to much. After his suspension, Jesse Stone sinks into seclusion and alcoholism. Ordered not to communicate with his former subordinates while on suspension, no one is able to reach him. Eventually Rose becomes concerned and asks Jesse’s friend Captain Healy, the State Police Homicide Commander, to check in on him. Healy is still recovering from his gunshot wounds, and is supposed to be on medical leave, but as he informs Jesse – he’s taking his leave at his office. Healy finds Jesse looking disheveled, drunk, and despondent. Shortly after arriving, Jesse receives a phone call from Jenn, so Healy excuses himself. Jenn tells Jesse that she needs to talk to him because she and Elliot had a fight. Angered by this, Jesse tells Jenn that they shouldn’t speak anymore, then rips the phone out of the wall and throws it across the room. Later he buys a cell phone, but Rose has to help him program it. He only gives the number to her, and a few others, warning them not to give it to anyone else. It appears that Jesse and Rose are becoming close. After a second murder in a parking garage, Healy asks Jesse to work as a private consultant to the Boston police department on the investigation. He does this partly to help his friend, but mostly because he needs Jesse’s experience. Jesse soon learns that the first victim had ties to Boston mob boss, Gino Fish. However when Jesse questions Fish about the man, Fish denies ever knowing him, as does his secretary Allen. After a third murder, Jesse questions Fish again, who then admits that he knew the first victim, but that he hadn’t seen him for a couple of days before the murder. Allen confirms this. Later Jesse takes Sister Mary John on a sort of date. At dinner he asks if Allen or Gino had been trying to get anymore young girls, but she hints to the fact that Allen and Gino are probably gay. He also discovers that the place, Milly’s, that the first victim was leaving when he was killed, was a gay bar, and a favorite destination of Allen and Gino’s. He suspects that Allen saw Gino and the first victim together there. After having sometime to contemplate the revelation that Gino and Allen are gay, and probably in a relationship, he begins to suspect that Allen may have murdered the first victim out of jealousy. Having a master’s degree in Criminal Psychology, Allen would have known that the murder would eventually be connected to him, unless he could provide another explanation for it. So he then murdered the other two to hide his motive and make it look like a serial killer. Jesse confronts Gino, and later Allen with this information. Jesse calls Allen to have him meet him at Milly’s at 3pm to discuss matters further. Allen says he won’t be there and then vomits in his toilet. He then retrieves the murder weapon and throws it in the ocean. Later, while waiting for Allen at Milly’s, Jesse witnesses Allen’s murder in a hit and run. Jesse and Commander Healy later speculate that Gino ordered this fearing that Allen’s confession would lead people to discovering Gino was gay and destroy his underworld reputation.

Ben is studying to be a geologist, so therefore he knows the desert very well. After accidentally shooting an old prospector with his Winchester Model 70 rifle and trying to cover it up, Ben argues that the honest thing to do would be for the two of them to report the accidental shot, but Madec is too important to sit in jail. It is then that Madec decides to eliminate the only witness to the crime, Ben. Madec forces Ben to strip down to nothing but his shorts at gunpoint.

After receiving her well-wishes, Laura moves out to California where she receives a tour of her new workplace at the K.E.I. offices. During her tour with future co-worker Chris , Laura meets long-time K.E.I. employee Richard Farley , who is immediately infatuated with Laura's beauty. The three go out to lunch, where Richard takes a liking to Laura, and afterwards invites her to a local tractor pull, but she politely declines the offer. Looking for a home, she later visits an apartment in Sunnyvale, and is accepted as a new roommate by the current tenant. On her first day at the office, Laura gets settled in her new work station, but is surprised to find that Richard is there waiting for her. He offers her fresh-baked blueberry bread to show his affections before leaving. In the days that follow, Laura enrolls in a local aerobics class, where Richard watches her intently as she removes her top to show off her aerobics uniform. When class ends, he asks her out to a concert and then dinner, but again, she politely turns him down. He then says that they can't have a relationship if she keeps turning him down. Laura is quick to correct him, saying that their relationship is strictly professional. In spite of this, Richard continues to make advances on Laura, seemingly convinced that he and Laura are in fact in a romantic relationship. At the K.E.I. softball game, Laura once again denies that their relationship extends beyond their workplace, but Richard stays to watch as she plays the softball game. During the game, however, Laura's new friend Glenda Moritz  takes note of Richard's infatuation with her, though Laura says she can handle him. When they start laughing over his advances, he takes this as a deeply personal insult. Richard continues to pursue Laura. Through an excuse of wanting to present a birthday for Laura, he is allowed by a coworker to see her personal dossier, from which he learns of her birthday and address. One day, he shows up at her apartment and presents her with a gift. She finds that it is an RC bulldozer, and he says ""if you're going to act like a child I'm going to have to treat you like a child"". Laura reluctantly accepts the gift while hiding her evident resentment at his frequent harassment. That night at dinner, her roommate shows concern over the situation and tells her she should confront Management about Richard, but Laura insists that she can handle him, saying that if she did otherwise, she would be his victim. As retaliation for her repeated refusals to go out with him, Farley slashes Laura's tires at home. Laura calls the police about the incident, and suspects Farley as the culprit. He later tells her he feels awful about what happens. She sarcastically replies ""I bet you do"", he then confronts her on her suspicions, warning her that if she sends any cops around him, it will mean trouble. Laura goes to KEI's management and files a formal complaint, but they prove to be of little help to her, believing that Farley liked her because she smiles at him. However, management instructs Farley to leave her alone. Eventually, Richard enrolls in the same aerobics class as Laura, much to her frustration, explaining that management told him to leave her alone at work, but cannot control him outside of work. While working on a new closet for his landlady and co-worker Nancy Hammond , Richard is confronted by Nancy, who says very gently that Laura is not interested in him. Richard persists however and photographs Laura from the yard in front of her house, and seemingly shows up everywhere she goes. With the harassment increasing, Laura and her roommate move away to a new apartment. In spite of the move, Richard breaks into Laura's office and discovers her new address, as well as her family records. He confronts her at the offices and threatens to go after her sisters if she does not learn to accept that she ""is meant for him"". Her horror only worsens at Christmas when Laura goes home to Virginia to be with her family, and receives a gift from Richard. It is a doctored photograph of the two of them together on ""their summer vacation"". Grief-stricken, Laura confesses the situation to her family, who insist that they help her get out of this before it boils over. Laura refuses their help, insisting that she loves her job and will not let Farley intimidate her. However, she files a second complaint to K.E.I.'s management, only to find herself at square one once again. At a restaurant, Laura is in the women's washroom when Farley barges in and angrily accuses Laura of thinking he is a joke. She corrects him, he then angrily says ""don't talk down to me"" and violently smashes the bathroom mirror and threatens her for not accepting his advances. He asks her if she is resisting his advances because she wants to ""win"", she then corrects him again, saying she merely wants him to leave her alone. Laura reports the incident, and the work force managers confront Farley on his actions, who insist that his frequent harassment is illegal. Unfazed, Richard declares that he will kill anyone who attempts to interfere with his ""private relationships"", and is fired for this death threat. Angered at the loss of his job, Farley seriously considers the fulfillment of his previous threats. In the months that follow, Richard gets a new job at a rival company, but the harassment continues on an irregular basis. Laura starts dating Sam Waters , who fears for Laura's safety. To protect her, he teaches her how to use a gun for self-defense, and promises to take it back if she finds herself uncomfortable with the weapon. That night, Richard breaks into her garage and leaves a note on her windshield. Laura confronts him and he casually brushes it off with yet another advance. Laura almost draws the gun from behind her back, but ultimately relents. At work, Laura receives a major promotion but can't get it because of improper clearance. Thinking it to be because of Richard's harassment, Chris suggests that Laura get a restraining order against Richard. Laura follows through and Farley receives the order from the court. Enraged at this turn of events, Farley decides it is time to get even with Laura. He sells his pickup to a co-worker and purchases an RV, as well as several shotguns and over 2000 rounds of ammunition. At work, Laura is anxious about her upcoming court appearance to make the restraining order against Farley permanent. That afternoon, Farley drives up in front of the K.E.I. offices in his RV, and loads up several shotguns and revolvers with ammunition, as well as several explosives. Upon exiting the RV, Farley advances on the building, and shoots one of his co-workers with a shotgun. He then blasts his way through the lobby firing at random employees, who run for cover and call the police. Farley advances up the stairwell where he shoots two unsuspecting employees, and then blasts his way into the secure offices. Panic ensues as all personnel flee the building and take cover in their offices, with several more being gunned down by Farley. Among Richard's victims is Glenda, who pleads for her life as Farley blasts her through an office window, killing her. Hearing the gunshots, Laura calls for security when Richard bursts into her office and takes aim. Laura ducks for cover but is shot in the left shoulder, and collapses to the floor unconscious. Farley continues his rampage, blasting at employees, computers, and offices as he holes himself up inside the building. The police and several SWAT units arrive and evacuate the building, and surround the compound with snipers and riflemen. The police soon receive a positive identification on Farley, and discover his evident obsession with Laura, who is still trapped in the building with dozens of hostages. Hostage negotiator Lt. Grijalva  soon arrives on the scene to negotiate with Farley while the police keep an eye on the building. Meanwhile, Laura makes her way through the ransacked offices, finding the bodies of several of her co-workers as she tries to control the blood loss in her shoulder. She finds two of her surviving co-workers, who nurse her wounds while taking cover from Farley. Meanwhile, Grijalva contacts Richard and proceeds to negotiate a hopeful surrender, while also dissuading him from shooting any more employees. Richard remains stubborn, however, and attempts to make out Laura as the guilty party for refusing to go out with him, and insists that she was the one messing with him. Determined to escape, Laura flees the building despite protests from her two friends, who remain behind taking cover. Laura narrowly avoids Farley's watch as she escapes outside. Laura is rushed to a hospital for surgery, all the while blaming herself for the unfolding horror. Farley continues to hole himself up inside the building, at one point executing one of his surviving victims and unknowingly shooting Chris, who was hiding in the washrooms. However, Nancy survives the rampage and Richard allows her to leave unharmed. Grijalva keeps Richard calm by advising that all SWAT teams retreat from the building perimeter, and distracts Farley as they go in to evacuate the remaining survivors. Farley, exhausted and thinking that he will die, demands a sandwich and a diet cola from Togo's while he considers surrendering. The police agree to provide him with the food if he ditches some of his weapons through a window, all the while keeping sniper teams on watch. Hours later, the police produce the food and Farley is given the all-clear to ditch his weapons, but is soon informed that they still don't have the means to get the food to him. Grijalva suggests that he surrender and have the food outside. Finally Farley, overcome with exhaustion and dehydration, agrees to surrender to the police. At the hospital, Laura receives life-saving surgery and is placed in the intensive-care unit, where she is reunited with her roommate. At the K.E.I. offices the SWAT team, not taking any chances, converge on the main lobby as they await Farley. Richard surrenders unarmed, and is swiftly apprehended by the police, seemingly unconcerned by the carnage he has caused. The SWAT team evacuates the last remaining hostages and rescue the injured Chris, who glares at Richard as he is taken to an ambulance. Lt. Grijalva arrives with Richard's food, at which time Richard asks if Laura will remember all this. Evidently disgusted with Richard's cruelty, Grijalva silently leaves the food in the car as the police arrest Farley and escort him to prison."

She invites him to move in with her, and he accepts. She is the matriarch of a notorious Melbourne crime family, further consisting of her three sons. Her eldest son is an armed robber named Andrew 'Pope' Cody , and is in hiding from a group of renegade detectives. The middle brother, Craig , is a successful but volatile drug dealer, and youngest brother Darren ([[Luke Ford  follows the lead of his older brothers. J's uncle Craig takes J for a drive and at a traffic light, a car pulls up with two young men, with one making a few hostile remarks followed with a middle finger before taking off, possibly referencing previous altercations. Craig then follows the car, handing J a handgun, to an alley, where the car stops and the man gets out, attempting to provoke a fight between himself and Craig. Instead, Craig prompts J to get out of the car and scare off the assailant. Later, Pope's best friend and partner in crime Barry 'Baz' Brown  goes to meet Pope at a shopping center claiming that he wishes to quit the robbery game and settle down with his family, suggesting that Pope join him and the pair take up stock investment. As Baz goes to leave, he is encountered by police. After telling the police that Pope has left, the police shoot Baz dead. Pope and Craig want revenge, and ask J to steal a car and bring it to Darren's place. J complies, although they refuse to tell him the purpose. The car is then planted in the middle of a road. Two policemen are drawn to the scene, where they are ambushed and killed by Pope, Craig and Darren. The next day, Pope, Darren and J are arrested and taken in for questioning where J meets Detective Senior Sergeant Nathan Leckie  , one of the few non-corrupt police officers, who takes interest in J's situation and seeks to relieve him from it. The three are later released from custody. Later, Craig has escaped to a friend's house in regional Victoria, where he finds that he is being monitored. Despite an escape attempt, police arrive and kill Craig as he runs away. Meanwhile, J breaks up with his girlfriend Nicky at a bowling alley before Sergeant Leckie arrives and threatens to arrest him for underage drinking. Leckie takes J to a hotel, where he proposes that J be moved to a more permanent witness protection. J turns down the offer. The situation intensifies. While J is in police custody, Pope kills Nicky, as Darren watches because he incorrectly thought she had been talking to the police. When J returns to the house the next morning after spending the night with Leckie, he discovers Nicky's bracelet outside the house. He calls Nicky, and hears her cell phone near the house and realizes that she has been killed. Pope also hears the phone and comes outside. J flees the scene, running to Nicky's parents house to escape Pope. Pope chases after him but is unable to catch J. J calls on Detective Leckie and is taken into witness protection where he presumably implicates Pope and Darren in the police officers' deaths. This triggers the arrest of Pope and Darren, who are placed in jail. With Craig and Baz dead and Pope and Darren imprisoned, Smurf decides, ""J needs to go,"" as he is the star witness in the murder case. Smurf uses her connections to procure J's address and organize a police raid on that address where J is in witness protection so that he can be shot and killed. However, J escapes when he sees armed police heading for the building. J then returns to Smurf's house, saying, ""I can't live like this,"" and that he wishes to help free Pope and Darren from jail. To do this, the family's lawyer sets up J's answers so that a hole can be formed in the case, forcing the release of the pair from prison. Directly following the court session, Leckie visits J, asking him if he had found his place in the world. After Pope and Darren's release, J returns to Smurf's home asking to stay. After Smurf lets him in, J goes to greet Pope and Darren before going to his room. Pope enters and begins to talk to him, but is cut off when J shoots him in the head. In the final shot of the film, J returns to the living room to embrace Smurf."

She is a top surfer at Malibu and is nicknamed, ""Queen of the Waves"". On the day of a surfing competition, Merliah is surfing mavericks, when one part of her hair suddenly turns pink on contact with seawater. Nervous of showing everyone her hair, she dives underwater and meets a pink-ish purple coloured, dolphin named Zuma. Merliah finds out she can breathe underwater. After telling her grandfather what happened, Merliah finds out that she is half-mermaid. Thinking that her parents died when she was a small baby, Merliah's grandfather tells her the truth. Break tells her that Merliah's father was a human named Rip and that her mother was a mermaid named Calissa .Break tells her that when Merliah's father died, Calissa was worried about the fact that Calissa's evil mermaid sister Eris would try to rule over. At the same time, Calissa gave birth to Merliah. Merliah had no tail which made it dangerous for her in Oceana. Calissa didn't want Merliah to get hurt, so she took Merliah to her grandfather, Break. Calissa asked if Break could raise Merliah so that she would be safer on land from Eris's rule.At first, Merliah didn't believe Break and left to tell her friends what happened. After telling her friends the news, Hadley was excited and believed that Merliah is of mermaid royalty. Just then, Zuma appears and says that it is true about what Break said, but Merliah at first didn't believe anything and in anger she throws the necklace she'd been wearing ever since she was an infant, it reveals Calissa is still alive, spinning Merillia, the life force of the sea. She also tells Merliah that the reason her hair is pink, that she can breathe underwater, is because she is part mermaid. Merliah decides to try to rescue her mother and save the kingdom. With Zuma as her guide, Merliah arrives in Oceana just when the ""Eris Festival"" starts. Zuma explains that ever since Eris ruled Oceana, her Merillia was not as strong as Calissa's, which made the ocean weak. Most of the coral has turned brown, much like the autumn leaves. During the ""Eris Festival"", Merliah and Zuma hide in a nearby shop. Merliah is terrified, as Eris controls Oceana in an evil way trapping people she doesn't like in whirlpools, and doubts she can save Oceana. After the festival ends, Zuma takes Merliah to a boutique which is owned by two mermaids, Kayla and Xylie.They chose to help her after their pet seal Snouts licks her ticklish toes making her laugh, and they make Merliah look like a mermaid.The team seeks out the Destinies, three small stylish mermaids who have prophetic powers. Just before they arrive, they hear Eris storming that she will destroy Calissa's daughter. Merliah hides, while Kayla and Xylie point Eris in the wrong direction. While Eris is distracted, Merliah and Zuma meet the Destinies. They reveal in order for the team to succeed in overthrowing Eris, they need ""three tools that are spread far and wide"": The Celestial Comb, a Dreamfish and Eris' protective necklace. They set out to look for the items. First, with Fallon and Hadley's help, they find the Celestial Comb in a cave guarded by three giant jellyfish. Kayla, Xylie and Zuma lure the jellyfish away while Merliah and Snouts look for the comb. Merliah manages to get it and escapes from the cave just before it caves in. Next, they find the Dreamfish, yet again with Fallon's and Hadley's internet help, in the Adenato currents. Merliah gets one to promise to grant her a wish later on by impressing it with her surfing skills. Lastly, they get Eris' protective necklace by distracting her with some music and a song.

26331478	/m/0bbtm7p	Pokhi	1998			"{""/m/019vzt"": ""Assamese Language""}"	{}	{}	"Barbie in A Mermaid Tale is about a sixteen-year-old girl called Merliah Summers, . She is a top surfer at Malibu and is nicknamed, ""Queen of the Waves"". On the day of a surfing competition, Merliah is surfing mavericks, when one part of her hair suddenly turns pink on contact with seawater. Nervous of showing everyone her hair, she dives underwater and meets a pink-ish purple coloured, dolphin named Zuma. Merliah finds out she can breathe underwater. After telling her grandfather what happened, Merliah finds out that she is half-mermaid. Thinking that her parents died when she was a small baby, Merliah's grandfather tells her the truth. Break tells her that Merliah's father was a human named Rip and that her mother was a mermaid named Calissa .Break tells her that when Merliah's father died, Calissa was worried about the fact that Calissa's evil mermaid sister Eris would try to rule over. At the same time, Calissa gave birth to Merliah. Merliah had no tail which made it dangerous for her in Oceana. Calissa didn't want Merliah to get hurt, so she took Merliah to her grandfather, Break. Calissa asked if Break could raise Merliah so that she would be safer on land from Eris's rule.At first, Merliah didn't believe Break and left to tell her friends what happened. After telling her friends the news, Hadley was excited and believed that Merliah is of mermaid royalty. Just then, Zuma appears and says that it is true about what Break said, but Merliah at first didn't believe anything and in anger she throws the necklace she'd been wearing ever since she was an infant, it reveals Calissa is still alive, spinning Merillia, the life force of the sea. She also tells Merliah that the reason her hair is pink, that she can breathe underwater, is because she is part mermaid. Merliah decides to try to rescue her mother and save the kingdom. With Zuma as her guide, Merliah arrives in Oceana just when the ""Eris Festival"" starts. Zuma explains that ever since Eris ruled Oceana, her Merillia was not as strong as Calissa's, which made the ocean weak. Most of the coral has turned brown, much like the autumn leaves. During the ""Eris Festival"", Merliah and Zuma hide in a nearby shop. Merliah is terrified, as Eris controls Oceana in an evil way trapping people she doesn't like in whirlpools, and doubts she can save Oceana. After the festival ends, Zuma takes Merliah to a boutique which is owned by two mermaids, Kayla and Xylie.They chose to help her after their pet seal Snouts licks her ticklish toes making her laugh, and they make Merliah look like a mermaid.The team seeks out the Destinies, three small stylish mermaids who have prophetic powers. Just before they arrive, they hear Eris storming that she will destroy Calissa's daughter. Merliah hides, while Kayla and Xylie point Eris in the wrong direction. While Eris is distracted, Merliah and Zuma meet the Destinies. They reveal in order for the team to succeed in overthrowing Eris, they need ""three tools that are spread far and wide"": The Celestial Comb, a Dreamfish and Eris' protective necklace. They set out to look for the items. First, with Fallon and Hadley's help, they find the Celestial Comb in a cave guarded by three giant jellyfish. Kayla, Xylie and Zuma lure the jellyfish away while Merliah and Snouts look for the comb. Merliah manages to get it and escapes from the cave just before it caves in. Next, they find the Dreamfish, yet again with Fallon's and Hadley's internet help, in the Adenato currents. Merliah gets one to promise to grant her a wish later on by impressing it with her surfing skills. Lastly, they get Eris' protective necklace by distracting her with some music and a song. Furious, Eris spins a whirlpool in order to get rid of Merliah. Merliah gets sucked into the whirlpool. Desperate, Merliah calls on the Dreamfish which offers to send her back to Malibu, her mermaid half to go away and it as if none of this has ever happened. Merliah hesitates and rejects the wish.

In a warehouse, the Joker brutally beats Robin with a crowbar while Batman races there. Joker then leaves the warehouse and traps a half-dead Robin inside. Although he attempts to escape, a planted explosive destroys the building, taking Robin with it as Batman arrives too late to save him. Five years later in Gotham City, a masked man known as Red Hood takes command of the drug trade, assuring eight prominent heads of the business protection from Batman and the crime lord Black Mask in return. The heads initially decline, but Red Hood tosses them a bag full of the heads of their lieutenants, easily changing their minds. Elsewhere, Batman intercepts a stolen truck carrying Amazo, an android weapon, and Nightwing arrives to help take it down. The drivers reveal they were under Red Hood’s orders before being assassinated by their employer. Batman gives chase and eventually ends up at the chemical plant that created the Joker, where Red Hood confronts him and comments that it is the place where Batman made his first great failure. Red Hood then escapes. Afterward, Batman and Nightwing interrogate Joker at Arkham Asylum for information; the clown merely taunts them with Robin’s death and denies involvement. Angered over his stolen android, Black Mask puts out a hit on Red Hood who promptly hijacks another weapon shipment, with Batman and Nightwing expectedly interrupting. During a chase over the city rooftops, Red Hood is seen to display exceptional physical skills, beyond those of a regular criminal and disturbingly similar to Batman and Nightwing's. Red Hood then eludes them at a train station, where a planted bomb explodes and Nightwing injures his leg in the process. Back at the Batcave, Bruce sends Dick home and then discovers Red Hood knows his secret identity. Bruce also recalls that Jason once used such escape maneuvers and also remembers that he became violent and impulsive as he grew older. On the streets, Red Hood is attacked by the Fearsome Hand of Four, a group of four assassins who had been hired by Black Mask as part of his efforts to take down the Red Hood. He stalls them to lure Batman out, and together they incapacitate three while Red Hood murders one. When Batman confronts him about it, Red Hood insists that he is taking criminals  out, doing what the Dark Knight is unwilling to do. Batman asked what happened to him and offers help, but is quickly rebuffed and Red Hood leaves. Bruce later uses a blood sample from the battle to confirm that Red Hood is in fact Jason Todd, back from the dead. Meanwhile, Red Hood fires a rocket-propelled grenade into Black Mask's office, nearly killing the crime lord. Pushed to his breaking point, Black Mask cuts a deal with the Joker: he will be released from Arkham in exchange for killing Red Hood. Bruce discovers the body in Jason’s coffin is indeed a fake. Enraged, he visits Ra's al Ghul – the man responsible – for the truth. Ra's reveals that five years previous he commissioned the Joker to distract the Dynamic Duo during their investigation into a terrorist plot committed by Ra's, but the clown kidnapped and murdered Robin, which Ra's saw as unnecessary and without cause. To make amends, Ra's chose not to make war with Batman anymore and secretly attempted to revive Jason in the Lazarus Pit, which yielded disastrous results: Jason came back wild and fled. Meanwhile, Joker abducts Black Mask and his associates, binding and gagging them but leaving Black Mask free to speak, to burn them alive in a lorry in a bid for Red Hood’s attention. Red Hood reveals his plan the whole time was to intimidate Black Mask into freeing Joker and arrange a meeting. Batman intervenes, saving the criminals, but Red Hood gets away with a captured Joker in tow. Red Hood takes Joker to an abandoned apartment and vengefully beats Joker with a crowbar in the same manner as Joker did to him years ago. He then meets Batman in Crime Alley, where they first met. There, they fight, and when the fight is taken to a rooftop, Red Hood is unmasked and is indeed Jason, who insists that he is a better vigilante because of his willingness to control crime and kill. Batman tells him he’ll never be better that way and the fight continues into the apartment where Joker is stored. When Jason holds Batman at gunpoint, Batman expresses his guilt over the incident. Jason forgives him, but is angry that Batman still lets the Joker live. Batman says that although he’s thought every day about killing Joker, he can’t, because he knows if he starts killing, he’ll never stop. Dissatisfied with the answer, Jason gives Batman a gun and an ultimatum by demanding he choose between them: either Jason will shoot the Joker, or Batman has to shoot Jason to stop him. Batman silently declines participation, drops the gun, and walks away. Distraught, Jason aims his gun at his former mentor before it is quickly disabled. Jason, defeated and purposeless, activates a bomb, and slumps to the ground in resignation. Batman knocks the Joker aside to try and save Jason as the explosive goes off. When the smoke clears, the Joker and Batman are revealed to have survived, but Jason is nowhere to be found. In the aftermath of the incident, a news report reveals that Joker was returned to Arkham and Black Mask is back on the streets after paying a million dollars bail, albeit under investigation for Joker's escape; Nightwing and Ra's watch the report, the latter brooding on the recent events that he caused. At the Batcave, Alfred asks Bruce if he should take down the memorial holding Jason’s old Robin costume in the Batcave due to recent events. Bruce refuses, saying nothing has changed. A final memory shows Jason’s first day as Robin, and the young boy declares happily that it is the best day of his life.

Angered over his stolen android, Black Mask puts out a hit on Red Hood who promptly hijacks another weapon shipment, with Batman and Nightwing expectedly interrupting. During a chase over the city rooftops, Red Hood is seen to display exceptional physical skills, beyond those of a regular criminal and disturbingly similar to Batman and Nightwing's. Red Hood then eludes them at a train station, where a planted bomb explodes and Nightwing injures his leg in the process. Back at the Batcave, Bruce sends Dick home and then discovers Red Hood knows his secret identity. Bruce also recalls that Jason once used such escape maneuvers and also remembers that he became violent and impulsive as he grew older. On the streets, Red Hood is attacked by the Fearsome Hand of Four, a group of four assassins who had been hired by Black Mask as part of his efforts to take down the Red Hood. He stalls them to lure Batman out, and together they incapacitate three while Red Hood murders one. When Batman confronts him about it, Red Hood insists that he is taking criminals  out, doing what the Dark Knight is unwilling to do. Batman asked what happened to him and offers help, but is quickly rebuffed and Red Hood leaves. Bruce later uses a blood sample from the battle to confirm that Red Hood is in fact Jason Todd, back from the dead. Meanwhile, Red Hood fires a rocket-propelled grenade into Black Mask's office, nearly killing the crime lord. Pushed to his breaking point, Black Mask cuts a deal with the Joker: he will be released from Arkham in exchange for killing Red Hood. Bruce discovers the body in Jason’s coffin is indeed a fake. Enraged, he visits Ra's al Ghul – the man responsible – for the truth. Ra's reveals that five years previous he commissioned the Joker to distract the Dynamic Duo during their investigation into a terrorist plot committed by Ra's, but the clown kidnapped and murdered Robin, which Ra's saw as unnecessary and without cause. To make amends, Ra's chose not to make war with Batman anymore and secretly attempted to revive Jason in the Lazarus Pit, which yielded disastrous results: Jason came back wild and fled. Meanwhile, Joker abducts Black Mask and his associates, binding and gagging them but leaving Black Mask free to speak, to burn them alive in a lorry in a bid for Red Hood’s attention. Red Hood reveals his plan the whole time was to intimidate Black Mask into freeing Joker and arrange a meeting. Batman intervenes, saving the criminals, but Red Hood gets away with a captured Joker in tow. Red Hood takes Joker to an abandoned apartment and vengefully beats Joker with a crowbar in the same manner as Joker did to him years ago. He then meets Batman in Crime Alley, where they first met. There, they fight, and when the fight is taken to a rooftop, Red Hood is unmasked and is indeed Jason, who insists that he is a better vigilante because of his willingness to control crime and kill. Batman tells him he’ll never be better that way and the fight continues into the apartment where Joker is stored. When Jason holds Batman at gunpoint, Batman expresses his guilt over the incident. Jason forgives him, but is angry that Batman still lets the Joker live. Batman says that although he’s thought every day about killing Joker, he can’t, because he knows if he starts killing, he’ll never stop. Dissatisfied with the answer, Jason gives Batman a gun and an ultimatum by demanding he choose between them: either Jason will shoot the Joker, or Batman has to shoot Jason to stop him. Batman silently declines participation, drops the gun, and walks away. Distraught, Jason aims his gun at his former mentor before it is quickly disabled. Jason, defeated and purposeless, activates a bomb, and slumps to the ground in resignation. Batman knocks the Joker aside to try and save Jason as the explosive goes off. When the smoke clears, the Joker and Batman are revealed to have survived, but Jason is nowhere to be found. In the aftermath of the incident, a news report reveals that Joker was returned to Arkham and Black Mask is back on the streets after paying a million dollars bail, albeit under investigation for Joker's escape; Nightwing and Ra's watch the report, the latter brooding on the recent events that he caused. At the Batcave, Alfred asks Bruce if he should take down the memorial holding Jason’s old Robin costume in the Batcave due to recent events. Bruce refuses, saying nothing has changed. A final memory shows Jason’s first day as Robin, and the young boy declares happily that it is the best day of his life.

The rest of the film is told in flashback. Cecil Rhodes  has a great desire to acquire land in the region of the Boers for its gold deposits. He sends Dr Jameson  there to provoke border disturbances, and secures support from Joseph Chamberlain . When Chamberlain seeks the support of Queen Victoria  and her son Edward VII The Prince of Wales , she initially refuses but changes her mind when informed of the gold in the region. She invites Paul Krüger to London, and believes she is tricking him into signing a treaty. Krüger, being suspicious of the British, has his own plans. Krüger signs the treaty which gives the British access to the gold; however, he imposes high taxes and establishes a monopoly over the sale of TNT which forces the British to buy explosives at high prices. Hence, ultimately, Krüger out-tricks the British with the signing of the treaty. This impresses some of the British as they find an equal in Krüger in matters of cunning, which is supposed to be the defining characteristic of the British. Having been out-tricked, Rhodes tries to buy Krüger's allegiance. Krüger and his wife Sanna , however, is incorruptible. After being rejected, Rhodes shows Krüger a long list of members of the Boer council that work for the British. Krüger then becomes convinced that war is inevitable if the Boers are to keep their land. He declares war. Initially, the Boers are in the ascendancy, leading Britain to appoint Lord Kitchener  as Supreme Commander of the armed forces. Kitchener launches an attack on the civilian population, destroying their homes, using some as human shields and placing the women and children in concentration camps, in an attempt to damage the morale of the Boer Army. Krüger's son Jan , who has pro-British sentiments due to his Oxford education, visits a concentration camp to find his wife, Petra . He is caught and hanged, with his wife watching. When the women respond in anger, they are massacred. The flashback concludes in the Geneva hotel room. A dying Krüger prophesies the destruction of Britain by major world powers, which will make the world a better place to live in.

All are surfers, but she and her best friend Alana Blanchard  have grown up with a passion for the sport and enter a competition. Her church youth ministry leader, Sarah Hill , is disappointed when she has to withdraw from a planned missions trip because of the contest. Bethany and Alana place first and third, respectively, while the second place winner, Malina Birch , proves to be resentful. Bethany invites both girls up on the winner's box with her, but Malina ungraciously refuses. The Rip Curl surfwear company offers to sponsor her and Alana in competition. The night before Halloween, Alana and Bethany sneak off with some friends to go surfing. Later while Tom goes to the hospital for knee surgery, both girls go surfing with Alana's father Holt  and brother Byron . As Bethany dangles her left arm in the water, a tiger shark appears out of nowhere and sinks its teeth into it, biting it off near the shoulder. Holt gets Bethany out of the water and puts a tourniquet on her while Byron calls 911. An ambulance meets them on the way to the hospital. Just before starting Tom's knee surgery, Dr. David Rovinsky  is called to the emergency room to treat Bethany. Besides losing her left arm, Bethany also lost 60% of her blood and David calls her survival a miracle. The onslaught of paparazzi also proves to be a great strain on her family and their privacy. The Hamiltons are grateful to Holt for his quick and super active thinking and decisive action that saved her life. Bethany's injury prevents her participating in the Rip Curl photo shoots, but she wishes Alana well. Inside Edition, a television program, offers to provide a prosthetic arm that is cosmetically perfect and has bendable joints, in exchange for an interview. Bethany angrily rejects it when she learns it will not help her surf as it is not weight bearing, as a result of the size of her arm stump. Bethany perseveres and, after a recuperation period, gets back in the water and learns to surf with one arm, eventually re-entering the competition. She tells her rival Malina not to go easy on her, and rejects a five-minute head start offered by the judges. She does not perform well because she cannot stay on the board long enough to go out and catch a competitive wave and Malina wins. Disappointed, she decides to give up competitive surfing. Bethany sees the effects of the 2004 tsunami on television, which places her own problems in perspective. She decides to surprise Sarah by joining the youth group on another mission trip to help the devastated people of Phuket, Thailand. They are understandably afraid of the water, including a little boy. Bethany decides to go into it with a surfboard, hoping this will coax him into it. It works, and the realization that she can use her gift to inspire people motivates her to take up surfing again. Tom rigs a handle on her surfboard which she can use to prevent falling off while paddling out to the waves, which is not prohibited by the competition's rules. He also voices the belief that she possesses a great surfer's instinct for sensing when the best waves will form. She enters the national championship, thanks Malina for treating her as a serious competitor, and performs respectably, though she is still chasing third place. Suddenly, with only minutes left on the clock, the waves die down and all the surfers can only loiter, waiting for the waves to start back up. Tom's belief in his daughter's instinct is proven when she is the only one to sense a big wave forming, and she alone paddles out. When it forms, the others cannot get out in time and she catches it just as the horn sounds. If it is in time, she will win, but the judges rule that the time has expired. Malina is the winner, but she has finally gotten over her differences with her, inviting her up on the platform to share first place. Subsequently, Bethany lets the reporters interview her. One asks her what she would do if given the chance to undo the loss of her arm. She says that she would still lose it because she can embrace more people now than she ever could with both. The film ends with real video of Bethany surfing after the attack. Also showing video of interviews and special appearances that she has made.
